0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""ending my life again"", ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""Never will find love"", ""mental breakdown"", ""everything in my life is crap even me"", ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself"". These indicate hopelessness, worthlessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans: ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" clearly states a specific method (jumping) and a specific location (a bridge).
    - Past concrete actions: The phrase ""ending my life again"" suggests past suicidal ideation or thoughts, but it does not describe a concrete past action taken to attempt suicide (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off,"" which are explicit mentions of suicide and a clear desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent is present (from Step 2).
    - The post mentions a specific **method**: ""jump off"".
    - The post mentions a specific **location**: ""a bridge"".
    - These elements constitute a plan as defined for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""Ending my life again"" refers to recurring thoughts/ideation, not a described past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and mentions suicide (""ending my life again""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere ideation by including a specific method (""jump off"") and a specific location (""a bridge"") for carrying out suicide. This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - While ""again"" hints at past struggles, there is no description of a concrete past action, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I'm going to die soon"" is a direct statement about dying.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm inconsolable"" indicates extreme distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or preparations are mentioned. ""soon"" is a timeframe, but it is vague and not a *specific* timeframe as defined for 'Behavior' (e.g., ""tonight"", ""on my 21st birthday"").
    - Past concrete actions: No past actions described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"".
    - However, ""I'm going to die soon"" in the context of ""I'm inconsolable"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die or believing one's life is ending due to distress. The 'Ideation' definition specifically includes ""I'm going to die soon"" when in a context of distress. So, Yes, there is a clear desire to die/cease existing. This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation?
        - Method: No.
        - Means: No.
        - Location: No.
        - Specific timeframe: ""soon"" is mentioned. This is not specific enough to meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (e.g., ""tonight"", ""on my birthday"", ""at 21""). The guideline is to choose 'Ideation' if genuinely uncertain about the presence of an *explicit* plan. ""Soon"" is ambiguous.
        - Preparation: No.
    - Therefore, there is no explicit plan as defined for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm going to die soon"" in a context of severe distress) which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, *specific* timeframe, or preparation) as defined for 'Behavior'. ""Soon"" is too vague for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the 'Ideation' category: clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without a specific plan.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No direct mentions of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm."" However, ""I hate living"" is a strong expression of not wanting to be alive.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I hate living"" clearly indicates despair, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life. The ""fuck"" reinforces strong negative emotion.
    - Specific plans: No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I hate living"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of not wanting to be alive, which is explicitly listed as an example for 'Ideation'.
    - Since there is a clear desire to not be alive, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There are no elements of a plan present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There is no description of what the person *did* in the past to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to not be alive (""I hate living""), which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - It does not contain any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - It expresses more than general distress; it expresses a clear desire not to be alive, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""kill myself"" (direct).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The plea ""Help me,"" ""Please somebody help me"" indicates significant distress and desperation.
    *   **Specific plans:** Yes, the post mentions ""barbiturates/Nembutal"" as specific means/method and asks for help finding them, indicating intent to acquire them for suicide. This is a clear element of a plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No mention of past actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post contains the explicit phrase ""kill myself."" This is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die/commit suicide.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on the clear suicidal intent from Step 2, the post also mentions:
        *   A specific **method** for suicide: Implied overdose using ""barbiturates/Nembutal.""
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: The user is asking for help to ""find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,"" which indicates an active intent to acquire these means for suicide.
    *   This clearly meets the criteria for 'Behavior' as it includes both suicidal intent and a specific plan element (method/means, and seeking to acquire them).

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. It focuses on current intent and seeking means.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""Help me kill myself,"" indicating clear suicidal intent (eliminates 'Indicator').
    *   It then immediately follows with a request to ""help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,"" which specifies a method and means, and shows active steps towards acquiring them. This constitutes a specific plan as defined for 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Since a specific plan (method/means and intent to acquire) is present, it is 'Behavior' and not 'Ideation'.

I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired.

    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""whats the point of living,"" ""want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" ""should do it anyways,"" ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""pointless,"" ""huge waste of time,"" ""feeling that life is all pointless.""

    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.

Although the poster states ""but I don't actually want to,"" the presence of these intrusive suicidal thoughts is explicitly stated, which aligns with the 'Ideation' definition of ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This means it is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - No, the post does not mention any specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

    - There is no description of a past concrete action of an attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' because it describes explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan. The statement ""but I don't actually want to"" indicates intrusive ideation rather than a desired plan, but it is still an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""kill myself"" and ""I want to die now, right now in this instant"". It also mentions ""erase all traces of my existence"" and ""shoot their heads off like me"" (though the latter is a comparative statement, it reinforces the suicidal context).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is saturated with indicators of severe distress: ""no today, nor tommorrow"", ""dont have anything"", ""days are just passing me by"", ""stuck, stagnant"", ""no space for me"", ""incurable disease or something is wrong with my brain"", ""damaged"", ""cant feel nothing"", ""falling down this void"", ""havent cried once"", ""too weird, my face is weird, my demeanor is weird"", feelings of worthlessness (""everyone is going to be better without me"").

        *   Specific **means**: ""knife"" and ""some opioids"".

    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings by detailing specific methods (""run towards a cop with a knife"", ""find a dealer with some opioids"") and a very immediate timeframe (""now, right now in this instant""). This aligns perfectly with the 'Behavior' definition, which requires explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND a plan (method, means, timeframe).
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

        *   A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No.
        *   Clear signs of preparation? No.
    *   Conclusion for Step 3: No specific plan elements are present.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to end their life (""I just want to get it over with,"" ""if I go through with it"" referring to a suicidal act), which means it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   However, it does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation), so it's not 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action of a suicide attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes a clear desire to not be alive any longer without a specific plan.

11,"When I encounter new people, in person or online. I always think to myself ""when will they leave?"". Such a fucked up way to feel about a person I barely even know but in my experience no one sticks around. everyone leaves you eventually. Especially the ones who promised they would stay. I start reflecting thinking hmm maybe it's me?. But then I realize I push people away unintentionally because I already have the mind frame of they will leave so it's more like ""let's get this over with"". and the ones who are reluctant to stay I don't necessarily give them a reason to. so shucks, I'd leave too. I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No direct mentions. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is metaphorical, expressing self-loathing or a wish to escape one's own feelings/situation, not a literal desire to die or commit suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fucked up way to feel,"" ""no one sticks around,"" ""everyone leaves you eventually,"" ""it starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts."" These indicate feelings of abandonment, loneliness, self-blame (""maybe it's me?""), and persistent emotional pain.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is metaphorical for wanting to escape one's own being or circumstances, not a literal desire to die. The post focuses on relational pain and self-perception, not a wish for life to end.
    *   Since the answer to both is 'No', the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Not applicable, as no clear suicidal intent or desire to die was identified in Step 2.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant emotional distress, feelings of worthlessness, and pain related to interpersonal relationships and abandonment.
    *   It does *not* contain any explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or a clear, unambiguous desire to die or end one's life. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is interpreted as a metaphorical expression of self-dislike or a wish to escape one's own painful feelings, not a literal desire for death.
    *   Therefore, it aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive... it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'."" This post does not express a clear desire not to be alive in a literal sense.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""i plan to kill myself at 21"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""i am not ok,"" ""severely codependent,"" ""constant anxiety, self doubt, and mistrust,"" ""feel really small,"" ""very unhealthy,"" ""no hope,"" ""feel braindead,"" ""constant loneliness,"" ""anhedonic and dissociative,"" ""this is hell."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
    - Specific plans: ""i plan to kill myself at 21"" includes a specific timeframe (""at 21"") for the suicidal act.
    - Past concrete actions: There are no descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains an explicit mention of ""kill myself.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2, the post explicitly mentions ""i plan to kill myself at 21."" This includes a specific **timeframe** (""at 21"") for carrying out the suicide. This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""i plan to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere ideation by including a specific element of a plan: a defined **timeframe** (""at 21""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I want to die."" ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case."" (Direct mention of ""die"" and ""kill myself"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't like anything about myself,"" ""I hate my job and my family,"" ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence,"" ""sick and tried of crying myself to slee every night."" (Worthlessness, hopelessness, despair, anhedonia).
    *   **Specific plans:** The post explicitly states ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case."" This is a *negation* of an immediate plan and sets a *future conditional timeframe* (5 years), but not a plan *to commit suicide* within that timeframe. It's a statement about delaying, not planning an action. There is no mention of method, means, or location. The question ""Can someone tell me how to go about existing without feeling anything?"" indicates a desire to cope with the pain, not a plan for suicide. ""I have all my social media deactivated"" is a sign of withdrawal but not explicitly stated as preparation for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains ""I want to die"" (clear desire to die) and ""I am not going to kill myself"" (explicit mention of ""kill myself"").
    *   Since there's a clear desire to die and explicit suicide terms, it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    *   Does the post mention:
        *   A specific **method**? No.
        *   Specific **means**? No.
        *   A specific **location**? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide? The post states ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case."" This is a *postponement* or a *limit* to their suffering, not a specific timeframe *for the act* itself. It's a conditional statement (""just in case""), not a plan to act at that future point. The definition of 'Behavior' for timeframe is ""I'm ending it tonight,"" ""I plan to do it on my birthday,"" ""I'll kill myself at 21"" – these imply intent to act *at* that time. The post's statement is about *not* acting now and setting a future boundary.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? No explicit preparation for suicide (like writing notes, giving away things). Deactivating social media is a sign of withdrawal, but not necessarily preparation for suicide.
    *   Given the explicit negation of immediate suicide and the conditional nature of the 5-year timeframe, there is no clear, specific plan as required for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No description of a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I want to die"") and mentions ""kill myself,"" ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die. However, it explicitly *negates* immediate action (""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon"") and the 5-year mention is a conditional limit to endurance, not a specific plan (method, means, location, or clear intent to act at that time). The request ""Can someone tell me how to go about existing without feeling anything?"" further supports a state of distress and ideation rather than a concrete plan for suicide. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        - ""I feel like the only way out is suicide."" (Direct mention of suicide)
        - ""I've considered hanging"" (Direct mention of a method for suicide, but immediately followed by ""but I can't seem to go through with it."")
        - ""I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts."" (Indirect desire to end life, with a clear statement of lacking intent/ability to act).
    - **Emotional indicators:** High levels of distress, hopelessness, worthlessness, anhedonia, feeling stuck, overwhelmed, scared, empty, and unable to cope with life's demands.
    - **Specific plans:** The post mentions ""I've considered hanging,"" which is a specific method. However, this is immediately qualified by ""but I can't seem to go through with it"" and earlier ""I don't really have the guts to do it."" This explicitly negates the presence of a *current* plan or intent to act on that method. There are no mentions of acquiring means, specific locations, timeframes, or preparations for an imminent act.
    - **Past concrete actions:** No descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. ""I've tried over and over again"" refers to job performance, not suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" (""I feel like the only way out is suicide"") and a clear desire to die/end life (""I should just make my escape""). It also mentions considering a specific method (""hanging""), which is a form of suicidal ideation.
    - Since there are explicit mentions and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post mentions ""I've considered hanging,"" which is a specific method. However, the critical phrases ""I don't really have the guts to do it"" and ""I can't seem to go through with it"" explicitly state that the poster does not have the intent or ability to execute this plan. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a plan *to commit suicide*, implying current intent or preparation. A mere consideration of a method, immediately negated by a lack of guts/ability to act, does not constitute a plan for 'Behavior' according to the definitions. There are no other elements of a plan (means, location, specific timeframe, preparations) that the poster is currently acting on or intending to act on.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there are explicit mentions of suicide and a clear desire to die.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because, despite considering a specific method (""hanging""), the poster explicitly states they lack the ""guts"" or ability to ""go through with it."" This means there is no *current* plan with intent to act. The consideration of a method without intent to execute it falls under ideation.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete actions are described.
    - The post expresses clear suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life, but without a concrete, actionable plan. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i already know i'm going to kill myself"", ""suicidal notes"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"" indicates severe distress and hopelessness about continuing to live.
    - Specific plans: ""i already got my suicidal notes ready"" is a clear sign of preparation. ""just a matter of when and how"" indicates intent to finalize a plan. ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"" indicates a timeframe (within the next year).
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"".
    - This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post explicitly states ""i already know i'm going to kill myself and i've decided on it,"" showing suicidal intent.
    - It also mentions ""i already got my suicidal notes ready,"" which is a clear sign of preparation for suicide.
    - ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"" indicates a specific timeframe (within the next year).
    - These elements (preparation and timeframe) classify it as 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses clear suicidal intent (""i'm going to kill myself"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""sick of seeing my face,"" ""tired of having to get dressed and seeing my body,"" ""feel so ugly and horrible,"" ""hate everything about myself,"" ""still look disgusting."" These indicate severe self-loathing, body dysmorphia, and general distress.
    - Specific plans: None. No methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? The post states ""i just wish i could press a button and be someone else"" and ""i just want to be someone else."" While this expresses a strong desire to escape from their current self and identity, it does not explicitly or unambiguously express a desire to *die*, *not be alive*, or *cease existing*. It's a wish for transformation, not cessation of life.
    - Since there are no explicit suicide terms AND no clear desire to die expressed, the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no clear suicidal intent or desire to die established in Step 2.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant distress, self-hatred, and body image issues. It states ""I feel so ugly and horrible"" and ""I hate everything about myself.""
    - The phrase ""i just wish i could press a button and be someone else"" or ""i just want to be someone else"" expresses a desire to escape from their current identity or self, but it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' which requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I wish I could disappear,"" ""I want it to be over"")."" The desire to ""be someone else"" is not equivalent to a desire to die or cease to exist.
    - There are no mentions of suicide, no plans, and no past attempts.
    - Therefore, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category, as it contains general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, without a clear desire to die or explicit suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""kill themselves"" and ""hurt themselves,"" but these are in the context of discussing *other people's posts* about suicide, not the poster's own feelings or intentions.
    - Emotional indicators: The poster is asking a question and expressing an opinion (""In my opinion...""), not indicating personal distress, hopelessness, or despair.
    - Specific plans: None. The poster is not discussing any plans for themselves.
    - Past concrete actions: None. The poster is not describing any past actions of their own.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill themselves"" is mentioned. However, the crucial point is ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"". The poster is *not* expressing a desire to kill themselves. They are commenting on others who do.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The poster is asking a question about the motivations of others.
    - Since the explicit mention of ""kill themselves"" is not related to the poster's own intent or desire to die, it does not qualify as the poster expressing suicidal intent. Therefore, the post lacks a clear desire to die from the person writing it.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable. There is no suicidal intent from the poster.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Not applicable. There is no description of a past concrete action taken by the poster to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post is a meta-commentary about other people's posts regarding suicide. The person writing the post is not expressing any suicidal thoughts, desires, plans, or past attempts for themselves.
    - The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"".
    - The definition of 'Indicator' is: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life."" While the words ""kill themselves"" are present, they are not an *expression concerning suicide from the poster themselves*. The poster is merely discussing the topic as an observer/commentator.
    - Therefore, the post does not indicate any personal suicide risk for the individual who wrote it. It fits the 'Indicator' category as it's a general discussion without personal suicidal intent.

    - Specific plans: None mentioned for a *current* act.
    - Past concrete actions: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed."" This clearly describes past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""kill myself"" and clear expressions of wanting to die (""No point in existing,"" ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""Im so tired of being alive""). This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a desire to ""be brave enough to kill myself,"" which is current ideation. However, it does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for a *current* suicide act. It only refers to past attempts. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' based on a *current* plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed."" This phrase indicates that concrete actions were taken in the past with suicidal intent, even if the specific method isn't detailed. The definition of 'Attempt' includes examples like ""I overdosed last year"" or ""when I tried to cut my wrists,"" implying that ""tried"" in this context signifies a concrete action. The rule also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" This post fits this criteria perfectly, as it has current suicidal ideation (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"") and describes past concrete attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal language and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It expresses current suicidal thoughts (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself""), which aligns with 'Ideation'.
    - However, it also explicitly states ""the past two times ive tried ive failed,"" which describes past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - According to the 'Attempt' definition, if a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide (or current ideation, as is the case here), it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. The presence of past concrete attempts takes precedence over current ideation without a specific plan.

    - Since there are no elements of a plan, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. It does not describe what they *did*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""killing myself"") and a clear desire to not be alive (""I don't want to be alive"").
    - There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation).
    - There is no description of a past concrete action.
    - Based on the definitions, this fits 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like 'suicide,' 'kill myself') OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""My desire to kill myself has not."" It also discusses ""Killing myself is painful."" Most importantly, it clearly states, ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months."" It also mentions ""getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys intense hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, and a sense of futility: ""what reason is there to live,"" ""what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands,"" ""it's meant literally nothing,"" ""hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder,"" ""shit just gets more fucked up,"" ""Why bother? Why try?"", ""I don't care anymore,"" ""I just want out.""
    *   **Specific plans:** The phrase ""getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape"" mentions a method, but it's presented as a hypothetical choice (""I'd honestly choose that at this point"") rather than a concrete, immediate plan. The focus is more on the desire to escape by any means.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts: ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months."" This provides specific details (method: overdose, frequency/timeframe: twice in two weeks, three times in six months).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and a clear desire to die (""I just want out... if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that""). This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   While ""getting hit by an incoming train"" mentions a method, it's phrased as a desperate, hypothetical choice for escape rather than a concrete plan the user is actively forming or preparing for. The primary focus of the post regarding actions is on past attempts. Given the strong presence of past attempts, this hypothetical future method is less defining than the described past actions.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post contains a clear description of specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months."" This directly fulfills the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation (""desire to kill myself"").
    *   It explicitly describes multiple past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide (""I've attempted an overdose..."").
    *   According to the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life... Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" Even if the ""train"" comment were interpreted as a current plan, the explicit description of past attempts makes 'Attempt' the correct classification. The detailed account of past overdoses is the most definitive element for classification.

My parents would rub in my face about how they were right about me not eating causing me severe issues later on, I'm also scared of being seen weak around them. Please I'm so fucking scared.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No direct mentions.
    - Emotional indicators: ""very worried,"" ""fucking horrified,"" ""keep crying,"" ""having panic attacks,"" ""can't live without estrogen,"" ""too much,"" ""I'm going insane,"" ""so fucking scared."" These indicate extreme distress, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed.
    - Specific plans: None. No method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" expresses a strong dependency and distress about a particular life circumstance, but it is not a direct statement of wanting to die or cease existing in a suicidal context. The post is primarily focused on intense anxiety and fear about a potential health issue and parental reaction.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No description of a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant distress, fear, anxiety, and feelings of being overwhelmed (""too much,"" ""going insane,"" ""so fucking scared"").
    - However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a clear, unambiguous desire to die or end one's life. The distress is related to a perceived health crisis and social fears, not a direct wish for self-annihilation.
    - According to the definitions, if there is no explicit suicide term AND no other clear desire to die expressed, the post is likely 'Indicator'. The post fits the 'Indicator' definition as it shows general distress and feeling overwhelmed, but not a clear desire to die or suicidal ideation.

22,There is NO hope left. I've been on medication after medication. I've done biofeedback. I went to therapy twice a week for 4 years. I did EMDR. I had 27 sessions of TMS that did NOTHING. There is no way I can afford Ketamine. I live on $786 a month and some days don't even eat. So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more. Now it's time to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Now it's time to end it"" is a direct expression of intent to end life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""NO hope left,"" ""did NOTHING"" (referring to treatments), ""don't even eat"" due to financial hardship. These clearly indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and distress.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or timeframe for the *current* intent is mentioned. ""Now it's time to end it"" indicates immediacy but not a specific plan element.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" This refers to past actions taken to end their life. However, it does *not* describe *what* they tried (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut myself""). It's a general statement about having made multiple attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The phrase ""Now it's time to end it"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to end one's life. (Yes)
    - Therefore, it is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on the suicidal intent, does the post mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation for the *current* act?
    - No. ""Now it's time to end it"" expresses intent but lacks any details about *how* or *where*. It does not specify a method, means, location, or preparation. The timeframe ""now"" is present, but without a method or means, it doesn't constitute a 'plan' as strictly defined for 'Behavior' (which requires one or more of method, means, location, specific timeframe *for the act*, tools/weapons, substances, or preparation). The definition states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan (containing at least one of the elements above), choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Given the lack of method/means/location, this would not be 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a *specific past concrete action* the poster took to try to end their life?
    - The phrases ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" refer to past attempts. However, the definition for 'Attempt' states: ""Vague references (e.g., 'I've tried before,' 'my past attempts,' 'I've been suicidal for years and almost did it') without describing the actual action are NOT sufficient for 'Attempt'. It must be a description of what they *did*.""
    - The post does not describe *what* the person did (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). It is a vague reference to past actions. Therefore, it does not meet the strict criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to end life (""Now it's time to end it""), so it is not 'Indicator'.
    - It does not include a specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe for the act with details, or preparations) for the current intent, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - While it refers to past attempts, these references are vague and do not describe a ""specific past concrete action"" as required by the 'Attempt' definition.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation', as it expresses a clear desire to not be alive any longer (""Now it's time to end it"") but without a specific plan for the current intent and without describing a specific past concrete action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Society doesn't like me,"" ""People bully me,"" ""don't feel comfortable,"" ""something is wrong with me,"" ""nothing fills the hole in my heart,"" ""I feel lonely,"" ""I feel like I am only watching other living human beings,"" ""I feel like I am on the moon,"" ""unconnected with this world,"" ""I feel like a creature."" These indicate feelings of worthlessness, isolation, despair, and profound unhappiness.
    - Specific plans: There are no mentions of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: There are no descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. The phrase ""In the pas I tried to hide this with saying 'I am misanthrope'"" refers to a past coping mechanism for feelings, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, the post states, ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, the explicit mention of ""thinking about suicide"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation.
    - Since there is an explicit mention of ""suicide,"" this post is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location being considered for suicide? No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There are no elements of a plan present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post describes past feelings and coping mechanisms (""In the pas I tried to hide this with saying 'I am misanthrope'""), but not a concrete action of a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday,"" which clearly indicates suicidal thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post does not contain any specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action of attempting suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, based on the definition, the post fits 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""thinking about suicide everyday"") but without any specific plan to commit suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""What's the use."", ""I've given up in life"", ""I'm not scared to die"", ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""What's the use,"" ""I've given up in life,"" ""For some life may end up getting better but for me it doesn't.""), despair.
    *   **Specific plans:** ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" This includes a preparation (""note"") and a specific timeframe (""early April"").
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** No past concrete actions related to suicide attempts are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post does not use ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" explicitly.
    *   However, it contains unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or cease existing: ""I've given up in life,"" ""I'm not scared to die,"" and the explicit mention of ""a plan, note and date"" which, in context, clearly refers to ending life. This indicates a clear desire to die.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post mentions a plan. Specifically:
        *   **Means/Preparation:** ""note"" (implying a suicide note).
        *   **Timeframe:** ""early April"".
    *   The presence of a specific timeframe and preparation (note) fulfills the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die and has explicit elements of a plan (a specific timeframe ""early April"" and a preparation ""note"").
    *   This fits the definition of 'Behavior' perfectly, as it includes both the desire to die and specific elements of a plan (timeframe, preparation/means).
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because there's a clear desire to die.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because there are specific elements of a plan.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.

That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""kill myself,"" ""cuts I have all over myself"" (self-harm), ""end up dead in a gutter,"" ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""too much recently,"" ""anger is worse than ever,"" ""rabid dog,"" ""constantly on edge,"" ""ready to explode,"" ""no family anyway so no one would care or miss me,"" ""I don't care."" (Hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, anhedonia, intense distress, anger).
    *   **Specific plans:** The post presents a dilemma: ""it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself."" Crucially, the poster states, ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet."" This explicitly indicates a lack of a decided, concrete plan for suicide. While ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye"" is a strong indicator of intent, it lacks a specific method, means, location, or definite timeframe. The ""probably"" and ""still debating"" dilute the certainty of a firm plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""given how many cuts I have all over myself."" This describes self-harm, but it does not explicitly state that these cuts were a *suicide attempt* (i.e., intended to end life). It's a description of current or past injury, not a specific past action taken to try to end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself"" multiple times, and a clear desire to not be alive (""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."").
    *   This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post mention:
        *   A specific **method**? No (e.g., no mention of pills, jumping, etc.).
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed? No (e.g., no mention of having pills ready, buying a gun, writing a note *for suicide*).
        *   A specific **location**? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**? No. The ""last post ever"" is a strong expression of intent but not a specific timeframe for the *act* itself, especially given the ""still debating"" statement.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? ""My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" This is a strong sign, but the explicit statement ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet"" indicates that a *firm, decided plan* is not yet in place. The definition of Behavior requires a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation). While ""goodbye"" can be preparation, the explicit ""debating"" and lack of other specific plan elements make it ambiguous for 'Behavior'. The guideline states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan (containing at least one of the elements above), choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Given the explicit ""debating"" and lack of method/means/location/timeframe, I am unsure if it meets the strict 'Behavior' criteria.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life?
    *   ""given how many cuts I have all over myself."" This describes self-harm, but it does not specify that these cuts were an *attempt to end life*. It does not meet the definition of 'Attempt' which requires a description of a specific past concrete action taken *to try to end their life*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a specific past concrete suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   While there is strong suicidal intent and a concerning ""goodbye,"" the post explicitly states the person is ""still debating"" and ""haven't even left home yet."" This indicates the *absence* of a decided, concrete plan with a specific method, means, location, or definite timeframe. The choice is presented as a dilemma between seeking help and suicide, with no firm decision made. Therefore, it falls under 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear desire to die and suicidal thoughts, but without a specific, decided plan as required for 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I can't kill myself"", ""Im suicidal"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""Im so tired"", ""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point"", ""i don't believe it, maybe its my brain playing with me."" (Fatigue, worthlessness, despair, self-doubt).
    - Specific plans: ""I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there"". This describes a specific location and implies a method (jumping). The statement ""its possible to get there"" indicates consideration of feasibility.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""Im suicidal"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific **method**: Implied (jumping from a cliff).
        - A specific **location**: ""I know a good clif"". Yes.
        - The post also notes the distance (""around 4-5km"") and feasibility (""its possible to get there""), indicating specific consideration of this location for the act.
    - While the poster states ""i just can't commit to it"", the *identification* of a specific location and its accessibility for the purpose of suicide constitutes a plan element as per the 'Behavior' definition (specific location being considered for suicide).

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""kill myself"", ""suicidal""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - The post goes beyond mere ideation by identifying a specific location (""a good clif"") and noting its accessibility (""its possible to get there"") for the purpose of suicide. This falls under the 'Behavior' definition which includes ""specific locations being considered for suicide"" as part of a plan. Even though the poster expresses difficulty committing to it, the *identification* and *consideration* of a specific location for suicide is a key element of a plan.

    - Emotional indicators: The post is saturated with expressions of extreme distress, hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and exhaustion: ""tired of everything,"" ""tired of feeling this way,"" ""tired of my life,"" ""tired of hating myself,"" ""tired of crying myself to sleep,"" ""tired of being afraid,"" ""tired of feeling disgusting,"" ""tired of remembering all of the mean shit,"" ""tired of being ugly,"" ""tired of asking myself why my life is like this everyday,"" ""tired of not having friends,"" ""I have nothing going for me in my life.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""I just want it all to stop"" in the context of overwhelming distress and ""I wish I was never born"" are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to cease existing or not be alive. This fits the 'Ideation' definition's examples like ""I want it to be over"" or ""I wish I could disappear.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.

    - Since no elements of a specific plan are present, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There is no description of an action like ""I overdosed"" or ""I tried to cut myself.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to not be alive anymore (""I just want it all to stop,"" ""I wish I was never born"") which goes beyond general distress and fits the 'Ideation' definition.
    - It does not contain any specific plan elements (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - It is more than 'Indicator' because it expresses a clear desire to cease existing/not be alive, which the 'Indicator' definition explicitly states should be classified as 'Ideation'.

Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

28,"Depressed. This month has already been a shit show, texted my mom I think I need to be on anti depressants and she just said 'schedule a doctors appointment' not 'are you okay? Do you want to talk?' I can't wait to fucking kill myself and have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral. It's gonna be one last big fuck you",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself."" This is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Depressed,"" ""shit show,"" ""fake ass friends and shitty family."" Indicates hopelessness, despair, anger, and feelings of worthlessness/lack of support.
    - Specific plans: No specific method (how), means (what tools/substances), location (where), or specific timeframe (when, e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"") is mentioned. The phrase ""It's gonna be one last big fuck you"" describes the *intended outcome/message* of the act, not a plan for carrying it out.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, implied by the above.
    - Since there is an explicit mention of ""kill myself,"" the post is beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No. ""I can't wait"" expresses impatience but is not a specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""on my birthday.""
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since none of these elements of a specific plan are present, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post is about current feelings and future intent, not a historical attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"") and a clear desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation) mentioned, which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life without detailing a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end it all"", ""goodbye everybody"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""no one really understands"", ""I doubt anyone will care"" (hopelessness, isolation).
    - Specific plans: ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks"" (specific timeframe), ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" (implies a method is known). ""So goodbye everybody"" (preparation/farewell).
    - Past concrete actions: ""all ready tried that before"" refers to trying to tell someone, not a past suicide attempt. It does not describe a concrete action of self-harm or attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, ""end it all"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die/cease existing. ""So goodbye everybody"" also indicates a clear intent to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, suicidal intent is present.
    - Specific timeframe: ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks"" - YES.
    - Specific method: ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" - while the method isn't stated, the *knowledge* of the method, combined with the timeframe and farewell, points to a plan.
    - Preparation: ""So goodbye everybody"" - YES, this is a clear sign of preparation/farewell.
    - Based on the presence of a specific timeframe and clear preparation, this fits the 'Behavior' definition.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""all ready tried that before"" refers to trying to communicate, not a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die (""end it all"").
    - It includes a specific timeframe (""a few weeks"") and clear signs of preparation/farewell (""So goodbye everybody""). It also states the poster knows ""how I'm gonna do it,"" implying a method is in mind.
    - These elements align directly with the definition of 'Behavior' (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a plan including a specific timeframe and preparations).
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - It's beyond 'Ideation' because of the specific timeframe and preparations.

I'm everything wrong with the world! My existence screws up everyone's lives I've ever come in contact with! I can't even fucking kill my self. I hold the blade but can't fucking do it for what! I should be able to!. It'd be better off for everyone if I did it. I try so hard to be only good and radiate happiness but my past is still there. I'm still just a burden. I can be as kind as I want but they'll always see me the way I am. Nothing.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I can't even fucking kill my self."" ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it."" ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""burden,"" ""disappointment,"" ""hate me,"" ""everything wrong with the world,"" ""screws up everyone's lives,"" ""Nothing."" (Strong feelings of worthlessness, self-loathing, hopelessness, despair).
    *   **Specific plans:** The post mentions ""I hold the blade,"" which is a means. However, it immediately follows with ""but can't fucking do it."" This explicitly states an *inability* to execute the act, rather than a plan to do so. There's no specific timeframe, location, or other preparations mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The phrase ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" describes a struggle or an *inaction*, not a past concrete attempt. It indicates the person *has not* acted despite having the means and desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and a clear desire to die (""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it""). This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post mentions ""the blade"" as a potential means. However, the critical phrase is ""but can't fucking do it."" This directly contradicts the idea of an active plan to commit suicide. While the means (blade) are present and the desire to die is strong, the explicit statement of *inability* to carry out the act means there is no *executable plan* as defined for 'Behavior'. The person is expressing frustration at their inability to act, not stating a plan they are going to execute. If a plan exists, it must be something the person intends or is preparing to do, not something they explicitly state they cannot do.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life. ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" is about a current or recurring struggle with the *act* of self-harm/suicide, not a description of a past attempt that occurred.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal language and desire to die.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.
    *   The crucial distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. While the post expresses strong suicidal thoughts and desire, and even mentions a means (""the blade""), the explicit statement ""but can't fucking do it"" indicates a lack of an *executable plan*. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a plan to *commit* suicide, implying intent to carry it out. Here, the intent to carry it out is explicitly stated as *not possible* by the poster. Therefore, it falls under 'Ideation' because of the strong suicidal thoughts and desire, but without a clear, active, or executable plan.

If there's anything i learned about life, it's this. Seems my family doesn't like a depressed 16 year old, but doesn't even deal with him. Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?. People love plastic, and people love plastic people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"" is a direct, albeit rhetorical, expression of wanting to die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""depressed 16 year old,"" ""stripping yourself of individuality,"" ""People love plastic, and people love plastic people"" indicate feelings of despair, worthlessness, lack of acceptance, and general unhappiness.
    - Specific plans: No mention of method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    - Conclusion: Since there is a clear desire to die expressed, it is not 'Indicator'. Proceed to analyze for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Conclusion: There is no specific plan identified. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There is no mention of ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists,"" etc.
    - Conclusion: It is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die (""how about i die then"").
    - It does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation).
    - It does not describe any specific past concrete actions of a suicide attempt.
    - Based on the definitions, 'Ideation' is the best fit: ""The content includes... a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself will happen,"" ""taking my own life,"" ""will not live to see my 40th birthday.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""no hope,"" ""all is lost,"" ""pointless,"" ""meaningless,"" ""waste of energy to even keep trying.""
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: Not explicitly stated.
        - Means: Not explicitly stated.
        - Location: Not explicitly stated.
        - Specific timeframes: ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)."" This sets a clear upper bound for the timeframe of the suicidal act. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., 'I'll kill myself at 21')"". This fits.
        - Preparations: ""I have this on my computer wallpaper now. It is my daily reminder that killing myself will happen."" This indicates a strong mental commitment but isn't a direct physical preparation for the act itself. However, the statement ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life"" signifies a fixed intent.
    - Past concrete actions: ""At least I DID try."" This is too vague to be considered a description of a ""specific past concrete action"" for an attempt. It could refer to trying to live or cope.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""killing myself"" and ""taking my own life.""
    - Yes, there are unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/not be alive (""I will not live to see my 40th birthday"").
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - The post mentions a specific timeframe: ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)."" This is a definitive future boundary for the act.
    - The post also states ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life,"" which indicates a strong, fixed intent towards carrying out the act within that timeframe.
    - Based on the presence of a specific timeframe, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The phrase ""At least I DID try"" is not a description of a ""specific past concrete action"" to end their life. It's too general and does not meet the strict definition for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal language and desire to die.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no specific past concrete action is described.
    - It expresses clear suicidal thoughts and intent (""killing myself will happen,"" ""taking my own life,"" ""100% confirmed"").
    - Crucially, it includes a specific timeframe for the act/outcome (""will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)""). This meets the criteria for 'Behavior' as defined.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" (used twice).
    - Emotional indicators: ""so so tired,"" ""tired of being criticized and unloved,"" ""worse decision I ever made was staying here."" (indicates hopelessness, despair, regret).
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or *future* timeframe for suicide is mentioned. The reference ""6 month ago"" is to a past opportunity, not a current or future plan.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: The phrase ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down"" explicitly states that the person *did not* take the action, but rather ""talked myself down."" This is a regret about *not* having acted, not a description of a concrete past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and states ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself,"" which is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    - This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, specific *future* timeframe, or preparation? No. The ""6 month ago"" refers to a past *missed opportunity*, not a current plan or a past concrete action. ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"" expresses persistent ideation, not a plan.
    - Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The statement ""I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down"" indicates that they *did not* proceed with the act, despite having an opportunity. It's a regret about *not* attempting, not a description of an actual attempt.
    - Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal language and desire to die.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan (method, means, location, future timeframe, or preparation) mentioned.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because it describes a *missed opportunity* or *regret about not acting* in the past, rather than a concrete action taken to end their life.
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"") without detailing a specific plan or a past concrete attempt. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""too weak,"" ""hurt severely,"" ""stupid ultimatum,"" ""embarrassing myself,"" ""showing how weak I am,"" ""pathetic,"" ""used by everyone I know,"" ""shitty."" These indicate feelings of helplessness, worthlessness, sadness, and being exploited.
    *   **Specific plans:** None. There are no mentions of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post expresses a desire for a difficult situation to change (""I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with,"" ""I just want him to understand how shitty he's being""), and feelings of being weak and pathetic, but not a wish to die or cease existing.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):** Not applicable, as there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:** Not applicable, as there is no description of a specific past concrete action to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post does not contain any explicit mentions of suicide or a clear, unambiguous desire to die. Therefore, it is not 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.
    *   The post does contain general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness (""never gonna happen""), and feelings of worthlessness (""pathetic,"" ""weak"").
    *   This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life.

Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working"" which, despite the ""metaphorically,"" is immediately followed by ""unfortunately,"" hinting at a desire for it to be literal. More directly, ""I just want to not exist"" is a clear expression of wanting to cease living.
    - Emotional indicators: ""hollow,"" ""sadness,"" ""nothing but sadness,"" ""hurts so bad,"" ""I hate this,"" ""suffer through this painful middle ground,"" ""suffer in silence,"" ""God I fucking hate myself."" These indicate severe distress, despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans: No mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide. The wish to ""live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land"" is a desire for escape, not a plan for suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: No descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains ""I just want to not exist,"" which is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to cease existing.
    - The phrase ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself"" also contains the direct phrase ""kill myself,"" and the ""unfortunately"" suggests a desire for it to be literal, even if qualified as metaphorical in context.
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die/cease existing. This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - No specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means (e.g., ""have the pills ready,"" ""bought a gun""), specific location (e.g., ""that tall building""), specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""my 21st birthday""), or clear signs of preparation (e.g., ""writing note,"" ""giving away things"") are mentioned.
    - Conclusion: No elements of a specific plan are identified.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life (e.g., ""I overdosed last year,"" ""when I tried to cut my wrists"").
    - Conclusion: Not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to ""not exist"" and significant emotional distress and self-hatred (""God I fucking hate myself""). This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition: ""a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan mentioned.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as no past concrete action is described.
    - It is stronger than 'Indicator' due to the explicit desire to ""not exist"" and the strong emotional indicators of wanting to cease living.

Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

The phrase ""someone please murder me becasue i dont have the balls to take my own life"" expresses a strong desire for death, even if not self-inflicted, it's within the context of suicidal ideation due to the following phrase.
    - Emotional indicators: ""losing my mind"", ""complete breakdown"", ""hate myself"", ""hate my brain"", ""can't take it anymore"", ""tired of being alone"", ""tired of feeling worthless"", ""tired of failing everything"".
    - Specific plans: ""put a bullet right through it"" mentions a specific method (bullet) and target (brain). This is a specific method.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, the post mentions a specific method: ""put a bullet right through it"". This clearly describes a method for suicide, which is a key element for the 'Behavior' category.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

    - Emotional indicators: ""too scared,"" ""don't want to die in pain,"" ""don't want to make my mother sad,"" ""can't keep doing this it's too much,"" ""too painful,"" ""loathe myself,"" ""sad.""
    - Specific plans: ""i could take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep"" - this indicates a specific method (""take a bunch of pills"") and a specific timeframe (""while everyones asleep"").
    - Past concrete actions: No descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""suicide watch"" and ""wish i could just fucking end it.""
    - Yes, there are other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die: ""wasn't made for life,"" ""better if i was dead.""
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: Yes, ""take a bunch of pills.""
        - Specific means: Implied availability of ""pills.""
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: Yes, ""while everyones asleep.""
        - Clear signs of preparation: No explicit preparation, but the thought of a specific action at a specific time is a plan element.
    - Since there is a specific method and a specific timeframe, this fits the criteria for 'Behavior'. The hesitation (""too scared"") does not negate the presence of these plan elements.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It discusses current thoughts and a potential future action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and suicidal thoughts (""suicide watch,"" ""wish i could just fucking end it,"" ""better if i was dead"").
    - It also includes elements of a specific plan: a method (""take a bunch of pills"") and a timeframe (""while everyones asleep"").
    - There is no description of a past concrete attempt.
    - Therefore, it best fits the 'Behavior' category.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The poster explicitly states, ""I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life,"" ""haven't had suicidal ideation in months,"" and ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" They also refer to ""how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets)."" There are also mentions of a friend's suicidal thoughts/plans, but the classification is only for the poster.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The poster mentions their own past struggles with ""stress, anxiety, and depression"" but states they are ""in a good place now.""
    *   **Specific plans:** The poster *does not* mention any current specific plans for *themselves*. The plans mentioned are for their friend.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The poster clearly describes a past concrete action: ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" They also reiterate this by saying ""I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets"" regarding their attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation,"" ""attempt,"" and ""try to commit suicide,"" referring to the poster's past.
    *   However, the poster explicitly states they are currently ""in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months."" So, there is no *current* clear desire to die expressed by the poster.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   No, the post does not mention any current specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) for the *poster* to commit suicide. The poster explicitly states they are not currently suicidal.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life: ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" This is a clear, concrete description of a past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The core of the post, regarding the *poster's* own risk, is the detailed description of a ""very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded.""
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' is: ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life...""
    *   Even though the poster states they are currently in a good place and not having ideation, the explicit description of a past concrete attempt fits the 'Attempt' category perfectly. The rules state: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" While there are no *current* plans for the poster, the explicit description of a past attempt is sufficient for this classification.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because there are explicit mentions of past suicidal ideation and a concrete attempt.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because a concrete past action (an attempt) is described, which is a higher level of risk classification when present.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because there is no *current* plan described for the poster.
    *   Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification based on the presence of a described past concrete action.

39,"I'm scared therapy wont work. My parents realized 'omg hey our kid isn't really doing all that well' and now I'm going to therapy. Which is good. But I worry therapy won't work. Even on days where I'm actually happy I still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts. And it's tempting a lot of the time. I'm tired of always being afraid and upset over little things, I'm tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation. I wish I could be so much better than I am so I didn't live every moment in shame. Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" is a slang reference to suicidal thoughts/suicide. The phrase ""And it's tempting a lot of the time"" indicates a desire or inclination towards these thoughts.
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""worry,"" ""tired of always being afraid and upset,"" ""tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation,"" ""live every moment in shame."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and self-worth issues.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" is a direct, albeit informal/slang, reference to suicidal thoughts.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? The phrase ""And it's tempting a lot of the time"" in the context of ""sewer slide thoughts"" clearly indicates a desire or strong inclination towards ending one's life.
    - Since 'Yes' to the above, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There are no elements of a specific plan present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post refers to ongoing thoughts and temptation, not a past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"") and a clear desire/temptation to act on them (""And it's tempting a lot of the time""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan.

But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it?

    - Emotional indicators: ""I hate myself so much"", ""I'm terrible"", ""awful"", ""disgusting and pathetic"", ""sad and stupid"", ""humiliates me so deeply"", ""fucked in the head"", ""coward"". These indicate severe distress, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train"" (specific method: jumping, specific means: train).
        - Means: The contemplation of ""end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" suggests thinking about preparations, even if not yet acquired or executed.
        - Location: ""in front of a train"" (specific location).
        - Timeframes: No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"", ""tomorrow"").
        - Preparations: ""don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" indicates active consideration of practical steps for suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly states ""makes me want to kill myself"" and ""I want to kill myself so badly."" It also expresses a clear desire to die/not exist (""I hate being alive,"" ""shouldn't exist,"" ""I wish I was never born""). This means it's beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post includes a clear desire to die/suicidal intent.
    - It also mentions a specific method (""jump in front of a train"") and a specific location (""in front of a train"").
    - The phrase ""don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" indicates contemplation of preparations for the act, which falls under planning. The user is actively thinking about the practicalities of ending their life.
    - The statement ""It's looking pretty good but I'm a coward"" suggests the plan is being seriously considered.
    - These elements are sufficient to classify it as 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. It focuses on current ideation and contemplation of a future act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself so badly""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond just thoughts by mentioning a specific method (""jump in front of a train"") and location (""in front of a train""), and contemplating practical preparations (""end of life stuff""). This moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category as it contains explicit suicidal ideation combined with elements of a specific plan (method, location, and contemplation of preparations).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses suicidal intent (""I want to kill myself"") but does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""slitting my wrists"" (a specific method of self-harm/suicide).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""confinement mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" ""feeling more alone."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post states ""i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it."" This indicates a thought of a method, but explicitly states no action was taken and no current plan is being enacted or prepared for. There's no mention of acquiring means, specific location, or specific timeframe for a future act.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** The phrase ""but i didnt do it"" explicitly negates any past concrete action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**

    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? The thought of ""slitting my wrists"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of a suicidal thought, considering a method to end one's life. This moves beyond general distress and indicates suicidal ideation. So, Yes, there is a clear suicidal thought.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    *   Does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? It mentions a specific method (""slitting my wrists"").
    *   However, the crucial part is ""but i didnt do it."" This indicates that while the method was *thought about*, it was *not* part of an active plan being prepared for or carried out. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide"" (meaning current intent/preparation), or ""exhibits self-harming behavior intended to lead to suicide."" The post explicitly states the opposite of action/preparation. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' because the thought of the method was not translated into a plan or action.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post explicitly states ""but i didnt did it,"" confirming no action was taken.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no concrete action was taken (""but i didnt do it"").
    *   It's not 'Behavior' because, while a method was considered, the post explicitly states it was a thought that was *not* acted upon or developed into a current plan (no means acquired, no timeframe set, no preparations). The thought of the method is present, but the *absence of a plan being put into action or prepared for* means it falls short of 'Behavior'.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""the suicidal feelings are coming back.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""ashamed,"" ""depressed,"" ""paying the price,"" ""constant pain,"" ""hurts to eat."" These indicate significant distress, shame, and physical pain linked to past depression.
    - Specific plans: No mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. ""Suicidal feelings are coming back"" implies past ideation, but not a past attempt (a concrete action).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains an explicit mention of ""suicidal feelings."" This is sufficient to move beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post mentions ""suicidal feelings"" (indicating suicidal intent/desire to die).
    - However, it does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal feelings,"" which means it's not 'Indicator' (as 'Indicator' lacks explicit expression concerning suicide or a clear desire to die).
    - It expresses suicidal thoughts/feelings (""suicidal feelings are coming back"") but lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

        - A specific **method**? No.
        - Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent? Yes, asking how to write ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters"" clearly indicates preparation and intent to create these means.

I just hoped I could get some comfort if there was any left with my psych before I end thing v v soon. save some flowers for me please? I like lavender",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicide date"", ""end thing v v soon"", ""didn't die last night"", ""sh/suicidality"", ""constant attempts"" (past), ""enough is enough"", ""save some flowers for me please?"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""worst of this hell"", ""don't trust anymore"", ""TRuST NOT 1 SINGLE soul"", ""trauma/ptsd"", ""fucking done"", ""treat me like shit or are done with me"". Shows extreme distress, hopelessness, and distrust.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Timeframe:** ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it (doubt ill make it that long)."" This is a very specific, near-future timeframe.
        *   **Preparations:** ""save some flowers for me please? I like lavender"" can be interpreted as a final request/preparation.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""8 yrs of constant attempts but obv I wasn't trying hard enough."" This mentions ""constant attempts"" but does *not* describe a specific concrete action (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists""). It's a general statement about past suicidal behavior, not a detailed account of a past attempt. ""only reason I didn't die last night"" implies a very recent near-miss or strong intent, but again, no concrete action is described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide date"" and clear expressions of wanting to die/end life (""end thing v v soon"", ""enough is enough"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions a specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide: ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it"". This meets the criteria for 'Behavior'. The request for flowers can also be seen as a form of preparation/final request.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post mentions ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" and ""only reason I didn't die last night"". However, it does not describe a *specific past concrete action* the poster took to try to end their life (e.g., ""I overdosed on pills,"" ""when I tried to hang myself""). The definition for 'Attempt' requires a description of *what they did*. Therefore, this does not qualify for 'Attempt' based on the strict definition.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and a desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes a specific future timeframe for suicide (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date""), which is a key element of a plan as defined under 'Behavior'.
    *   While past attempts are mentioned, they are not described with enough concrete detail (what the person *did*) to classify as 'Attempt' according to the provided definition. The primary and most urgent element is the stated specific future plan.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

47,"Pointlessness. I know someone's gonna hit me with ""well if everything's pointless, then it doesn't matter if nothing matters"". Which doesn't make things better. It doesn't make me want to go rogue and have fun with life because I've let everything go, and come what may until in my grave I lay. No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey. I don't want to look on the bright-side, to have confidence or assertiveness. I am bad at both those things. If I was good at them, I wouldn't want them. That's my point. If we have an option as humans to be any way we want, I vote we be no way at all. I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds. I am so sick of appearances. People care SO MUCH about how other people are. It's sickening. I should start being rude to people, in line with how I feel about us. I know there's a heaven and it distresses me. I want to disappear forever and I know God won't let that happen. I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit. What's difficult is the pain caused to people I care about and who care about me, but I don't really think it'll matter one way or the other. They'll suffer and that will be that, different and worse than had they not suffered, but just another experience at the end of the day.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""until in my grave I lay"" (passive), ""I want to disappear forever"" (clear desire to cease existing), ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit."" (specific timeframe for self-inflicted death).
    - Emotional indicators: ""Pointlessness,"" ""sick of everybody's fascination,"" ""I don't want to look on the bright-side,"" ""I am bad at both those things,"" ""distresses me,"" ""sickening,"" ""pain caused to people I care about."" - Indicates hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, worthlessness, general distress, and nihilism.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: None.
        - Means: None.
        - Location: None.
        - Specific timeframes: ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit."" This is a specific timeframe for the poster's own death, stated as a certainty and a self-imposed limit. This fits the 'Behavior' definition's example of ""I'll kill myself at 21"".
        - Preparations: None.
    - Past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" terms.
    - However, there is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die/cease existing: ""I want to disappear forever."" Additionally, ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit"" strongly implies a self-determined end to life by that age, in the context of distress and wanting to disappear.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die/cease existing, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - Does the post mention elements of a plan? Yes, a specific timeframe: ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit."" The 'Behavior' definition explicitly includes ""a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., 'I'm ending it tonight,' 'I plan to do it on my birthday,' 'I'll kill myself at 21')"". The statement about dying by 35 fits this perfectly as a self-imposed outer limit for life, indicating a planned end.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die (""I want to disappear forever""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - It contains a clear desire to die AND a specific timeframe for this intended death (""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit.""). This specific timeframe, indicating a planned end to life by a certain age, aligns directly with the definition of 'Behavior' (specifically, the example ""I'll kill myself at 21""). Therefore, it is 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

    - Emotional indicators: Frustration, despair, hopelessness, clear intent to die.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""hanging myself"", ""taking these pills"".
        - Means: ""the shower or the door frame"" (as potential points for hanging), ""these pills"".
        - Location: Implied home (shower, door frame).
        - Timeframe: Not explicitly mentioned.
        - Preparations: Not explicitly mentioned, but the discussion of specific methods and means for the purpose of dying implies active consideration of a plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""kill yourself"", ""hanging myself"", and a clear desire to die (""I'm trying to die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, the post mentions specific methods (""hanging myself"", ""taking these pills"") and specific means (""the shower or the door frame"", ""these pills"") being considered for the purpose of dying. The user is evaluating the efficacy of these methods/means for suicide. This active consideration of specific methods and means, combined with the clear desire to die, constitutes a plan as defined for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (""trying to die""), so it is not 'Indicator'.
    - The post does not describe a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The post goes beyond mere ideation by discussing specific methods (""hanging myself"", ""taking these pills"") and specific means (""the shower or the door frame"", ""these pills"") for suicide, and evaluating their potential effectiveness. This discussion of *how* to die, even with doubts about success, fits the definition of 'Behavior' because it includes elements of a specific plan (method, means).

    - Emotional indicators: ""fucking depressed"", ""numb"", ""sick of everything"", ""can't even think straight"", ""scared of messing it up"".
    - Specific plans: The post explicitly states ""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"" and ""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up."" This indicates the *absence* of a specific plan.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""I want to die"" and mentions ""killing myself"". This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post explicitly states ""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"". It also says ""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up."" This directly negates the presence of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die"") and mentions suicidal thoughts (""specific plan for killing myself"" in the context of *not* having one). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - Crucially, the post explicitly states the *absence* of a specific plan (""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself""). This is the defining characteristic that differentiates 'Ideation' from 'Behavior'.
    - There are no descriptions of past concrete actions.
    - Based on the definitions, the content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/a clear desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan. This perfectly matches the 'Ideation' definition.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" in the context of ""counting my pills"" strongly implies a contemplation of overdose/suicide by pills.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""nobody loves or cares for me""), worthlessness (""why am i such a coward"").
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   Method: Taking ""all"" the ""pills"" (implied overdose).
        *   Means: ""my pills"" (implies possession). The act of ""counting my pills"" every night indicates active engagement with and possession of the means.
        *   Location: Not specified.
        *   Timeframes: ""every night"" (counting), ""every day"" (wondering why not). While not a future timeframe for the act itself, this describes a recurring, active engagement with the means and method.
        *   Preparations: ""counting my pills"" every night can be interpreted as a form of preparation or active engagement with the means for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" refers to a past *inaction* and current contemplation, not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" clearly expresses a desire to have ended their life, especially in the context of feeling unloved and uncared for. This is an unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    *   *Decision:* Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present).
    *   Does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**: Yes, ""take them all"" (referring to pills) implies an overdose.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: Yes, ""my pills"" are possessed, and the act of ""counting my pills"" every night shows active engagement with these means with suicidal intent.
        *   A specific **location**: No.
        *   A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide: Not a future timeframe for the act, but the ""every night"" and ""every day"" indicates a current, ongoing engagement with the means and method.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: ""counting my pills"" every night is a clear sign of engagement with the means, which can be considered a form of preparation or active contemplation involving the means.
    *   *Decision:* The post clearly identifies a specific method (taking all pills) and specific means (possessed pills, actively counted). This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition, specifically regarding ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent"" and ""substances... with clear intent for suicide.""

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" is a reflection on not having acted, not a description of an action that occurred.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (""wonder why i didnt take them all"" in a context of despair), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a specific past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation because it involves specific means (""my pills"") and a specific method (taking them all), and there's active engagement with these means (""counting my pills every night""). This active engagement with the means and method, coupled with suicidal intent, fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No direct or indirect mentions of these terms.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""unbearably strong thoughts,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me,"" ""I honestly don't know what to do at this rate."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a struggle with daily life.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of method, means, location, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. ""end up in the psych ward again"" indicates past mental health hospitalization, but not a suicide attempt.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   It *lacks* any explicit mention of suicide or a clear, unambiguous desire to die. The language focuses on the difficulty of living and coping with thoughts, not on a wish to end life.
    *   It *lacks* any elements of a suicide plan.
    *   It *lacks* a description of a past concrete suicide attempt.

    - Emotional indicators: ""depression"", ""don't want to ruin my mum's mental state"".
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""can't continue to live for decades to come"" is about the future duration of life, not a specific timeframe for an act.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""when i off myself"" (a direct phrase for suicide) and ""I don't want to live anymore"", ""can't continue to live for decades to come"" which are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or cease existing.
    - This means the post is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), the post does NOT mention:
        - A specific method.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed.
        - A specific location.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I don't want to live anymore"", ""can't continue to live for decades to come"") and uses explicit suicide-related phrasing (""when i off myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - However, it does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations), which rules out 'Behavior'.

    - Emotional indicators: ""mentally ill,"" ""can't afford treatment,"" ""can't hold work,"" ""health is shit,"" ""what's the fucking point in any of this,"" ""fed up of all this bullshit."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and extreme frustration.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"", ""next week"", a specific date/age like ""at 21""), or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""I know that I'm going to end up getting fed up of all this bullshit and just killing myself"" indicates a strong future intention or perceived inevitability, but not a concrete, actionable plan with details.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:

    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""what's the fucking point in any of this,"" and the overall context of ""what's the point in not [killing myself]"" clearly expresses a desire to cease existing.
    - Since there are explicit suicide terms and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
        - A specific location? No.

        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since none of these elements of planning are present, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit mention of ""killing myself"" and a clear desire to end their life (""what's the fucking point in any of this,"" ""what's the point in not""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - While there is clear suicidal ideation, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations) mentioned. The statement ""I know that I'm going to end up... killing myself"" expresses a strong future intention or perceived inevitability, but it lacks the concrete details required for 'Behavior'.
    - Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan.

    - Yes, the post contains ""kms"" (kill myself), which is an explicit mention of suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - No, the post does not mention a *current* specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide. The action described (""tried to kms yesterday"") is in the past.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life: ""tried to kms yesterday"". This is a direct description of an action taken, not a vague reference.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit mention of suicide (""kms"") and, crucially, describes a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life (""tried to kms yesterday"").
    - According to the definition of 'Attempt', this category applies when ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life"". The phrase ""tried to kms yesterday"" perfectly fits this definition.
    - Even though there's current distress, the defining element for classification is the described past concrete action.

56,There has to be a non painful way to do this. I cant. I absolutely cannot fight anymore. This has been non stop for 28 years. Literally non stop pain and suffering. To the point that I question if I did something horrific in a previous life and it was so bad that I'm still paying for it in this life. I cant. Please. I cant live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""There has to be a non painful way to do this."" (implies ending life), ""I cant live anymore.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I cant."", ""absolutely cannot fight anymore."", ""non stop pain and suffering."", ""despair"", ""hopelessness"".
    - Specific plans: None. The phrase ""a non painful way to do this"" expresses a desire for a method, but not a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly those terms.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""There has to be a non painful way to do this."" clearly implies ending one's life. ""I cant live anymore."" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die/not be alive.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die/not be alive, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present):
        - Specific method: No. ""a non painful way"" is a wish for a method, not a specific one being considered.
        - Specific means: No.
        - Specific location: No.
        - Specific timeframe: No.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - There are no specific elements of a plan present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""I cant live anymore,"" ""There has to be a non painful way to do this""). This makes it more than 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action taken to end their life, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I want to do it next week,"" ""I want to kill myself next week,"" ""write a suicide note."" (Direct language of suicide intent).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, resignation (""my family is upset at first But they are supposed to be remembered anyway"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""I want to kill myself next week"" and ""suicide note,"" clearly expressing a desire to die. This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post mentions a specific method (""with drugs""), a specific timeframe (""next week""), and a clear preparation (""write a suicide note""). These are all elements that define a plan for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. It describes future plans.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die and to commit suicide (""I want to kill myself"").
    *   Crucially, it includes specific elements of a plan: a method (""with drugs""), a timeframe (""next week""), and preparation (""write a suicide note"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""self-harm."" The phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" is present.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""always tired,"" ""so tired,"" ""no motivation,"" ""tired of being sick,"" ""pushing everyone away,"" ""saying hurtful things,"" ""none of the pills do enough,"" ""tired of working,"" ""so lonely,"" ""jealous."" These indicate significant emotional distress, hopelessness, fatigue, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method, means, location, or concrete timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week,"" a specific date/age). ""Soon"" and ""long overdue"" are vague. No preparations mentioned.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** No description of a past suicide attempt. The mention of ""pills"" refers to medication for an illness, not a suicidal act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. The phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" in the context of overwhelming despair, exhaustion, and loneliness (""I'm always tired,"" ""life is so cyclic,"" ""no motivation,"" ""tired of being sick,"" ""so lonely"") strongly implies a desire to end their suffering and cease existing. This is a clear, albeit indirect, expression of wanting to end their life. It goes beyond mere distress to a readiness for an ending.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    *   Does the post mention a specific method? No.
    *   Specific means? No.
    *   Specific location? No.
    *   Specific timeframe? ""Soon"" and ""long overdue"" are not specific enough to meet the criteria for a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my 21st birthday"").
    *   Clear signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there are no specific elements of a plan as defined for 'Behavior', it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The mention of ""pills"" is in the context of medication for an illness, not a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear desire to end their suffering/life (""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"") in the context of deep despair, which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It expresses this desire without providing any specific details of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not describe any specific past concrete actions of a suicide attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   It does not contain a specific plan as required for 'Behavior'.

Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I have overdosed."" This is a clear description of a self-harm action. ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over."" This expresses a desire to end suffering, which is often linked to suicidal ideation. ""it won't kill me, but it'll punish me.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I regret everything,"" ""I regret it. I also don't,"" ""I just want my suffering to be over,"" ""punish me for being such a nuisance to society,"" ""I'm sorry."" These indicate distress, ambivalence, and self-reproach.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post describes an action that has *already occurred*. ""I have overdosed"" specifies a method (overdose) and means (500mg Zoloft). This is not a future plan, but a completed concrete action.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide:** ""I have overdosed."" This is a direct description of a specific concrete action taken by the poster. The phrase ""I finally went through"" also implies the completion of an action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life.""
    *   There is an unambiguous expression of wanting suffering to end (""I just want my suffering to be over""). While the post states ""I don't want to die,"" the action described (overdose) and the desire for suffering to end are critical. However, the primary focus here is the *action* taken.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   This step is for *future* plans. The post describes an action that *has already happened* (""I have overdosed""). Therefore, it does not fit the 'Behavior' definition of a *current* plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post clearly describes a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life: ""I have overdosed."" This fits the definition of 'Attempt' perfectly, as it details what the person *did* (overdosed on Zoloft). Even if the stated intent was ""punishment"" and not death, an overdose is a concrete action commonly associated with suicide attempts, and the definition covers concrete actions taken to *try* to end life. The post describes a completed action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post details a specific, concrete action already taken by the user: ""I have overdosed."" This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life (e.g., 'I overdosed last year')."" The fact that the user states ""I don't want to die"" or ""it won't kill me"" does not negate the fact that a concrete action (overdose) has been described, which is a common method for suicide attempts and a serious self-harm action. The core of 'Attempt' is the description of the *action* taken.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrases ""I'm doing it,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" ""ready to go,"" and ""I'm ready"" in this context strongly imply suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""so at peace right now,"" ""ready."" This can be a concerning indicator of a decided plan.
    - Specific plans: ""in the near future"" is a specific timeframe. ""I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend and now I think I'm ready to go"" suggests preparation or saying goodbyes.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - However, there are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/end life: ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" ""ready to go,"" ""I'm ready."" These phrases clearly convey intent to end life.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die expressed, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - Does the post mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? Yes, ""in the near future."" This qualifies as a specific timeframe as per the 'Behavior' definition.
        - Clear signs of preparation? Yes, ""I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend and now I think I'm ready to go."" This strongly suggests saying goodbyes or getting affairs in order, which are forms of preparation for suicide.
    - Since both a specific timeframe and signs of preparation are present, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. It focuses on future intent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die/end life (""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go""), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - It includes a clear desire to die AND specific elements of a plan: a timeframe (""in the near future"") and signs of preparation (""spent some good time with my favourite person... ready to go""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""i was suicidal"". This refers to a past state.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses frustration and disbelief (""suck"", ""what the hell"") about a past negative experience with high school counselors when their suicidal feelings were discovered. The phrase ""i cant stop thinking about how"" indicates current rumination or preoccupation with this past event.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific plans (method, means, location, timeframe, preparations) are mentioned for current or future suicide.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** The post mentions ""found out i was suicidal"" but does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, the term ""suicidal"" is explicitly used.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No, the post's current focus is on recounting a past negative experience and expressing frustration about it, not a current desire to die.
    *   *Decision Point:* Since the post contains an explicit suicide term (""suicidal""), according to the instructions, it is *not* 'Indicator'. We must proceed to analyze for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on the presence of a suicide mention (even if past-tense, as per step 2's logic), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide? No. There is no mention of any plan.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. It states ""found out i was suicidal,"" which refers to a past mental state, not a described concrete action of an attempt. Vague references are not sufficient for 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Based on Step 2, the presence of the explicit term ""suicidal"" (even in past tense, referring to a past state that the user ""can't stop thinking about"") means the post cannot be classified as 'Indicator' as it does not ""lack any explicit expression concerning suicide"".
    *   Since it is not 'Behavior' (no plan) and not 'Attempt' (no described concrete action), the only remaining category is 'Ideation'.
    *   The 'Ideation' definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"")."" While ""i was suicidal"" refers to a past state, the current rumination (""i cant stop thinking about how..."") about this past suicidal state and the negative response to it suggests a lingering connection to, or preoccupation with, suicidal feelings or experiences, which aligns with ""suicidal thoughts or feelings"" being present in some form, even if not active intent.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""trash,"" ""rubbish sucking at everything,"" ""I hate my family,"" ""no friends,"" ""so sensitive,"" ""suffer from u?"" (worthlessness, self-loathing, despair, anger, hopelessness).

    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of a past concrete action (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""i should die"" and ""kill myself,"" which are direct expressions of wanting to die or commit suicide.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    *   The post explicitly states, ""tho I have prepared everything."" This is a clear indication of *preparation*, which is one of the defining elements for 'Behavior' (as per the definition: ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent,"" ""getting my affairs in order"" are examples of preparation). While no specific method or timeframe is given, the statement of having ""prepared everything"" is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything"" describes current intent and preparation, not a past attempt that was carried out.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""i should die,"" ""kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, it states ""tho I have prepared everything."" This direct mention of preparation for suicide places it beyond mere 'Ideation' and squarely into 'Behavior', as per the definition of 'Behavior' which includes ""preparations"" or ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Vanishing without a trace,"" ""find a secluded spot where no one will find my body,"" ""Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol,"" ""put 2 and 2 together"" (implying suicide).
    - Emotional indicators: ""nothing to look forward to,"" ""never seemed to enjoy my company,"" ""tired of my presence."" (Hopelessness, feeling unwanted, despair).
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol"" (implies using the pistol for suicide).
        - Means: ""Empty my bank account,"" ""leave most of my belongings to them,"" ""No phone or car to trace me, just cash and a pair of shoes,"" ""a pistol.""
        - Location: ""secluded spot where no one will find my body.""

        - Preparations: ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them,"" ""No phone or car to trace me.""
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - However, there are unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/cease existing: ""Vanishing without a trace,"" ""Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body. Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol."" The context clearly indicates a desire to end life.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, the post mentions:
        - A specific method: ""a pistol"" (implied use for suicide).
        - Specific means: ""Empty my bank account,"" ""leave most of my belongings,"" ""a pistol.""
        - A specific location: ""a secluded spot where no one will find my body.""
        - A specific timeframe: ""When that happens [roommates ask to move out]."" This is a conditional but defined future point.
        - Clear signs of preparation: ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them,"" ""No phone or car to trace me.""
    - All these elements strongly indicate 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die"", ""fake it till we die"", ""i give up now"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""tired"", ""life is shit"", ""scary"", ""no one cares"", ""I don't recognise myself anymore"", ""fuck the mental health system"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, and severe distress.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I want to die"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die. ""i give up now"" also points to a desire to cease living.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): Yes, ""I want to die"" indicates suicidal intent.
    - Does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No. There is no mention of how, where, or when the poster intends to die, nor any preparations.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There are no descriptions of actions like ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to cut,"" etc.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die (""I want to die"", ""i give up now""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post does not describe any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the definitions, the post fits 'Ideation' because it includes a clear desire to not be alive any longer (""I want to die"") but without any specific plan.

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years"" (direct mention of suicidal state).
        *   ""I know many people will blame themselves when i do do it"" (implies future suicide).
        *   ""i dont want the existance ive got"" (clear desire to cease existing).
        *   ""making it easier to do something"" (refers to suicide).
        *   ""i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while"" (planning related to death).
        *   ""Ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it"" (specific location for suicide).
        *   ""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police"" (preparation for suicide/discovery).
        *   ""I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge"" (implies imminent suicide).
        *   ""I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face"" (past self-harm, but not explicitly stated as an attempt to end life).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""no one cares right now,"" ""feel so disconected,"" ""rotting away""), despair, feeling worthless (""bring the mood down""), anhedonia (""I just feel so disconected"").
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method:** Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""hanging,"" ""overdose"").
        *   **Means:** Explicitly states ""although ive not gone and got a rope,"" so no means acquired.
        *   **Location:** YES, ""Ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it"".
        *   **Timeframes:** No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
        *   **Preparations:** YES, ""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police."" This is a clear preparation for the aftermath.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide:** The post mentions ""self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face"" as a child. However, this is described as ""acting out"" and ""violent child"" behavior, not explicitly as an action taken *to try to end their life*. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life."" This description does not meet that strict criterion.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal"" and clear expressions of wanting to die/end existence (""I know many people will blame themselves when i do do it,"" ""i dont want the existance ive got"").
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post mentions a specific **location** for suicide (""the woodland where i would do it"").
    *   The post mentions clear **preparation** (""leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers... and to call the police"").
    *   These elements (specific location and preparation) are sufficient to classify it as 'Behavior' according to the definition.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post describes past self-harm (""scratch and punch my self in the face"").
    *   However, this is presented as a childhood behavioral issue (""acted out,"" ""violent child"") and not as a ""specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life."" It does not meet the strict definition for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (ruling out 'Indicator').
    *   It contains specific elements of a plan: a chosen location (""the woodland where i would do it"") and preparations (""leave notes on the paths... to call the police""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   While past self-harm is mentioned, it is not described as a past *attempt to end life*, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

Final determination is 'Behavior' due to the presence of clear suicidal ideation combined with a specific location and preparation for the act.

I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore . I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I wanna off myself,"" ""I don't even wanna live anymore.""
    - Emotional indicators: Frustration, anger, despair, hopelessness (""sick and tired,"" ""hate my life,"" ""complete bullshit,"" ""fucking hate my mom"").
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""I wanna off myself"" (explicit suicide mention) and ""I don't even wanna live anymore"" (clear desire to not be alive). This means it's not 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal"", ""tonight's the night I guess"", ""when I'm gone"", ""help me stay alive"", ""No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""desperate"", ""hopeless"", ""No one in my life cares"", ""I have no one to talk to"", ""I have no one to help me stay alive"".
    - Specific plans: ""tonight's the night I guess"" indicates a specific timeframe.
    - Past concrete actions: No descriptions of past concrete actions to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""suicidal"" explicitly.
    - Yes, there are other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or cease existing: ""tonight's the night I guess"", ""when I'm gone"".
    - Since there are explicit mentions and clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - The post mentions a specific timeframe: ""tonight's the night I guess"". This directly matches the 'Behavior' definition requirement for a specific timeframe.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. It mentions calling a hotline, but not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""suicidal"") and a desire to die (""tonight's the night I guess"", ""when I'm gone"").
    - Crucially, it includes a specific timeframe (""tonight's the night I guess"") for carrying out the act, which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - It's more than 'Ideation' because of the specific timeframe.

Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""cutting an artery,"" which is a specific, lethal method of self-harm. It also mentions ""oxy"" (Oxycodone), discussing its use to ""lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery."" This directly links a substance to a specific lethal act.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask"" indicates distress and a search for information related to this act, suggesting a serious consideration.
    *   **Specific plans:** Yes, a specific method (""cutting an artery"") and a specific means/substance (""oxy"" to facilitate the act) are discussed. This is a direct inquiry about the execution of a specific suicidal plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No, there is no mention of a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? While not explicitly stating ""I want to die,"" the question ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"" is a clear and unambiguous discussion of how to carry out a lethal act on oneself. The context of seeking advice on making a self-inflicted lethal act less painful strongly implies a desire to die or intent to end one's life. Therefore, yes, there is a clear desire/intent implied through the discussion of specific lethal methods. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method** for suicide? Yes, ""cutting an artery.""
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent? Yes, ""oxy"" is discussed as a means to facilitate the act.
        *   A specific **location**? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**? No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? Discussing the practical aspects of combining oxy with cutting an artery for a less painful death is a form of planning/preparation.

    *   Since a specific method (""cutting an artery"") and a specific substance/means (""oxy"" used with suicidal intent) are explicitly mentioned and discussed in a planning context, this strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post is about a potential future action/plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') because it clearly implies suicidal intent through the discussion of a lethal act.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' as no past concrete action is described.
    *   It's not merely 'Ideation' because it includes a specific method (""cutting an artery"") and discusses specific means (""oxy"") to facilitate that method. The user is asking a practical question about how to execute a specific lethal plan, which fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The presence of a specific method and means moves it from Ideation to Behavior.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains the phrases ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide."" However, these phrases are explicitly attributed to the friend's statements (""my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself,"" ""If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide""). The poster also uses ""die"" in the context of a cancer diagnosis comparison (""If I'd been diagnosed with cancer... would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die""). These are not expressions of the poster's own suicidal intent or desire.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The poster expresses being hurt, upset, feeling like her friend has no faith in her, feeling like a doormat, struggling with mental illness (BPD and CPTSD), and feeling that the friend's words were ""brutal,"" ""thoughtless and hurtful."" There is clear distress.
    *   **Specific plans:** There are no mentions of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations for suicide by the poster.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There are no descriptions of past concrete actions taken by the poster to attempt suicide. The phrase ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"" implies struggle but not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases *from the poster expressing their own intent or desire*? No. While these words appear, they are either direct quotes of what the friend said *about* the poster, or used hypothetically in the context of discussing the friend's words. The poster is not stating ""I want to kill myself"" or ""I am going to commit suicide.""
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing *from the poster*? No. The poster is seeking advice on handling a difficult interpersonal situation and expressing hurt over a friend's comments, not expressing a desire to die.
    *   Since the answer to both is 'No' (in terms of the poster's own intent/desire), the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):** Not applicable, as the poster does not express suicidal intent or desire to die.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:** Not applicable, as the poster does not describe a specific past concrete action to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly shows significant distress, hurt, and struggles with mental health.
    *   The words ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" are present, but they are used to recount what a friend said *about* the poster, or in a hypothetical context related to the friend's words. They do not represent the poster's own suicidal thoughts, feelings, or desire to die.
    *   The primary focus of the post is the emotional impact of the friend's words and seeking advice on how to address the situation with the friend.
    *   There is no expression of the poster's own desire to die, no plan for suicide, and no description of a past attempt.
    *   According to the definitions, 'Indicator' applies when there are general expressions of distress, sadness, or hopelessness, but a lack of explicit expression concerning suicide *from the poster* or a clear desire to die. This post fits that description.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""jump out"" in the context of distress and being at a window clearly indicates suicidal intent. ""Scissors"" are mentioned as a tool to ""cut the screen"" to facilitate the jump, implying means for self-harm/suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""please please please help me,"" ""i feel like im about to,"" ""i dont know what to do,"" ""my parents and siblings are asleep"" convey extreme distress, urgency, helplessness, and a sense of isolation.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""jump out""
        - Means: ""scissors"" (to cut the screen, enabling the jump)
        - Location: ""at my window right now""
        - Timeframe: ""right now,"" ""im about to"" (indicates immediacy/imminence)
        - Preparations: Being at the window with the scissors and stating ""im about to"" suggests active preparation and proximity to the act.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""I feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of intent to end one's life.
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die/end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): Yes.
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific **method**: Yes, ""jump out"".
        - Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: Yes, ""scissors"" to cut the screen.
        - A specific **location**: Yes, ""at my window right now"".
        - A specific **timeframe**: Yes, ""right now,"" ""im about to"".
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: Being at the window with the scissors and stating ""im about to"" indicates immediate preparation and intent.
    - Conclusion: Yes, multiple elements of a specific plan are present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post describes a current, imminent situation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to end life (""jump out""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post includes a specific method (""jump out""), specific means (""scissors"" to cut the screen), a specific location (""at my window""), and a specific timeframe (""right now,"" ""im about to""). These elements constitute a clear plan, which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Since a specific plan is present, it is stronger than 'Ideation'.

Based on the analysis, the post fits the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""i'm gonna overdose on iron pills"" is a direct statement of intent to self-harm with lethal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it"" indicates chronic distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape suffering. ""i'm sorry"" suggests despair and possibly a farewell.
    *   **Specific plans:** ""overdose on iron pills"" clearly states a specific method (overdose) and specific means (iron pills). The phrase ""i'm gonna"" indicates current intent to carry out this plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past actions are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post does not explicitly use the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""overdose on iron pills"" is an unambiguous expression of intent to end one's life.
    *   The phrase ""i don't wanna deal with it"" in conjunction with the overdose plan clearly expresses a desire to cease existing to escape pain.
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die/end life. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    *   **Specific method:** ""overdose"" - Yes.
    *   **Specific means:** ""iron pills"" - Yes, this is the substance to be used.

    *   **Clear signs of preparation:** The mention of ""iron pills"" implies they are available or being considered for immediate use.
    *   Given the presence of a specific method and means with clear intent, this strongly points to 'Behavior'.

    *   The post expresses a clear desire to end suffering and explicitly states a specific method (""overdose"") and means (""iron pills"") to achieve this. This directly fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts/a desire to die AND mentions a plan with a specific method and means. It is not 'Indicator' because there's clear suicidal intent. It's not 'Ideation' because a specific plan (method/means) is present. It's not 'Attempt' because it describes future intent, not a past concrete action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""im going to kill myself one day"", ""might as well die"", ""fucking die"", ""want to disappear"".
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""dont even know what that is. life. i dont even know since it isnt even mine. i hate it!""), despair (deferred from dream school, abusive parents, no money, no friends, feel like a failure, made fun of), worthlessness (""feel like a failure who might as well die"", ""that person everyone makes fun of at school"").
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned. ""Run away to a forest and fucking die"" implies dying in a forest, but not *how*.
        - Means: None mentioned.
        - Location: ""a forest"". This is a specific location.
        - Timeframe: ""one day"". This is not a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"", ""next week"", a specific date/age).
        - Preparations: None mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No descriptions of past concrete actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""im going to kill myself one day"" (explicit suicide mention) and ""might as well die"", ""fucking die"", ""want to disappear"" (clear desire to die/cease existing).
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations?
        - Method: No specific method.
        - Means: No specific means.
        - Location: ""a forest"" is mentioned as a place to die.
        - Timeframe: ""one day"" is not a specific timeframe as defined for 'Behavior' (e.g., ""tonight"", ""on my birthday"", ""at 21""). It indicates a future, non-specific intent.
        - Preparations: No preparations are mentioned.
    - While a location (""a forest"") is mentioned, the lack of a specific method and, crucially, the vague timeframe (""one day"") prevent this from being classified as a concrete *plan* for suicide as required for 'Behavior'. The post also mentions a significant stopping factor (""the only thing thats stopping is that there is still a chance to get in to a college somewhere far, far away""). The guideline states: ""If suicidal intent/desire to die is present, but you are genuinely uncertain about the presence of an explicit plan (as defined by method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation), choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" The vagueness of ""one day"" and the lack of a specific method make the plan uncertain in terms of imminence and execution.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""kill myself"", ""fucking die"", ""want to disappear""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. While a location (""a forest"") is mentioned, the key phrase ""im going to kill myself one day"" indicates a future, non-specific intent rather than a concrete, actionable plan with a specific timeframe or method. The definition for 'Behavior' requires a *specific* timeframe or method, which is not present here. The desire to ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" is a strong expression of suicidal ideation and a desired setting, but not a defined plan for *how* or *when* the act would be carried out. Therefore, it falls under 'Ideation'.

74,"Hoping to be murdered. I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die. I'm so hyperaware of how I'm clearly defective and unfit to be alive. It's like I have a terminal illness no one recognizes. I just have to pray for some random person to murder me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""Hoping to be murdered."" (Clear desire for death, albeit by external means)
        *   ""I hate being alive"" (Clear desire not to be alive)
        *   ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself"" (Explicit mention of ""kill myself"", indicating suicidal thoughts but also an inability to act)
        *   ""someone will just end my life for me."" (Clear desire for death)
        *   ""assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people."" (Explicit mention of ""suicide"" and ""suicidal"")
        *   ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered"" (Clear desire for death)
        *   ""to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself."" (Clear desire to end life, reiterating inability to act)
        *   ""how much I want to die."" (Explicit desire to die)
        *   ""I just have to pray for some random person to murder me."" (Clear desire for death)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hate being alive,"" ""losing more hope,"" ""life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends,"" ""increasingly difficult to endure,"" ""tearing up randomly throughout each day,"" ""crying myself to sleep,"" ""useless I am,"" ""alone I am,"" ""clearly defective and unfit to be alive."" (Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, anhedonia, and severe emotional pain).
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   Methods: The post explicitly states ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself"" and expresses a wish to be murdered by someone else. There is no mention of a *self-inflicted* method.
        *   Means: None mentioned.
        *   Locations: ""walk through sketchy areas every night"" is mentioned as a place where they *hope* to be murdered, not a location *they* plan to go to *to commit suicide themselves*. This does not qualify as a self-directed plan element.
        *   Timeframes: None for a self-inflicted act.
        *   Preparations: None.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""kill myself,"" ""suicidal people,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""end it all,"" and ""I want to die."" It also contains unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""I hate being alive,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered"").
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses a very strong desire to die and end suffering, but it explicitly states the poster lacks the ability/courage to kill themselves. The desire for ""murder"" is a wish for an external force to end their life, not a plan for *self-inflicted* suicide. There is no mention of a specific method, means, location (for self-harm), timeframe, or preparations for *their own* suicide. The ""sketchy areas"" mention is a hope for external intervention, not a plan for personal action.
    *   Since there is no specific plan for *self-inflicted* suicide, it does not fit the 'Behavior' category.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life (e.g., ""I overdosed last year,"" ""when I tried to cut my wrists"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a strong desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""suicidal,"" ""I want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   However, it explicitly states the poster's inability to act (""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself"") and expresses a wish for an external force (murder) to end their life, rather than outlining a personal plan for suicide (method, means, location for self-harm, timeframe, preparation). This distinction means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die, but without a self-directed plan.

Take care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm going to die"", ""leave"" (in context of ending life), ""See you all on the other side."" The phrase ""my favorite part is I'll experience it painfully"" suggests a specific, self-inflicted way of dying, even if not a full method.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""glad I'm going to die"" (paradoxical, but indicates severe distress and decision), ""unwanted"", ""can't take no more"", ""shithole"" (referring to life), ""What a joke.""
    *   **Specific plans:** No explicit method (like ""pills"" or ""jumping"") or specific location. However, ""See you all on the other side. Take care."" functions as a clear farewell/goodbye, which is a form of preparation. The statement ""8,000 days and I can't take no more"" implies an immediate breaking point and imminent action, acting as an implicit timeframe.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die: ""I'm going to die"", ""I can't take no more"", ""See you all on the other side."" This clearly indicates suicidal intent, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Given the clear suicidal intent, I need to check for elements of a plan.
    *   **Specific method:** ""I'll experience it painfully"" implies a desired *manner* of death, but not a concrete method.
    *   **Specific means:** No specific means mentioned (e.g., ""I have the pills"").
    *   **Specific location:** No specific location mentioned.
    *   **Specific timeframe:** While not ""tonight"" or ""tomorrow"", ""8,000 days and I can't take no more"" strongly conveys that the limit has been reached *now* and the action is imminent. This implies a very near-future timeframe.
    *   **Clear signs of preparation:** ""See you all on the other side. Take care."" is a very strong indicator of a final goodbye, which is explicitly listed as a form of preparation (""saying final goodbyes"" or ""getting my affairs in order"" are examples under 'Behavior' definition for means/preparation).

    *   The presence of a clear farewell/goodbye (preparation) and the strong implication of an immediate timeframe (""can't take no more"") are sufficient to classify this as 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm going to die,"" ""I can't take no more,"" ""See you all on the other side""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is suicidal thoughts *without* a specific plan. 'Behavior' includes suicidal thoughts *with* elements of a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations).
    *   The phrase ""See you all on the other side. Take care."" functions as a clear farewell, which is a form of preparation/getting affairs in order, and is explicitly part of the 'Behavior' definition. The statement ""8,000 days and I can't take no more"" also indicates an immediate, imminent timeframe. These elements move it beyond mere ideation into 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" and ""im starting to want to wave the white flag."" These phrases, in context of severe distress, indicate a desire to cease existing or give up on life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""tired of only feeling sadness and anxiety,"" ""tired of the depression and anxiety,"" ""tired of being a burden,"" ""soul is hurting,"" ""happiness has been out of my reach,"" ""emotionally abusive mom."" These clearly show hopelessness, despair, and severe distress.
    - Specific plans: No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. ""I've tried every way to cope"" refers to coping mechanisms, not suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - However, there are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" and ""im starting to want to wave the white flag."" These are direct expressions of a desire to cease existing or give up on life.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die/not be alive, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post does not mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. References to trying ""every antidepressant"" or ""every way to cope"" are not descriptions of suicide attempts. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" ""im starting to want to wave the white flag""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation' (""a clear desire to not be alive any longer"").
    - It lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action of attempting suicide, distinguishing it from 'Attempt'.
    - It expresses more than just general distress; it expresses a desire to cease existing, distinguishing it from 'Indicator'.

    - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness (""I have nothing,"" ""no reason to stay here,"" ""future is fucked,"" ""Nothing is going well for me and it isn't getting better""), despair, worthlessness, clear distress.
    - Specific plans: No mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations.

    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a strong desire and intent to die (""I have to kill myself,"" ""Death is my only option right now,"" ""I have to do this""), but it does *not* mention:
        - A specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping"").

        - A specific location.
        - A specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
        - Clear signs of preparation.
    - Because there is no specific plan as defined, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It focuses on current intent and feelings.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal like me some time ago"" (referring to self in the past), ""I really, really wish lives were donate-able"", ""I really wish I could somehow donate my life"", ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"", ""I just wish I could donate my life"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" indicates hopelessness, worthlessness, and a clear desire not to be alive.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The wish to ""donate my life"" is a hypothetical desire to cease existing for another's benefit, not a concrete plan for self-harm.
    - Past concrete actions: The phrase ""suicidal like me some time ago"" is a vague reference to past ideation, not a description of a specific concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post does not contain explicit terms like ""kill myself"" or ""end my life"" directly in the present tense.
    - However, it contains clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or cease existing: ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and ""I just wish I could donate my life"". These phrases directly convey a desire to not be alive.
    - Therefore, Yes, there is a clear desire to die/not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on the presence of suicidal intent/desire to die, the post does NOT mention:
        - A specific method for suicide.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed.
        - A specific location being considered.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide.
        - Clear signs of preparation.
    - The concept of ""donating my life"" is a metaphorical expression of wanting to die for another's benefit, not a concrete plan for how to achieve it.
    - No, there are no elements of a plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post states ""suicidal like me some time ago,"" but this is a general statement about past ideation, not a description of a ""specific past concrete action"" taken to try to end their life (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists"").
    - No, there is no description of a past concrete attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, there is a clear desire to die/not be alive (""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" ""I wish I could donate my life""). This means it is beyond 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 3, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm ready to die."", ""Hope it all ends soon."", ""Soda and junk will kill me faster."" (indirect, but indicates a desire for death). ""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid."" (desire for a fatal outcome).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of it,"" ""tired of working on healing,"" ""fucking joke,"" ""waste of time and energy,"" ""Fuck weight loss."" (hopelessness, despair, frustration, giving up).
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Methods:** ""Soda and junk will kill me faster."" (a stated, albeit passive and long-term, method). ""Stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" (Cessation of vital medication can be considered a method to hasten death or a preparatory step, especially given the context of wanting to die).
        *   **Means:** N/A (not acquiring, but *stopping* existing means of health maintenance).
        *   **Locations:** None.
        *   **Specific timeframes:** ""today"" (for stopping meds), ""soon"" (for it all to end).
        *   **Preparations:** ""I'm stopping all my meds today."", ""I'm quitting therapy."" These are concrete actions that remove support systems and health maintenance, presented in the context of wanting to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   ""I'm ready to die."" - Yes, a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    *   ""Hope it all ends soon."" - Yes, a clear desire for life to cease.
    *   This is clearly beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post mention:
        *   A specific **method**: ""Soda and junk will kill me faster."" (Yes, a stated method). ""Stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" (This is a concrete action taken *today* that impacts health and life, presented as a deliberate step in the context of wanting to die. Stopping vital medication, like blood pressure meds, can be considered a method to hasten death or a significant preparatory step).
        *   Specific **means being acquired or possessed with intent**: While not acquiring, the *cessation* of life-sustaining medication is a deliberate action concerning means that impact life, with clear intent (desire to die).
        *   A specific **timeframe**: ""today"" for stopping meds. This is a concrete action with a specific timeframe.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: ""I'm stopping all my meds today."" and ""I'm quitting therapy."" These are concrete actions that remove support and health maintenance, aligning with preparatory steps for ending life.
    *   Given the explicit desire to die, combined with the concrete actions of stopping vital medication *today* and quitting therapy, and the stated passive method of ""soda and junk will kill me faster,"" this fits the criteria for 'Behavior'. The cessation of medication is a deliberate, time-bound action that goes beyond mere ideation.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No description of a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm ready to die"", ""Hope it all ends soon""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post describes concrete actions and preparations with a specific timeframe: ""I'm stopping all my meds today"" (including vital blood pressure medication) and ""I'm quitting therapy."" These are deliberate steps taken *today* that remove life-sustaining support and health maintenance, in the context of wanting to die. The phrase ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" also describes a chosen method. These elements move the classification from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior' because they constitute a plan or preparations for ending life, even if some methods are passive.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete suicide attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""I just want to disappear"" implies a desire to cease existence. ""Free from all this pain"" and ""broken remainings of my soul"" indicate severe emotional distress and a wish for an end to suffering. No direct mentions of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, pain, brokenness, hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No mention of any past actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""I just want to disappear"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to cease existing or not be alive. The desire to be ""free from all this pain"" for the ""broken remainings of my soul"" reinforces this desire to end suffering by ceasing to exist.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die/not be alive, this post is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific method? No.
        *   Specific means? No.
        *   A specific location? No.
        *   A specific timeframe? No.
        *   Clear signs of preparation? No.
    *   There are no elements of a specific plan present. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There is no description of *what* they did.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""I just want to disappear,"" ""free from all this pain"") which rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not contain any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The definition of 'Ideation' includes ""a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan."" This perfectly matches the content of the post.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""plan for suicide"" are direct mentions.
    - Emotional indicators: The rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" indicates severe distress and a lack of reasons to live.
    - Specific plans: The phrase ""I just need a plan for suicide"" indicates a desire to *formulate* a plan, but does not describe an *existing* specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""suicide."" It clearly expresses a desire to die. This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method? No.
    - Does it mention specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
    - Does it mention a specific location? No.
    - Does it mention a specific timeframe? No.
    - Does it mention clear signs of preparation? No.
    - The statement ""I just need a plan for suicide"" signifies the *absence* of a plan, but a strong desire to find one. According to the definition of 'Behavior', a plan MUST include one or more specific elements (method, means, location, timeframe, tools/substances, preparation). Since none of these specific elements are present, despite the strong intent, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The guideline states: ""If suicidal intent/desire to die is present, but you are genuinely uncertain about the presence of an explicit plan... choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Here, there is no explicit plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. While the user is actively seeking a plan, the post itself does not *contain* any specific elements of a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) as required by the 'Behavior' definition. Therefore, it falls under 'Ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without a specific plan being detailed.

82,"I need to find someone who relates. Does anyone else find themselves almost uncontrollably saying ""I'm going to kill myself""? I say other things like ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (relating to my most recent failed attempt) and ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"". It's almost like Tourettes but I know it's not. I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm going to kill myself"" (direct suicidal statement), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" (self-harm with potential suicidal intent), ""pretending to blow my brains out"" (simulated suicide action).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses a feeling of lack of control (""almost uncontrollably saying""), distress, and seeks validation/relatability.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method, means, location, or timeframe for a *future* suicide act is mentioned. The ""finger gun"" is a simulation, not a plan.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""I wish I stayed in the car (relating to my most recent failed attempt)"" - This is a clear and direct reference to a ""failed attempt,"" which implies a past concrete action taken to end their life. The phrase ""failed attempt"" itself denotes a past action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""I'm going to kill myself"" and a clear desire to have died (""I wish I stayed in the car""). This confirms it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   While there is strong ideation (""I'm going to kill myself""), there is no mention of a specific *future* plan (e.g., ""I'm going to take pills tonight,"" ""I have a gun ready,"" ""I'm going to jump from X location""). The ""finger gun"" is a simulation, not a concrete plan. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' based on a *current* plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post states: ""I wish I stayed in the car (relating to my most recent failed attempt)"". This directly describes a ""failed attempt"" and provides context (""stayed in the car""). This explicitly meets the definition for 'Attempt': ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life (e.g., 'I overdosed last year,' 'when I tried to cut my wrists,' 'my failed attempt with pills five months ago')."" The phrase ""my most recent failed attempt"" is a direct equivalent to the examples provided.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a specific *current* plan, so it's not 'Behavior' based on current plans.
    *   It clearly and directly references a ""most recent failed attempt,"" which is a past concrete action. According to the definitions, if a post describes a past attempt, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. The rule also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" In this case, it mentions a past attempt and current ideation/simulated actions. The presence of the past attempt is the defining factor.

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal."" It also says, ""I hate my life.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with indicators of severe distress: ""I Hate Being Ugly,"" ""People are condescending and mean,"" ""treat me as inferior,"" ""feel worthless,"" ""abused my entire life,"" ""bullied,"" ""sick of it,"" ""lost all my sanity,"" ""don't know what to do."" These clearly show hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans:** There are no mentions of specific methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide. The discussion about plastic surgery is a desire for a solution to their perceived ugliness, not a suicide plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There is no description of any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the explicit term ""suicidal.""
    *   Yes, it contains a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die: ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore.""
    *   Since there are explicit mentions and a clear desire to die, the post is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jumping"").
    *   The post does not mention specific means being acquired or possessed.
    *   The post does not mention a specific location.
    *   The post does not mention a specific timeframe.
    *   The post does not show clear signs of preparation.
    *   Therefore, the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. It mentions being ""abused my entire life"" and ""bullied,"" but this refers to general life experiences, not suicide attempts.
    *   Therefore, the post does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""suicidal,"" ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"").
    *   It does *not* contain any elements of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation).
    *   It does *not* describe a past concrete suicide attempt.

I thought I was doing fine but just today I realised none of my other friends really give a shit about me.

I started college this year and its been so horrible. I was robbed of a place to stay so I've had to live at home while everyone else has parties and enjoys their college experience. I haven't made a single friend, let alone done anything fun. At this point it just feels like I'm just going through the motions. Is this my life now?

I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day of this seemingly endless torment.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day of this seemingly endless torment.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""endless torment,"" ""horrible,"" ""struggling,"" ""nobody to talk to,"" ""nothing to do,"" ""don't want it."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, isolation, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans:** There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), specific means being acquired, a specific location, a concrete timeframe (e.g., ""tonight at 8 PM,"" ""next Tuesday""), or preparations (e.g., writing notes, giving away things). The word ""now"" indicates urgency of feeling, but not a defined plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, it also expresses a clear desire not to be alive: ""If that's what my life is going to be I don't want it.""
    *   This confirms it is more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent is present (from step 2).
    *   However, the post *does not* mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide. It expresses a desire to end life *now* due to suffering, but not *how* or *where* or *when* in a planned sense.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post *does not* describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It focuses on current feelings and a future desire to end life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal language (""kill myself"") and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, preparation), ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to kill myself"", ""blow my brains out"", ""pull the trigger"", ""how it would feel to die"". These are direct and strong.
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""urge"", ""too much of a pussy"", ""can never bring myself to actually do it"". These indicate internal conflict and a struggle with the suicidal urges.
    - Specific plans: The post mentions methods (""blow my brains out"", ""pull the trigger"") but immediately negates any intent to act on them, stating ""I'm scared"", ""I don't want to leave my cats/friends"", ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"", and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it."" There are no specific means, locations, timeframes, or preparations mentioned. The methods are presented as urges/thoughts, not elements of a plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""blow my brains out,"" which are direct phrases indicating a desire to die.
    - This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - The post mentions potential methods (""blow my brains out"", ""pull the trigger""). However, it explicitly states that the poster *cannot* bring themselves to do it (""I'm scared"", ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"", ""I can never bring myself to actually do it""). This indicates that while the *thought* of a method is present, it is not part of a *plan* that is being considered or acted upon. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a plan or self-harming behavior intended to lead to suicide. The explicit statements of inability to act negate the presence of a current, actionable plan. There are no mentions of specific means being acquired, specific locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""I want to kill myself"", ""urge to just blow my brains out""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The crucial distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. While methods are mentioned, they are presented as urges or thoughts that the person is *unable* to act upon, rather than elements of a concrete plan or preparation. The post explicitly states ""I can never bring myself to actually do it."" This fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide."" The internal conflict and inability to act on the urges prevent it from being classified as 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains direct requests for death: ""kill me,"" ""murder me,"" ""end my horrible life.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""horrible life,"" ""i beg of you"" indicate extreme distress, despair, and a desperate plea for cessation of life.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post mentions ""i'll dm the address, please come here and murder me."" This indicates a specific location (""the address,"" ""here"") and a desired method (""murder me""). However, this is a request for *external* action (murder by another person), not a *self-inflicted* suicide plan. The definitions for 'Behavior' specifically refer to a ""plan to commit suicide"" or ""self-harming behavior intended to lead to suicide.""
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""end my horrible life"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life. ""kill me"" and ""murder me"" are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/cease existing.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear and unambiguous desire to die. This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention a specific plan for *self-inflicted* suicide?
        *   A specific **method** for *suicide*? No, the method requested is *murder* by another person, not a self-inflicted method.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent for *suicide*? No.
        *   A specific **location** being considered for *suicide*? ""the address,"" ""here"" are locations, but they are tied to the request for *murder*, not for the poster to commit suicide themselves.
        *   A specific **timeframe** for carrying out *suicide*? No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation** for *suicide*? No.
    *   The crucial distinction for 'Behavior' is that the plan must be for the individual to *commit suicide* or engage in *self-harming behavior intended to lead to suicide*. The post describes a plan for someone else to murder them, which, while a plan for death, is not a *self-inflicted suicide plan* as defined for 'Behavior'. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city. I haven't dated in years (I don't think I'm very attractive tbh, but this doesn't bother me that much). My family is nuts. I feel like I wasn't allowed a normal childhood, and I've spent my whole life trying to avoid being 'trapped,' but every time I make progress, I wind up worse off than before.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time."" (Indicates a lack of fear of death).
        *   ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen."" (Explicitly denies intent to act on suicidal thoughts/desires).
        *   ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"" (Suggests a desire for cessation of struggle, which in context of not fearing death, implies a desire for life to end or not to be alive).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Feeling of dread, despair, feeling trapped, feeling worse off, feeling worthless (""I deserve it"").
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations. The statement ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" explicitly negates a plan for action.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life.""
    *   However, the phrase ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"" combined with ""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time"" constitutes a clear, albeit passive, desire to not be alive or for the struggle of living to cease. This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition's examples like ""I want it to be over"" or ""I wish I could disappear,"" as it expresses a longing for an end to their current state of existence/struggle. The explicit denial of *deliberate action* (""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"") means there's no *plan*, but the *desire* is present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The post explicitly states, ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen,"" which rules out a plan for current action. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire for things to end (""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"") and a lack of fear of dying (""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time""). This goes beyond general distress and indicates a clear desire to not be alive, which means it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to not be alive (or for the struggle of living to cease) but no specific plan for suicide and no description of a past concrete attempt, the post best fits the 'Ideation' category. The statement ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" confirms the *lack of a plan*, while the preceding sentences establish the *desire*.

        *   Specific means being acquired or possessed.
        *   A specific location being considered.
        *   A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide.
        *   Clear signs of preparation.
    *   Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does NOT describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It mentions past ""suicidal thoughts"" but not a physical act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to ""let go"" in a distressed context, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive any longer, without any specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""planning to kill myself tonight"", ""Rest In Peace ya'll"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""Everyone who could help me is asleep now"", ""I don't wish them any grief or guilt. This is my problem, my illness, it's on me. I expect nothing from no one."" (indicates hopelessness, isolation, self-blame, finality).
    - Specific plans: ""planning to kill myself tonight"" - this includes a specific timeframe (""tonight""). The phrase ""Rest In Peace ya'll"" and the preceding sentences about not wishing grief/guilt can be interpreted as a farewell or preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly states ""planning to kill myself"". This is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
    - Since there's an explicit mention, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post mentions a specific **timeframe**: ""tonight"".
    - It also contains elements of **preparation** and a farewell: ""I don't wish them any grief or guilt. This is my problem, my illness, it's on me. I expect nothing from no one. Rest In Peace ya'll. ✌️"". This is a clear sign of getting affairs in order or saying goodbyes.
    - Since both a specific timeframe and signs of preparation are present, this strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. It describes a current plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a specific timeframe (""tonight"") and clear signs of preparation/farewell (""Rest In Peace ya'll"", ""I don't wish them any grief or guilt""). These elements constitute a plan as defined under 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Because a plan (timeframe, preparation) is present, it is more than just 'Ideation'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing."" ""I need to leave"" in the context of not belonging here and thinking about suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""suffer extraordinary pain,"" ""don't belong here."" These indicate severe distress, self-blame, and a desire to escape.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains an explicit mention of ""suicide.""
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die/cease existing (""I don't belong here. I need to leave"" in conjunction with the suicide thought).
    - This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post states ""I'm starting to think suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing."" This expresses a thought/desire, but it does not include:
        - A specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump"").
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed.
        - A specific location.
        - A specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
        - Clear signs of preparation.
    - Therefore, there is no explicit plan as defined for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It discusses current thoughts and feelings.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""I don't belong here. I need to leave""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like 'suicide') OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""practicing hanging myself,"" ""finally do it"" (referring to suicide), ""deserves to die,"" ""Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy,"" ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""My life is fucked now,"" ""no turning it around,"" ""worthless trash,"" ""pain and this fucking shit life."" (hopelessness, worthlessness, despair).
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""hanging myself"" (explicit method).
        - Preparations: ""I've been practicing hanging myself,"" ""I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct."" This is a very strong indicator of active preparation.
        - Timeframe: ""for the day when I finally do it,"" ""will be over soon"" (implies future intent, but not a precise date/time).
    - Past concrete actions: The ""practicing"" is a current/ongoing preparatory action for a future suicide, not a description of a past failed attempt. The post states ""when I finally do it,"" indicating the act itself has not yet occurred.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains unambiguous expressions of wanting to die and end life: ""deserves to die,"" ""Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy,"" ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon."" The phrase ""finally do it"" in the context of ""hanging myself"" also clearly indicates suicidal intent.
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die. Therefore, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, the post mentions a specific method (""hanging myself"").
    - Yes, it mentions clear signs of preparation: ""I've been practicing hanging myself,"" and ""I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct."" This goes beyond mere ideation and describes active steps being taken towards carrying out the act.
    - This strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post describes ""practicing hanging myself,"" which is a current/ongoing preparatory action for a future suicide, not a description of a specific past concrete action to end their life. The phrasing ""when I finally do it"" confirms it's not a past attempt.
    - No, this is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and end life (ruling out 'Indicator').
    - It explicitly mentions a specific method (""hanging myself"") and describes active, concrete preparation (""practicing hanging myself,"" ""going to keep practicing, train myself""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' precisely, as it includes suicidal intent *and* elements of a plan/preparation.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action of an attempt (ruling out 'Attempt').
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

Tonight it happened twice. the first time i screamed at her to shut up and the second time i screamed i would kill her and whipped a blanket at her. My mom was there and she said i scared her. I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about. I dont want to get into any relationships (not that i would anyway) because i can snap like this.

I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die."", ""I want to disappear."", ""one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone"" (this is a clear indirect expression of suicidal intent). The phrase ""I will kill her"" refers to the dog, not self-harm.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I know i'm a piece of shit."", ""feel like absolute shit"", ""I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about."", ""I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them"", ""I am on the edge"". These indicate self-loathing, guilt, fear of harming others, and being at a breaking point.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: No explicit method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned. ""take myself away from here"" is not a specific method.
        - Means: None mentioned.
        - Location: None mentioned.
        - Specific timeframes: ""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here"". ""Tonight"" is a specific, immediate timeframe mentioned in relation to the suicidal intent.
        - Preparations: None mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None. The post discusses current feelings and future possibilities.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - ""I want to die."" - Yes, explicit.
    - ""I want to disappear."" - Yes, clear desire to cease existing.
    - ""one day i will take myself away from here"" - Yes, clear desire to end their life.
    - Since there are clear desires to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No.
        - Specific means: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: Yes, ""if not tonight"". This explicitly mentions ""tonight"" as a potential timeframe for the suicidal action (""take myself away from here""). The definition for 'Behavior' includes ""a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., 'I'm ending it tonight')"". This matches.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - The mention of ""tonight"" as a specific timeframe for the act, even if conditional (""if not tonight""), indicates a current consideration of action within an immediate timeframe. This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit desires to die (""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""take myself away from here""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - We need to differentiate between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is suicidal thoughts without a plan, while 'Behavior' includes suicidal thoughts *with* a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations).
    - The phrase ""I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here"" includes a specific timeframe (""tonight"") for the potential suicidal act. This specific timeframe, even if conditional, is sufficient to classify it as 'Behavior' according to the provided definitions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish."" However, it also states, ""I just don't want to exist.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""feel like trash,"" ""don't know what's wrong with me,"" ""don't know what to do anymore,"" ""no purpose in life,"" ""feel like disappointment,"" ""draining,"" ""anxiety attacks."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? It mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" but immediately follows with a denial (""Im not suicidal or something"").
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I just don't want to exist."" This is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to cease existing, which falls under the 'Ideation' definition's examples like ""I wish I could disappear"" or ""I want it to be over."" Even with the denial of being ""suicidal,"" the desire to ""not exist"" is present.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to not be alive (""I just don't want to exist""), the post is more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present via ""I just don't want to exist""), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No, none of these elements are present.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No, there is no description of any past attempt.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear desire to not be alive (""I just don't want to exist""), which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""a clear desire to not be alive any longer"").
    *   Despite the explicit denial (""Im not suicidal or something""), the presence of ""I just don't want to exist"" indicates a level of distress that goes beyond general unhappiness and points towards a wish to cease living.
    *   There are no specific plans (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There are no descriptions of past concrete actions, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The level of distress and the explicit desire to ""not exist"" goes beyond what is defined for 'Indicator' (which lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die).

Based on this analysis, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""death,"" ""taking my life,"" ""suicide,"" ""suicidal,"" and ""I attempted suicide last week.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""insanity and hopelessness,"" ""worthlessness,"" ""sadistic world,"" ""never-ending cycle.""
    *   **Specific plans:** The post *does not* mention a specific method, means, location, or timeframe for a *future* suicide. It discusses the *concept* of taking one's life and a *past* attempt.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** The post clearly states: ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note"" and ""(Un)fortunately my attempt had failed"". This is a direct description of a past concrete action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains multiple explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""taking my life,"" and a clear desire for ""death.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   No, the post does not describe a *current* specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations) for a *future* suicide. It describes a *past* attempt.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post clearly states, ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note"" and ""my attempt had failed."" This is a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation and a clear desire to die, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a *current* specific plan for suicide, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    *   Crucially, the post explicitly describes a *specific past concrete action* taken to end their life (""I attempted suicide last week""). This directly matches the definition for 'Attempt'. The presence of a described past concrete action overrides other categories.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill you"" (in the context of self-harm/suicide), ""I just want this nightmare to end"" (clear desire to cease existing/suffering).
    - Emotional indicators: Fear, despair, desire for suffering to end.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: Valium overdose (implied by ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"").
        - Means: Valium (implied by ""I haven't taken enough"").
        - Timeframe: Implied current/very recent action (""I haven't taken enough"" suggests the action has just occurred or is ongoing).
        - Preparations: The act of taking the Valium is itself a preparation/action.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""I haven't taken enough"" implies that the poster *has already taken* Valium with suicidal intent. This is a description of a concrete action that has occurred.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains explicit mentions of wanting to die/kill oneself (""kill you"", ""I just want this nightmare to end""). Yes.
    - Since 'Yes', the post is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent is present.
    - The post mentions a specific method (Valium overdose) and means (Valium).
    - The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" indicates that the person has *already taken* the Valium with suicidal intent. This is a concrete action taken as part of a plan or an attempt. This fits the 'Behavior' definition of ""exhibits self-harming behavior intended to lead to suicide.""

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life?
    - ""I haven't taken enough"" means ""I *have taken* some Valium, but it wasn't sufficient."" This is a clear description of a concrete action that has already occurred. While the examples for 'Attempt' are clearly historical (""last year"", ""five months ago""), the definition states ""describes one or more specific past concrete actions"". An action that just occurred is still a past action in relation to the moment of writing. The poster is describing having taken pills with suicidal intent, and assessing the outcome of that action. This is a description of an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die and mentions a specific method (Valium).
    - Crucially, the phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" indicates that the poster has *already performed a concrete action* (taken Valium) with suicidal intent. This is not merely planning for the future (Behavior's primary focus on planning) or expressing ideation. It is a description of an action that has already happened, even if very recently.
    - According to the definition, 'Attempt' is for content that ""describes one or more specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life."" The act of taking the Valium, as described by ""I haven't taken enough,"" is precisely such a concrete action.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I don't want to live at all"" (clear desire to die), ""Some of these are suicide attempts"" (direct mention), detailed descriptions of past actions: ""swallowed every single one [30 unisom sleeping pills]"", ""sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery"", ""took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail"". Also mentions a suicide note.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't want to live at all"", ""made me scared"" (referring to surviving), ""it's like I just don't die"".
    - Specific plans: No *current* specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) is mentioned. The post focuses on past events.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: Yes, multiple detailed descriptions of actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide attempts"" and a clear desire to die (""I don't want to live at all""). This means it's more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post describes *past* actions, not a *current* plan or *current* self-harming behavior intended to lead to suicide. There are no elements of a *current* specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post describes multiple specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life:
        - ""I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one.""
        - ""I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery.""
        - ""I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived.""
    - These are all clear descriptions of what the person *did* in a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and explicitly refers to past ""suicide attempts.""
    - Crucially, it provides detailed descriptions of specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.
    - According to the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life... A concrete action (what the person *did*) must be described."" This aligns perfectly with the post's content.
    - Since there are no *current* plans mentioned, it does not fit 'Behavior'. It clearly goes beyond 'Ideation' due to the detailed recounting of concrete past actions.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""All failing,"" ""feel my liver hurt every day,"" ""so stressed out,"" ""fucking everything up now,"" ""crying."" (Indicates hopelessness, despair, worthlessness).
    *   **Specific plans:** The post describes a specific method (""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob""), a specific location (""in the closet""), and a specific timeframe (""tonight""). It also describes preparations/actions taken towards this plan.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide:** ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This is a clear description of a concrete action taken with suicidal intent that was interrupted. It was an initiated attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""kill myself"" and clear expressions of wanting to end life (""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post describes a specific method (belt around neck), location (closet), and timeframe (tonight) for suicidal action. The statement ""I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch"" indicates current, active suicidal intent with a very high proximity to action, referring to the method just described. This would qualify for 'Behavior' if it were *only* a plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This is a description of an action taken to try to end their life, which was interrupted. It is a concrete, initiated attempt. The definition of 'Attempt' covers ""specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life."" Even though it was ""tonight"" and interrupted, it was an action taken. The rule also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" This post fits this exact criteria: it describes a concrete action (an interrupted attempt) and expresses strong current suicidal ideation/proximity to action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It describes a specific, concrete action taken with suicidal intent (""put a belt around my neck... Right before I passed out, I stopped""). This action, even though interrupted, constitutes a past attempt.
    *   The post also contains strong current suicidal ideation and a sense of being on the verge of action (""I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch."").
    *   According to the definitions, if a post describes a specific past concrete action (an attempt) AND also mentions current plans/ideation, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. The described action was an initiated attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""too tired of life"".
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The post explicitly states ""too scared to kill myself"", indicating a lack of immediate intent to act on the thoughts.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"".
    - Yes, there is an unambiguous expression of wanting to die (""too tired of life"").
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - However, the post does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation. In fact, it says ""too scared to kill myself"", which suggests a barrier to acting on the ideation, rather than a plan.
    - Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It discusses current feelings and thoughts about suicide, not a past attempt.
    - Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""suicide"") and a desire to not be alive (""too tired of life""). This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition.
    - Crucially, there is no specific plan mentioned (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation). The statement ""too scared to kill myself"" reinforces the absence of a plan or immediate intent to act.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action.
    - Thus, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""end this bullshit for good"" (strong indirect language for ending life), ""This will be my second to last post."" (implies impending death/end of communication). ""We start dying the second we are born."" (philosophical, not direct suicidal intent).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme anger, despair, hopelessness, nihilism (""human life has no fucking purpose"").
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method:** Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping"").
        *   **Means:** Not explicitly stated.
        *   **Location:** ""taking a trip"" implies a location, but it's not specific (e.g., ""the bridge"").
        *   **Specific timeframes:** ""in April"" (specific month). ""This will be my second to last post."" implies a very near future.
        *   **Preparations:** ""This will be my second to last post."" can be interpreted as a farewell or final communication before an act. ""taking a trip"" could be preparation to go to a specific location for the act.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   However, ""end this bullshit for good"" and ""This will be my second to last post"" are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to cease existing and ending their life. The context of ""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"" leaves little ambiguity.
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die/end life. Therefore, it is more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**? No.
        *   Specific **means**? No.
        *   A specific **location**? ""taking a trip"" is vague, not specific enough to qualify as a specific location for the act itself.
        *   A specific **timeframe**? YES, ""in April"" is a specific month, which constitutes a specific timeframe. ""This will be my second to last post"" also strongly implies an imminent timeframe.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? ""This will be my second to last post"" can be seen as a final message/preparation.
    *   Since a specific timeframe (""in April"") is mentioned, the criteria for 'Behavior' are met.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Based on Step 2, there is a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   This leaves 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'.
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to end life (""end this bullshit for good,"" ""This will be my second to last post"").
    *   Crucially, it includes a specific timeframe (""in April"") for carrying out the act, which is a defining characteristic of 'Behavior' according to the provided definition. The phrase ""This will be my second to last post"" further reinforces the imminence and planned nature of the act.

Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The post states, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything."" This is an indirect expression of a desire for death and mentions specific methods (being hit by a car, overdosing on medication).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""no body cares,"" ""no motivation,"" ""fucked myself over,"" ""parents don't even care,"" ""no one left to turn to,"" ""closest friends have other people,"" ""spend most of my time in my room,"" ""don't feel like anything anymore it's just blank."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, anhedonia, and severe isolation.
    *   **Specific plans:** The methods (""get hit by a car,"" ""od on meds"") are mentioned, but they are framed as a ""wish"" (""i just wish i could""). There is no mention of acquiring means, a specific location, a specific timeframe, or any preparations.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past suicide attempts or concrete self-harm actions are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything."" This is a clear, unambiguous expression of wanting to die, even if phrased as a wish. It goes beyond general distress and specifies ways they wish to cease existing.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method** for suicide? Yes, ""get hit by a car"" or ""od on meds.""
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent? No. The post does not state they have acquired pills, or are going to a specific road.
        *   A specific **location** being considered for suicide? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide? No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? No.
    *   The crucial part here is the phrasing ""i just wish i could"". While methods are named, they are expressed as a desire or fantasy, not as part of an active, concrete plan that includes acquisition of means, a timeframe, or preparation. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a *plan* that *must* include one or more of the listed elements. The ""wish"" indicates strong ideation about methods, but not the active planning or intent to execute that would qualify for 'Behavior'. The guideline states: ""If suicidal intent/desire to die is present, but you are genuinely uncertain about the presence of an explicit plan (as defined by method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation), choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" I am uncertain that a ""wish"" for a method constitutes a ""plan"" for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything""), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post mentions specific methods (getting hit by a car, overdosing on meds) but frames them as a ""wish"" rather than a concrete plan with acquired means, a timeframe, a location, or preparations. This distinction is key. 'Ideation' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide."" The mention of methods as a wish fits within strong ideation, but not the concrete planning required for 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post does not contain direct mentions of suicide, self-harm, death, or dying in relation to the poster. It uses strong language like ""daily torture of living life"" and expresses extreme despair and envy regarding physical appearance.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** High levels of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness (implied by feeling ""unwanted in literally all facets of life""), anger, bitterness, and profound dissatisfaction with life.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of any specific plans, methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post expresses extreme suffering and dissatisfaction with *living* in their current state (""daily torture of living life,"" ""Being unwanted in literally all facets of life""), and a strong desire to have been born differently (""I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way""). However, it does not express a direct desire to *die* or *not be alive* in the sense of ceasing to exist. The focus is on the misery of their current life, not the wish to end it.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die, this step is not directly applicable for classifying as 'Behavior'. Even if it were, there are no elements of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation).

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide and lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. It contains strong general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (""daily torture of living life,"" ""Being unwanted in literally all facets of life""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit suicidal thought or clear desire to not be alive any longer.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no suicidal intent combined with a plan.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as there is no description of a past concrete action.

    - Specific plans: No current specific plans (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" This is a clear description of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal"" and ""tried to kill myself"". Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""i'm better off dead"" is a direct expression of a desire to die.
    - Emotional indicators: The post implies sadness (""makes you sad"") and a questioning of common advice when applied to suicidal feelings. The "":D"" emoticon could be sarcastic or indicate a detached/cynical tone.
    - Specific plans: No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: No description of any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""i'm better off dead"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    - Conclusion: It is not 'Indicator'.

        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There is no description of an action taken, only a general expression of feeling.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die (""i'm better off dead""), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It does not contain any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), so it is not 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""overdose help please,"" and ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago."" It also asks ""could i survive an od like this or do i need to call emergency services?"" This clearly indicates a self-inflicted overdose.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""sorry,"" ""i dont know where else to post/ask this,"" ""my stomach is hurting very badly,"" ""sweating badly and shaking too,"" ""i feel like a burden,"" ""i did this to myself after all."" These show distress, physical symptoms, and self-blame.
    *   **Specific plans:** There is no future plan mentioned. The post describes a past action.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago."" This is a very clear and specific description of a concrete action taken by the poster.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   While the post doesn't use the exact words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" taking 44 paracetamol with the context of ""overdose help"" and asking if they can ""survive an od"" is an unambiguous expression of a self-inflicted, potentially lethal act. The statement ""i don't think i want to die but something is stopping me calling 999"" indicates ambivalence *after* the act, but the act itself implies initial suicidal intent or a severe cry for help through a self-harming action. The action itself is a strong indicator of a desire to end life or a severe crisis.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   This step is for *future* plans. The post describes an action that has *already occurred* (""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago""). Therefore, it does not fit the definition of 'Behavior' which focuses on current plans or ongoing self-harm intended to lead to suicide.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post describes a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life: ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago."" This is a clear description of an overdose, which is a concrete action. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes a specific past concrete action (""took 44 paracetamol"") that was a self-inflicted overdose. This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes one or more specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life."" The poster is experiencing physical symptoms from this action and is seeking help for it.

    *   The post expresses a clear desire to end one's life (""I want to end it""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, it explicitly states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" meaning there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation).
    *   There is no description of a past concrete attempt.
    *   Based on the definitions, a clear desire to not be alive without a specific plan falls under 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""sick and tired,"" ""vicious cycle of highs and lows,"" ""can't handle it anymore,"" ""don't know what to do with myself,"" ""feel like a robot,"" ""feel nothing and like I'm overloading,"" ""exhausted,"" ""hopeless,"" ""not fine."" These indicate severe emotional distress, anhedonia, and feelings of being overwhelmed and hopeless.
    *   Specific plans: No mention of method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations.
    *   Past concrete actions: No description of any past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life"": No.
    *   Other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: No. While the post expresses extreme distress, feeling overwhelmed (""can't handle it anymore""), and hopelessness, it does not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" or ""I want it all to end."" The language indicates a struggle to cope with life, not a direct desire for death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or desire to die identified in Step 2, this post does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post lacks any explicit mention of suicide and does not contain a clear, unambiguous desire to die or cease existing.
    *   It expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (""sick and tired,"" ""can't handle it anymore,"" ""hopeless,"" ""not fine"").
    *   This aligns directly with the definition of 'Indicator', which describes general expressions of distress without a clear desire for self-inflicted death. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit desire to die.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post mentions ""once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death."" This is presented in a philosophical context about hitting rock bottom and then getting better, not as a personal desire for death or intent to self-harm. The overall message is about improvement and hope.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""lonely and lost as ever,"" ""not knowing what to do wit my life,"" ""really bad bipolar tendencies,"" ""really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns."" However, these are balanced by ""overall better compared to the rest of my life,"" ""i feel more like myself,"" ""starting to accept who i am,"" ""it might get better for me,"" ""always a way to improve on something.""
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide:** No descriptions of past concrete actions to attempt suicide. The ""my rock bottom was having really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive"" describes a period of severe distress and symptoms, not a suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The mention of ""death"" is in the context of a metaphorical ""rock bottom"" from which the poster has recovered and is now improving. The overall tone is one of resilience and hope.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die, this step is not applicable for classifying as 'Behavior'. No plan elements (method, means, location, specific timeframe, preparation) are present.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The description of ""rock bottom"" refers to mental breakdowns and almost being abusive, not a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses mental health struggles (bipolar, depression, feeling lost) but also emphasizes therapy, improvement, acceptance, and finding ways to stay positive.
    *   Crucially, there is no explicit mention of suicide, no clear desire to die, no plans, and no descriptions of past suicide attempts.
    *   The phrase ""nothing lower but death"" is a philosophical statement about reaching the lowest point, not an expression of suicidal intent. The context shows the person has *passed* that rock bottom and is getting better.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'Indicator' definition as it expresses general distress and struggles but lacks any explicit suicidal ideation or desire to die.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""plan on ending it soon,"" ""overdosibg on ibuprofen.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""overwhelmed by guilt,"" ""don't know what else to do,"" ""pain scares me too much.""
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""overdosibg on ibuprofen... thats likely my go-to plan."" (Specific method identified)
        - Means: Implied by the method (ibuprofen).
        - Location: Not mentioned.
        - Specific timeframes: ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon."" (Specific but flexible timeframe mentioned)
        - Preparations: ""wish i could apologize a million times to my girlfriend and family"" (Suggests thoughts about the aftermath/goodbyes, a form of preparation).
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end life: ""plan on ending it soon.""
    - This confirms it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: Yes, ""overdosibg on ibuprofen... thats likely my go-to plan.""
        - A specific timeframe: Yes, ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon.""
        - Clear signs of preparation: Yes, ""wish i could apologize a million times to my girlfriend and family"" implies thoughts of final goodbyes/notes.
    - Since a specific method and timeframe are mentioned, this strongly points to 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post discusses current plans and feelings.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to end life (""plan on ending it soon""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post does not describe any past concrete actions to end life, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - The post explicitly states a ""go-to plan"" involving a specific method (""overdosibg on ibuprofen"") and mentions a timeframe (""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon""). These elements meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

Last night/this morning I relapsed and now I feel like shit. If I had a gun I'd kill myself because I know how this goes for me and right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future. I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself."" This is a direct mention of suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I feel like shit,"" ""not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future,"" ""I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up."" These indicate strong negative emotions, despair, and a sense of hopelessness about the future.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post mentions a method (""gun"") but it is conditional (""If I had a gun""). This does not indicate possession, acquisition, a specific timeframe, location, or preparations. It's a hypothetical statement of intent, not a concrete plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. The ""relapsed"" refers to an addiction, not a suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the phrase ""I'd kill myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide and a clear desire to die, even if conditional on having a means.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post mentions a method (""gun""), but it's conditional (""If I had a gun""). This does not indicate that the poster possesses the means, is actively acquiring them, or has a specific timeframe or location for an act. It's a hypothetical scenario, not a concrete plan as required for 'Behavior'. The guideline states: ""If suicidal intent/desire to die is present, but you are genuinely uncertain about the presence of an explicit plan (as defined by method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation), choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" The hypothetical nature makes it fall short of a concrete plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because there is an explicit desire to die (""I'd kill myself"").
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past concrete suicide action is described.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because, while a method (gun) is mentioned, it is presented hypothetically (""If I had a gun"") and does not constitute a specific, active plan (i.e., possessing means, acquiring means, specific timeframe, location, or preparation).
    *   It fits 'Ideation' because it contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (""I'd kill myself""), but without a concrete, active plan.

    - Emotional indicators: Distress, fear (of lung cancer), helplessness, frustration, anger.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""before i have to see him or myself get it"" is a condition for the desire, not a specific timeframe for an action.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""i just wanna kill myself"". This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die, but it does *not* mention a specific method (e.g., taking pills, jumping), specific means being acquired (e.g., bought a gun, written a note), a specific location (e.g., a bridge), or a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., ""tonight"", ""on my birthday""). The condition ""before I have to see him or myself get it"" is not a specific timeframe for an action; it's a reason for the desire. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to end one's life (""suicidal thoughts worse"", ""i just wanna kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide plan"", ""kill myself"", ""worthless existence"", ""move on from this worthless existence"", ""Goodbye reddit"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""worthless existence"", ""These past years have shit"", ""hope I don't get cold feet"".
    - Specific plans: ""I've got a suicide plan"", ""finally got a plan on how i can kill myself"", ""I plan on doing it next week"". This includes a specific timeframe (""next week"").
    - Preparations: ""My last time posting on this account."", ""Goodbye reddit thanks for the support and thanks for listening."" (suggests saying final goodbyes).
    - Past concrete actions: No descriptions of past concrete actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""worthless existence,"" ""move on from this worthless existence.""
    - Since there are explicit mentions and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No specific method is detailed.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed: No specific means are detailed.
        - A specific location: No specific location is detailed.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide: Yes, ""I plan on doing it next week.""
        - Clear signs of preparation: Yes, ""My last time posting on this account."" and ""Goodbye reddit thanks for the support and thanks for listening."" indicate saying goodbyes/preparing to end communication.
    - Since there is a specific timeframe and clear signs of preparation, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post refers to a future plan, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, and strictly following the definitions:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""kill myself"", ""suicide plan"") and a clear desire to die (""worthless existence""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It also contains elements of a plan: a specific timeframe (""next week"") and clear signs of preparation/goodbyes (""My last time posting on this account."", ""Goodbye reddit""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""have attempted suicide in the past"". It also mentions ""I've begun having those thoughts again.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Feeling bad,"" ""not sure how to proceed,"" ""long history of depression,"" ""pushed me back down,"" ""massive amounts of pain,"" ""feel terrible about it,"" ""feel like a piece of crap.""
    *   **Specific plans:** There are no specific plans (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations) mentioned for *current* suicidal intent. The post discusses seeking help (""helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try."").
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The post clearly states, ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This is a direct description of a past concrete action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""attempted suicide."" It also states ""I've begun having those thoughts again,"" indicating current ideation. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   While there are current ""suicidal thoughts,"" there is no mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for a *current* suicide act. The focus is on seeking help and internal conflict. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' based on a *current* plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This directly describes a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life. This fits the definition of 'Attempt'. The 'Attempt' definition also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" In this case, it mentions past attempts and current suicidal thoughts (ideation), which falls under the 'Attempt' category.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes a past concrete action of attempting suicide (""I have attempted suicide in the past""). This immediately places it into the 'Attempt' category according to the definitions provided. Even though there are current ""suicidal thoughts"" (Ideation), the explicit mention of a past *attempt* takes precedence for classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm), ""I can't even cut"" (referring to self-harm as a coping mechanism). No direct mention of suicide or death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""I can't socialize well,"" ""suffering,"" ""afraid he won't want baggage like me,"" ""go insane,"" ""so many issues,"" ""depression,"" ""It's getting to be too much."" These indicate severe distress, worthlessness, and feeling overwhelmed.
    - Specific plans: None. No method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of a past suicide attempt. The mention of ""I can't even cut"" refers to a desired coping mechanism that is currently unavailable, not a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post expresses severe distress, depression, and thoughts of self-harm, but it does not state ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" or similar direct expressions of a desire to cease existing. The phrase ""It's getting to be too much"" indicates being overwhelmed, not a desire to die. The ""thoughts of sh"" are framed as a coping mechanism (""cope in the way that works best"") rather than direct suicidal intent in this context.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die (as determined in Step 2), this post does not fit the criteria for 'Behavior'. There are no elements of a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) for suicide.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The mention of ""I can't even cut"" is about current inability to self-harm as a coping mechanism, not a description of a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant emotional distress, feelings of worthlessness (""baggage like me""), depression, and mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm). It also states ""It's getting to be too much.""
    - According to the definitions:
        - 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer."" This post does not contain such explicit expressions or a clear desire to die. While ""thoughts of sh"" are mentioned, they are presented as a coping mechanism, not as a direct suicidal thought or intent to die.
        - 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., 'I feel worthless,' 'I'm struggling').""
    - This post fits the 'Indicator' definition best. It conveys deep distress, depression, and feelings of being overwhelmed and unable to cope, including thoughts of self-harm. However, it does not cross the threshold into explicitly stating a desire to die or having suicidal thoughts (as opposed to self-harm as a coping mechanism).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""when I die"", ""if I'm dead"". These are direct references to the poster's own death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""my pain is finally over"", ""happy"" (in the context of being dead). This indicates severe distress and a belief that death is the only escape from pain and the only path to happiness.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly those exact terms.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. Phrases like ""Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over."" and ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead"" are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die and cease existing as a solution to pain.
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die expressed. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:

        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: No.

    - Conclusion: No specific plan elements are present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post discusses a future state (""when I die"", ""if I'm dead"") and current feelings, not a past action.
    - Conclusion: Not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear and unambiguous desire to die (""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead,"" ""my pain is finally over"" through death). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It does not contain any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation), so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action of attempting suicide, so it is not 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""kill myself,"" ""don't want to live.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""don't care about anything anymore,"" ""life is all downhill,"" ""career dreams are ruined,"" ""never have kids,"" ""nothing in my life."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans:** The phrase ""I finally decided to take the leap"" indicates a decision to act. While ""take the leap"" is metaphorical and doesn't specify a method, the word ""goodbye"" is a strong indicator of preparation or finality, which falls under the 'Behavior' definition's examples of ""means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent"" (e.g., ""getting my affairs in order,"" ""saying final goodbyes"").
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""I don't want to live."" This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent is present from step 2.
    *   The post mentions ""goodbye."" As per the 'Behavior' definition, ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent (e.g., 'I've written a suicide note', 'I just bought a rope', 'getting my affairs in order')"" includes preparations. Saying ""goodbye"" is a clear sign of making final preparations or ""getting affairs in order"" in the context of ending one's life. This constitutes an element of a plan. The phrase ""I finally decided to take the leap"" further reinforces the decision to act.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") and a clear desire to die (""I don't want to live""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes a clear sign of preparation (""goodbye"") in conjunction with the decision to act (""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself""). This element of preparation, falling under 'means' or 'getting affairs in order' as defined for 'Behavior', elevates it beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

116,"Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all. Playing witcher 3 before i call it quits. Honestly, i feel so relaxed that it's finally ending. 22 years on this earth was enough for me. Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""it's finally ending"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"", ""Goodbye"". These are direct expressions of intent to end life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""relaxed that it's finally ending"" (suggests a firm decision and acceptance), ""damaged beautiful people"" (suggests shared pain/understanding).
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: Not explicitly stated.
        - Means: Not explicitly stated.
        - Location: Not explicitly stated.
        - Specific timeframes: ""one last time before i end it all"" clearly indicates an imminent timeframe (after playing the game). ""finally ending"" reinforces this. ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"" implies a decision to end life at this point.
        - Preparations: ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" can be interpreted as a final activity or preparation. ""Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)"" is a clear farewell message, which is a strong sign of preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to end life (""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""it's finally ending"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""one last time before i end it all"" implies immediacy and a final act before the intended action.
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: The ""Goodbye"" message is a very strong indicator of preparation and intent to carry out the act. ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" also serves as a final, preparatory act.
    - These elements (specific timeframe and preparations) are sufficient to classify it as 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to end life (""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""it's finally ending""), so it is not 'Indicator'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - It contains clear elements of a plan: a specific, imminent timeframe (""one last time before i end it all"") and clear signs of preparation and farewell (""Goodbye""). This goes beyond mere 'Ideation' (thoughts without a plan) and fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

117,I need help. So I met this person on reddit who I am sort of friends with. But She wrote three days ago that she had tried to kill herself and she is now on restrictions at home. She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post states, ""She wrote three days ago that she had tried to kill herself"". This refers to a *friend*, not the person writing the post.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I need help,"" ""I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?"" These are expressions of concern and distress from the poster, but they are related to the friend's situation, not the poster's own suicidal feelings.
    *   Specific plans: None for the poster.
    *   Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: The post describes a past concrete action (""tried to kill herself"") taken by the *friend*, not the poster.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases *from the poster themselves*? No. The phrase ""tried to kill herself"" refers to the friend.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing *from the poster themselves*? No.
    *   Since the answer is 'No' to both for the poster, the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Not applicable, as the poster does not express suicidal intent or desire to die for themselves.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action *the poster* took to try to end their life? No. The action described was taken by the friend.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The core rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   The person writing the post expresses distress (""I need help,"" ""I'm scared"") and concern for a friend who has attempted suicide.
    *   However, the poster themselves does not express any suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, or past attempts for *themselves*.
    *   According to the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive..., it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'.""
    *   The poster's feelings of fear and needing help fall under ""general expressions of distress"" but do not indicate suicidal intent for the poster.
    *   Therefore, based on the poster's own words and the strict definitions, the post is an 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I will hang myself now,"" ""that will kill me with it,"" ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't want to be alone anymore,"" ""I've been alone since I was 5,"" ""haven't had a friend because of bullying,"" ""I only sit in my room alone everyday it makes me sick,"" ""I am scared to go out,"" ""nobody has ever liked me and just made fun of me and used me."" These indicate severe isolation, despair, worthlessness, and fear.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method:** ""hang myself"" (explicitly stated)
        *   **Means:** ""looking for something that I can tie"" (active search for means)
        *   **Timeframe:** ""now"" (immediate timeframe)
        *   **Preparations:** ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie"" (active preparation for the act)
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" refers to past self-harm, but it does not describe a *specific concrete action* taken to *attempt suicide*. It's a general statement about a coping mechanism.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""hang myself"" and ""that will kill me with it,"" clearly expressing a desire to die by suicide.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions:
        *   A specific **method**: ""hang myself.""
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie."" This indicates an active search for the means.
        *   A specific **timeframe**: ""now.""
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie.""
    *   The presence of a specific method, immediate timeframe, and active search for means strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a *specific past concrete action* the poster took to try to end their life. ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" is a general statement, not a description of a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal intent and a clear desire to die (""I will hang myself now,"" ""that will kill me with it""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by specifying a method (""hang myself""), an immediate timeframe (""now""), and active preparation/search for means (""looking for something that I can tie""). This precisely matches the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a specific past concrete action to end their life, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly falls under 'Behavior' due to the explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific method, immediate timeframe, and active preparation.

119,"I feel so shattered. I don't even know any more. I just feel shitty. There is no rhyme or reason. It's not even that I just want to die. I only feel just so very miserable (not sure if that is the right word to describe it) nothing more, nothing less, and it sucks. I can barely function. I don't even know how to just live anymore. It feels like I am being ripped apart and put back together incorrectly. I can't stop shaking. How am I supposed to live like this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This is a negation of suicidal intent or desire to die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""shattered,"" ""shitty,"" ""miserable,"" ""can barely function,"" ""ripped apart,"" ""can't stop shaking,"" ""How am I supposed to live like this?"" - These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and functional impairment.
    - Specific plans: None.
    - Past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. In fact, the post explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This directly negates a clear desire to die.
    - Since there are no explicit suicide terms AND no clear desire to die (and even a negation of it), the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no suicidal intent or desire to die expressed.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Not applicable, no past concrete actions described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant distress and difficulty coping (""shattered,"" ""miserable,"" ""can barely function"").
    - However, it explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This crucial phrase indicates a *lack* of a clear desire to die or end one's life.
    - According to the definitions:
        - 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life...""
        - 'Ideation' requires: ""...explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer...""
    - Since the post explicitly denies the desire to die, it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' or higher categories. It fits the 'Indicator' definition perfectly due to the high distress but absence of suicidal intent.

I am a hard worker but now I just don't see the need. Tf is this life? I want out.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I just want to kill myself."" It also uses phrases like ""I want out now"" and ""I want out,"" which, in the context of the preceding statement and overall distress, strongly imply a desire to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses significant distress, frustration, and hopelessness regarding work (""Hate this rat race,"" ""overwork me,"" ""can't handle it,"" ""don't see the need,"" ""Tf is this life?"").
    *   **Specific plans:** There is no mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""I just want to kill myself.""
    *   Yes, there are other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die (""I want out now,"" ""I want out"" in this context).
    *   Since there is an explicit mention of ""kill myself"" and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses suicidal intent, but it does *not* mention:
        *   A specific method (e.g., pills, jumping).
        *   Specific means being acquired or possessed.
        *   A specific location.
        *   A specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
        *   Clear signs of preparation (e.g., writing notes, giving away things).
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""I just want to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

121,"Are we going? AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE. It's the truth, you choose to not face the reality of the situation. You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (clear typo for ""DIE""), ""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicidal courage and determination"", ""Go out with bang, and big flames"" (implies a dramatic self-ending).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""DEPRESSED"", ""no skills valuable"", ""no purpose"", ""frightened of the idea"", ""Everyone hates themselves"".
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   ""With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem"" - suggests a method/means for causing harm, potentially leading to death.
        *   ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also."" - This is a very specific method (making explosives) and preparation (researching parts).
        *   ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best."" - This identifies a specific location and suggests an action intended to cause significant harm/destruction, which could be suicidal.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past actions are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (DIE), which is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die. It also explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"". Therefore, it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post has a clear desire to die (from step 2).
    *   Does it mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation?
        *   **Method/Means:** ""make nitroglycerin at home"", ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"" (for mayhem).
        *   **Preparation:** ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also."" This is a clear instruction for preparation.
        *   **Location:** ""one of the biggest power plants in your local area.""
        *   **Timeframe:** No specific timeframe is mentioned.
    *   Despite some of these being framed as general advice or commands (""you can produce"", ""Learn how to make"", ""Take a vacation""), the context of the post, which begins with ""I WANT TO DOIE"" and discusses suicidal thoughts, indicates these are concrete suggestions for *how* to end things dramatically. The specificity of making nitroglycerin and targeting a power plant, combined with the desire to die, points strongly to 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide are described in the post.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I WANT TO DOIE"") and mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe any past concrete actions, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The critical distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is suicidal thoughts/desire to die *without* a specific plan. 'Behavior' includes a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation).
    *   This post explicitly outlines methods (""make nitroglycerin"", ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters""), means (""parts for cheap""), preparation (""Learn how to make... research where to find the parts""), and a specific location (""biggest power plants in your local area"") in the context of ending one's life (""Go out with bang, and big flames"").

Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now.

With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The bully told the friend to ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself."" This is a direct mention of suicide, but it is a quote of what the *bully* said to the friend, not an expression of suicidal intent from the friend or the poster.
    - Emotional indicators: The friend is ""mentally disturbing,"" ""constantly tired,"" ""isn't doing well,"" ""really overwhelmed."" These indicate severe distress and potential mental health impact. The friend is also withdrawing (""won't eat and go out"").
    - Specific plans: None mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases *from the person writing the post or the person they are referring to as having suicidal intent*? No. The phrase ""go kill yourself"" is a quote from the bully directed at the friend, not an expression of the friend's or poster's own suicidal intent.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing *from the person writing the post or the person they are referring to as having suicidal intent*? No. While the friend is described as severely distressed and overwhelmed, there are no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" or ""I don't want to be here anymore"" attributed to the friend.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die expressed by the friend or the poster.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific past concrete actions taken to try to end life are described for the friend or the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post describes severe distress and mental disturbance in the friend due to bullying. The friend is showing signs like being tired, not eating, and not going out.
    - The crucial point is that the explicit mention of ""kill yourself"" is *attributed to the bully*, not expressed by the friend as their own desire or intent.
    - There is no clear expression of a desire to die or suicidal thoughts from the friend herself. The symptoms described (""mentally disturbing,"" ""constantly tired,"" ""isn't doing well,"" ""overwhelmed"") fall under ""general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life"" as per the 'Indicator' definition.
    - Since there is no explicit suicidal ideation or clear desire to die from the person at risk (the friend), it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide is on my mind everyday"", ""I want to hang myself so bad"", ""I really don't know how much longer I could last here on earth"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""loser, ugly, no motivation, isolated"", ""Alot of mental illness"", ""feel so alone"", ""nothing to look forward to"".
    - Specific plans: The post explicitly states ""I want to hang myself so bad"". This is a specific method. No specific timeframe beyond ""everyday"" or ""how much longer I could last"", no specific location or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described. ""I have tried to reach out"" refers to seeking help, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific **method**: Yes, ""I want to hang myself so bad"" clearly states a specific method (""hang myself"").
        - Specific means: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: No immediate specific timeframe, but ""everyday"" and ""how much longer I could last"" indicate ongoing intent. The ""at 21"" is a statement of current age, not a planned timeframe for the act.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - Since a specific method is mentioned, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post mentions ""I have tried to reach out"" but this is not a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 4, no specific past concrete attempt is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Based on Step 3, the post includes a clear desire to die and explicitly mentions a specific method (""I want to hang myself so bad""). This aligns directly with the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mention of a specific method.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""still alive unfortunately,"" ""I attempted once again,"" ""my 15th time,"" ""still want to attempt again.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""unfortunately"" (implies desire not to be alive), ""still want to attempt again"" (indicates ongoing suicidal desire).
    *   **Specific plans:** The post mentions ""still want to attempt again"" but then states ""I guess ill stay alive"" and does *not* provide any specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for a *current* suicide plan.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""last night I attempted once again,"" ""this makes it like what my 15th time?"" These are clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""attempted"" and ""still want to attempt again,"" which clearly indicate suicidal intent and a desire to die. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   While there is a desire to attempt again, the post does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for a *current* suicide. It says ""I guess ill stay alive"" indicating a pull back from immediate action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' based on a *current* plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly describes a specific past concrete action: ""last night I attempted once again,"" and ""this makes it like what my 15th time?"". This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' which requires a description of a specific past concrete action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes a ""specific past concrete action"" of attempting suicide (""last night I attempted once again,"" ""this makes it like what my 15th time?""). This is the strongest and most definitive element in the post.
    *   The 'Attempt' definition states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" In this case, it describes a past concrete action and also current ideation (""still want to attempt again""). The presence of the described concrete past action makes it 'Attempt'.

I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting and I know this is going to be another failure, I'm still too scared to go all the way through. I know I'll wake up later, and while I know this, I want so badly to reach out to my friends and ask them to check up on me but I don't want to put them through something as scary as this. I don't want them to have to deal with me during this. I knew this morning the moment I woke up that it would lead to this. I've thought about it all day and throughout I've tried to be happy and loud so they wouldn't worry, so they wouldn't know what I was really thinking. I'm scared right now but I know I'll wake up. I'm sad right now and I want nothing more than someone to sit with me in silence while I cry. But I'm alone. I can't reach out. So all I ask is this, please check up on me later. I can feel myself falling asleep, but as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up. I just want to be checked up on, but I don't want to bother my friends with it. Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post includes phrases like ""I'm at the end of my rope,"" ""I don't see a reason as for why,"" ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting and I know this is going to be another failure, I'm still too scared to go all the way through."" This strongly implies a current action with suicidal intent, which the user expects to ""fail."" The phrase ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"" is a direct wish for death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""end of my rope,"" ""Everything's crumbling,"" ""don't see a reason,"" ""scared,"" ""sad,"" ""alone.""
    *   **Specific plans:** No explicit future plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe) is stated for a *future* act. However, the post describes a *current* physical state that suggests an ongoing action (""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting and I can feel myself falling asleep""). The phrasing ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through"" implies a current action that is an attempt.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** The crucial phrase is ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" This is a clear description of a past concrete action (something they ""did before"" that caused them to ""fall asleep"" and then ""wake up"") which was a failed suicide attempt. The current situation is explicitly linked to this past experience (""I know this is going to be another failure"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   However, there is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die: ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" This indicates a clear desire to cease existing. The context of ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through"" also implies suicidal intent.
    *   *Conclusion for Step 2:* Yes, there is a clear desire to die. Therefore, it's more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   While there isn't a *future* plan, the post describes a *current* action: ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting and I can feel myself falling asleep."" This implies a method being used *now* to induce unconsciousness with the hope of not waking up. This could qualify as 'Behavior' based on the current action.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post explicitly states: ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" This is a clear description of a past concrete action taken to try to end their life, which they survived (""woke up""). The current state is framed as another instance of this ""failure.""
    *   The 'Attempt' definition states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" Here, we have a clear past concrete action described, and a current action that is an attempt (even if expected to fail).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It describes a current action with suicidal intent, which could lean towards 'Behavior'.
    *   Crucially, it explicitly describes a *past concrete action* that was a suicide attempt (""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up""). The 'Attempt' definition specifically covers cases where past attempts (describing a concrete action) are mentioned, especially when combined with current suicidal intent or actions. The current physical state described (""I feel my breath slowing down... falling asleep"") is directly linked to this past experience, implying a current attempt that mirrors past failed attempts. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""intent to kill myself,"" ""I could die,"" ""the attempt could fail,"" ""I am going to shoot myself,"" ""after I am done doing what I need to do,"" ""Goodbye.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, finality (""true failure,"" ""no more savings,"" ""my room is empty, everything is gone,"" ""Too late to turn back now!"", ""ran out of chances"").
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""shoot myself""

I hope you don't make mistakes like me. Please take care of yourselves. Please give yourselves chances."").
    - Past concrete actions: The post explicitly states ""I never did it"" regarding past intent, so no past concrete action is described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""shoot myself,"" and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die (""It's time,"" ""I am not giving myself anymore chances,"" ""Goodbye"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, the post mentions:
        - A specific **method**: ""shoot myself.""
        - Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: ""a loaded gun by my side.""
        - A specific **timeframe**: Implied immediacy (""It's time,"" ""Not until now,"" ""once I post this"").
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: ""Every other account is gone, deleted,"" ""no more savings, my room is empty, everything is gone,"" ""saying final goodbyes.""
    - These elements strongly indicate 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It explicitly states ""I never did it"" regarding past intent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - It explicitly includes a specific method (""shoot myself""), means (""loaded gun by my side""), a clear immediate timeframe, and extensive preparations (deleting accounts, emptying room, saying goodbyes). These elements align perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal episodes,"" ""leave a note for my parents saying its my last time with them,"" ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it,"" ""i thought that was the last breath i have.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depression,"" ""stress,"" ""feeling unappreciated,"" ""cry at midnight.""
    *   **Specific plans:** The post describes a past event, not a current plan. It mentions a note and a method (""bleach"") but in the context of a completed past action.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""a week ago... i had a suicide episode which made me leave a note for my parents saying its my last time with them and i had a lot of things hidden inside me, then i got to the bathroom grabbed the bleach and swallowed it, i thought that was the last breath i have but luckily i vomited."" This is a very clear and detailed description of a past concrete action taken to try to end their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""suicidal episodes"" and ""leave a note for my parents saying its my last time with them,"" and describes actions clearly intended to end life (""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it, i thought that was the last breath i have""). This is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post describes a *past* action (""a week ago""), not a *current* plan. While it details a method (swallowing bleach) and preparation (leaving a note), these are presented as completed actions from the past, not intentions for the future. Therefore, it does not fit the 'Behavior' definition which requires a *current* plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post explicitly describes a ""specific past concrete action"" the poster took to try to end their life: ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it, i thought that was the last breath i have but luckily i vomited."" It also mentions leaving a note as part of this past event. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly details a ""specific past concrete action"" taken by the poster to try to end their life (""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it""). This directly matches the definition for 'Attempt'. Even though the person states they are ""doing better now,"" the core content of the post is the description of this past attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I basically lost all will to live"" and ""I still want to die."" It also mentions ""the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child,"" implying their own potential death by suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse,"" ""lost all will to live,"" ""I still want to die,"" ""please help."" These indicate deep distress, hopelessness, and a desire for help.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any specific past actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. The phrases ""lost all will to live"" and ""I still want to die"" are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/not be alive.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**? No.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed? No.
        *   A specific **location**? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**? No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? No.
    *   Since no elements of a plan are mentioned, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post describes feelings (""lost all will to live"") but no specific actions taken.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I still want to die,"" ""lost all will to live""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, it does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    *   It also does not describe a past concrete action of attempting suicide, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thinking of suicide for months on end"", ""my end will only get nearer"", ""I'm fine with either outcome"" (referring to the potential end of life).
    - Emotional indicators: ""deepest depths of myself and darkest corners"", ""deeper than I've ever been"".
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or timeframe for suicide is mentioned. The mention of ""acid"" (LSD) is presented as a potential last resort or a test to see if it helps, not as a method of suicide. The phrasing ""I'd rather take a few tabs of acid and see what happens first , if it helps me then hey that's great , if it doesn't , I'll be back in the same spot or worse off than before and my end will only get nearer"" indicates that the LSD is an action *before* the potential ""end,"" and no method for that ""end"" is specified.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" (""thinking of suicide for months on end"") and clear expressions of wanting to die/cease existing (""my end will only get nearer"", ""I'm fine with either outcome""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal intent. Now, check for a plan:
        - Specific method for suicide? No. The LSD is not presented as the suicide method.
        - Specific means acquired/possessed with intent for suicide? No.
        - Specific location for suicide? No.
        - Specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No specific timeframe for the *suicide act* itself. ""My end will only get nearer"" is vague and conditional on the LSD not working.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since no specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide is mentioned, it does not fit 'Behavior'. The LSD use is a separate action, a test, not the suicide plan itself.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire for death (""thinking of suicide for months on end"", ""my end will only get nearer""). This means it is not 'Indicator'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The post does not contain any specific plan for suicide (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation for the act of suicide). The mention of LSD is a last resort to *avoid* the ""end,"" or a precursor to it, but not the method of suicide itself. Therefore, it lacks the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The post mentions stealing hydrocodone and drinking, but explicitly states it was ""just to feel ok for one night,"" not to self-harm or end life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""hit a new low,"" ""havent felt ok in a while,"" ""not sure what to do."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feeling overwhelmed.
    - Specific plans: None related to suicide. The plan mentioned is to use medication and alcohol ""to feel ok.""
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: None. The actions described (taking hydrocodone, drinking) are presented as current coping mechanisms ""to feel ok,"" not as past or current suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrases ""hit a new low,"" ""havent felt ok in a while,"" and ""not sure what to do"" express profound distress and feeling lost, but do not explicitly state a desire to die or not be alive. The act of taking medication is stated as an attempt to ""feel ok,"" which is contrary to suicidal intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Since there is no suicidal intent or desire to die expressed, this step is not applicable for classifying as 'Behavior'. The use of substances is explicitly for feeling ""ok,"" not as a method for suicide.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The actions described are current (""tonight"") and are stated as an attempt to ""feel ok,"" not as a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses significant emotional distress, a ""new low,"" and a feeling of not being ""ok."" It describes a problematic coping mechanism (misusing prescription medication and alcohol).
    - However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide, self-harm with suicidal intent, or any clear desire to die or cease existing. The stated purpose of the substance use was to ""feel ok,"" which indicates a desire to alleviate distress, not to end life.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (no clear desire to die), 'Behavior' (no plan for suicide), or 'Attempt' (no past concrete suicide action).
    - It aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive... it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'."" This post expresses distress but not a desire not to be alive.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I see no point in living anymore"" is a clear expression of a desire to cease living.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, isolation (""I don't have any friends,"" ""Nothing in my life is working out"").
    - Specific plans: None mentioned. No method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life"": No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: Yes, ""I see no point in living anymore"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to cease existing/not be alive.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die/not be alive, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No.
        - Specific means: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: No.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - There are no elements of a plan, method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life: No. The post describes current feelings and thoughts, not past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, the post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""I see no point in living anymore""), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 3, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation), so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes... a clear desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., 'I want it to be over') but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow."" This is a direct reference to a self-harming action with lethal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""fucked up,"" ""guilty,"" ""sorry.""
    - Specific plans: ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is a specific method and means. ""might not wake up tomorrow"" implies a specific timeframe (tonight/before tomorrow).
    - Past concrete actions: The phrasing ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is in the present perfect tense, indicating an action that has just occurred or is ongoing, with the outcome (""might not wake up tomorrow"") still pending. It does not describe a completed, failed past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - While the exact words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used, the phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow"" is an unambiguous expression of an action taken with the clear desire to die/not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, building on the clear desire to die, the post explicitly mentions:
        - A specific **method**: ""taken a fuck load of pills.""
        - Specific **means**: ""pills.""
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""might not wake up tomorrow.""
    - These elements strongly indicate 'Behavior'. The action described is the execution of a plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a *past concrete action* that was completed and survived (e.g., ""I overdosed last year and survived""). Instead, it describes an action that has just happened or is currently happening, with the outcome still uncertain (""might not wake up tomorrow""). This is not a historical 'Attempt' but a current or very recent execution of a plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die through the action described, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires (Ideation) by describing a specific action (taking pills) which constitutes a method and means, with an implied timeframe.
    - The description ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow"" perfectly fits the definition of 'Behavior' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/a desire to die AND mentions a specific method/means and timeframe for carrying out suicide. It is not a past, completed attempt but an ongoing or very recent action with an uncertain outcome.

133,"I'm planning out my suicide and I have no intention of anyone stopping me and to be saved. I don't want to tell anyone personally in my life. I want to continue being their idea of 'normal' and 'casual', unbeknownst to them. I have an intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest. I'm tired of the constant struggle and have a fear of failing an attempt once again. I intend to do it right this time and not make those around me suffer with the blatant telling of my suicidal thoughts. I will not usher my burden into anyone else and will just silently reminisce with these feelings and my thoughts. I will go through with this, for I can't find a reason nor can I create one to continue living. I'm so proud of the people who can and do push through their suicidal thoughts and depression. I am and will not be one of those people.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""planning out my suicide,"" ""no intention of anyone stopping me and to be saved,"" ""fear of failing an attempt once again,"" ""intend to do it right this time,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I will go through with this,"" ""can't find a reason nor can I create one to continue living.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of the constant struggle,"" ""can't find a reason nor can I create one to continue living.""
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method/Means/Location:** Not explicitly stated.
        *   **Specific timeframes:** ""in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest."" This is a very specific timeframe.
        *   **Preparations:** ""planning out my suicide"" indicates planning, but not a concrete preparatory action like writing a note or acquiring means.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""fear of failing an attempt once again."" This phrase strongly implies a past concrete action that was a suicide attempt and it failed. The phrase ""an attempt"" refers to a specific past action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" and a clear desire to die (""can't find a reason nor can I create one to continue living,"" ""I will go through with this"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post mentions a specific timeframe for the act: ""in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest."" This qualifies as a plan element for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action: ""fear of failing an attempt once again."" The phrase ""failing an attempt"" describes what they *did* in the past (an attempt) and its outcome (it failed). This is a description of a past concrete action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation and a desire to die (ruling out 'Indicator').
    *   It contains a specific timeframe for a future act (""January 1st""), which would qualify it for 'Behavior'.
    *   However, it also explicitly refers to a past concrete action: ""fear of failing an attempt once again."" The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" Since both a past concrete attempt is mentioned and current planning/intent is present, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification according to the provided rules.

For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""do not want to live anymore"", ""scared to kill myself"", ""hate being alive"", ""should just do it now"", ""wish i was never born"".
    - Emotional indicators: hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden (""weigh down my family and friends"").
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or preparations are mentioned. While ""now"" is mentioned, it's in the context of ""sometimes i wonder if i should just do it now"" and immediately contrasted with ""i am to scared to kill myself"" and ""For now i guess i will just sit here"", indicating no concrete plan or intent to act *now*.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and clearly expresses a desire to die (""do not want to live anymore"", ""hate being alive"", ""wish i was never born"").
    - This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal intent.
    - Does it mention a specific method? No.
    - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
    - A specific location? No.
    - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? While ""now"" is mentioned, it's a contemplation (""sometimes i wonder if I should just do it now"") rather than a firm plan, and is immediately contradicted by ""i am to scared to kill myself"" and ""For now i guess i will just sit here"". This does not meet the criteria for a *specific timeframe for the act* in the 'Behavior' definition, which implies intent to act.
    - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there is no specific plan (method, means, location, or concrete timeframe for action/preparation), it does not fit 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive (""do not want to live anymore"", ""scared to kill myself"", ""hate being alive"", ""should just do it now""). This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition.
    - It lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, concrete timeframe for action, or preparations), which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. The mention of ""now"" is a thought, not a committed plan, especially given the stated fear and inaction (""For now i guess i will just sit here"").
    - There are no descriptions of past concrete actions, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

135,"i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die. Does anyone else do this?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""attempt suicide"" and ""hang myself."" It also mentions ""don't die,"" indicating the intent was to die, even if the action was interrupted or ambivalent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The act itself implies severe distress, a struggle with suicidal ideation, and possibly ambivalence (""half heartedly"").
    *   **Specific plans:** The post describes a *repeated past action* (""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself...""). It does not describe a *future* plan to commit suicide.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** Yes, ""i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die."" This is a very specific, concrete action taken with suicidal intent, even if it's described as ""half-hearted"" and interrupted.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of ""attempt suicide"" and ""hang myself,"" which are direct phrases related to suicide.
    *   This confirms it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post describes what the user *does* or *has done* (""i hang myself frequently""), not a *current or future plan* they intend to carry out. While hanging is a method, the context is about past/habitual actions, not a future intention. Therefore, it does not fit the 'Behavior' definition of a *current* plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post clearly describes a ""specific past concrete action"" the poster took to try to end their life: ""i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die."" This fits the definition of an 'Attempt', particularly the example ""when I tried to hang myself it didn't work."" The ""frequently"" indicates these are repeated past actions. The ""half-heartedly"" and the fact they ""don't die"" describe the nature of these attempts (interrupted/failed), but they are still described as attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""attempt suicide"" and describes a ""specific past concrete action"" (""i hang myself"") taken with suicidal intent, even if the outcome was not death. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'. It is not 'Indicator' because of explicit suicide terms. It is not 'Ideation' because it describes concrete actions, not just thoughts or desires. It is not 'Behavior' because it describes past/habitual actions rather than a current or future plan.

136,"I wanna move anymore. hey. You don't know me but I figured I could let things out here, my family just had a huge fight over all of our problems and stuff. I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for. Hold on to them. Because life is temporary. And from what I've learned, not everybody gets the happy ending",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now"" - Direct mention of a suicidal state.
        *   ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out."" - Direct description of a past suicide attempt, including survival.
        *   ""After that I had a few close calls but never succeed."" - Vague reference to past near-attempts.
        *   ""I see no point anymore"" - Expression of hopelessness and desire to end distress.
        *   ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"" - Clear desire to cease living.
        *   ""it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me."" - Implies a readiness to end life.
        *   ""Life is temporary. And from what I've learned, not everybody gets the happy ending"" - Reflects on mortality and lack of hope.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, loneliness, feeling stuck, pain.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for a *current* suicide plan are mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out."" This is a clear, specific description of a past concrete action taken to end their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""suicidal"" and ""had an attempt.""
    *   Yes, there are clear expressions of wanting to die/not go on (""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" ""this world's just not meant for me"").
    *   This indicates the post is more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   While there is clear suicidal intent/desire to die, the post *does not* mention a specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping""), specific means being acquired (e.g., ""bought a rope""), a specific location (e.g., ""that bridge""), a specific timeframe for a *current* act (e.g., ""tonight""), or clear preparations (e.g., ""writing a note""). The ""close calls"" are vague and past, not current plans. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post explicitly states: ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out."" This is a clear description of a ""specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life,"" which directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'. The phrase ""barely made it out"" confirms it was a serious, life-threatening action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal language and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a *current* specific plan, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   It explicitly describes a ""specific past concrete action"" taken to end their life (""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out""). This fits the definition of 'Attempt' perfectly. The presence of a described past attempt takes precedence over current ideation in classification, as per the 'Attempt' definition.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
    - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm (direct and indirect language). There are none.
    - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, anhedonia, etc.). The phrase ""I am 29 still live with my parents"" combined with ""fuckkkkkkkk"" and random characters suggests significant frustration, distress, or agitation. However, it does not explicitly convey hopelessness, despair, or worthlessness in a suicidal context. The random characters could imply extreme emotional dysregulation or a breakdown in communication, but not necessarily suicidal intent.
    - Look for specific plans: methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations. None are present.
    - Check for clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. None are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. While there is clear distress (""fuckkkkkkkk""), there is no statement like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" or ""I want it all to end."" The random characters do not convey a clear desire to die.
    - Since 'No' to both, the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no suicidal intent/desire to die present. There are no mentions of method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Not applicable, as there is no description of a specific past concrete action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, and strictly following the definitions, which category fits best?
    - The post expresses general distress and frustration (""I am 29 still live with my parents. fuckkkkkkkk"") but lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide and lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. It fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it contains general expressions of distress or dissatisfaction with life, without indicating self-inflicted intent or a wish to cease living.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit suicidal thought or clear desire to not be alive.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no suicidal intent/desire to die and no plan.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as there is no description of a past concrete action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself"" (direct), ""die in my sleep"" (desire to die), ""start cutting again"" (self-harm, potentially suicidal).
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, strong desire to end life.
    - Specific plans: ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" (specific method identified and refined). ""One of these days I'll finally do it,"" and ""I'll break killing myself regardless"" indicate future intent, despite ""too much potential interference"" currently.
    - Past concrete actions: ""I've done it many times"" is mentioned, but it's vague and doesn't describe a *specific concrete action* (e.g., ""I took pills last Tuesday""). ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" implies past attempts that were not ""proper"" or successful, leading to learning, but it doesn't *describe* a specific past action in the way required for the 'Attempt' definition. ""start cutting again"" implies past cutting, but again, no specific past concrete action to end life is described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, ""killing myself"" is explicit.
    - Yes, ""I just wish I could die in my sleep instead"" is a clear desire to die.
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - Does the post mention:
        - A specific **method**: Yes, ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" explicitly names a method (hanging) and indicates a refined understanding of how to perform it.
        - Specific **means**: Not explicitly acquired, but implied by the method.
        - A specific **location**: No.
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""One of these days I'll finally do it"" is vague, but ""at the moment there is too much potential interference"" and ""I'll break killing myself regardless"" indicates a plan that is temporarily stalled but still intended for the future.
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" can be interpreted as mental preparation or having acquired the knowledge for the method.
    - Since a specific method is identified and understood (""figured out how to properly hang myself""), this meets the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life?
    - ""I've done it many times"" is too vague to meet the 'Attempt' definition. It doesn't describe *what* they did.
    - ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" implies past *unsuccessful* attempts at hanging, but it does not *describe* a specific past concrete action (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself last week and almost succeeded""). It's about current knowledge for a future act.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the strict definition of 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""killing myself,"" ""wish I could die"").
    - It explicitly mentions a specific method (""figured out how to properly hang myself"") for a future act, which falls under the 'Behavior' definition of a plan.
    - While there are references to past actions (""done it many times,"" ""start cutting again""), they are not described with the specificity required for the 'Attempt' category (i.e., a concrete action taken to try to end their life). The primary focus regarding the method is on current understanding for future execution.
    - Thus, the post best fits 'Behavior' due to the clear intent and the presence of a specific, refined method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all."" This is an indirect but clear expression of a desire to cease existing/die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""don't know if I'm feeling too alright,"" ""feeling doomed,"" ""as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing.""
    - Specific plans: None mentioned (no method, means, location, specific timeframe for action, or preparations). The ""over the course of a year"" refers to the duration of the thoughts, not a plan timeframe.
    - Past concrete actions: None described. The post mentions ""thoughts"" over a year, not actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? ""end it all"" is a very strong, unambiguous expression of wanting to end one's life.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all"" clearly indicates a desire to cease existing/die.
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die/cease existing. This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Conclusion: No specific plan elements are present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post refers to ""thoughts"" over a year, not a concrete action taken.
    - Conclusion: No past concrete attempt described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's a clear desire to ""end it all.""
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation) mentioned.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no specific past concrete action to end their life is described.
    - The post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""end it all"") and describes having suicidal thoughts, but without any specific plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang.

Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful. I am a useless piece of garbage. Oh wait, garbage can be recycled or made into something. My miserable ass is is as useless as the shit that comes out of it.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" and ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in."" These are clear descriptions of past self-harming behaviors intended to end life. The phrase ""Why should I still live and waste the resources"" indicates a questioning of the value of life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Suffering from depression and anxiety,"" ""hate the line of career,"" ""hate the stupid decisions,"" ""no meaningful friends,"" ""no ambitions and goals,"" ""my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell,"" ""I hate myself,"" ""fuck up whom nobody would ever like,"" ""Useless, shameless, pathetic loser,"" ""miserable ass is is as useless as the shit that comes out of it."" These show profound hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and self-loathing.
    *   **Specific plans:** There are no specific plans (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations) mentioned for a *future* suicide attempt. The actions described are explicitly in the past.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** Yes, ""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" and ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor"" are concrete actions taken to attempt suicide, even though the poster states they ""chickened out each time,"" implying the attempts were not completed or successful. The definition of 'Attempt' covers actions taken to try to end one's life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   While there isn't explicit use of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" for *current* intent, the questioning ""Why should I still live"" and the detailed descriptions of past attempts clearly indicate a desire to die or end one's life, or at least a history of such desires leading to action. The primary focus for classification here shifts to the past concrete actions.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   There is no mention of a *current* specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for a *future* suicide attempt. All described actions are in the past.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post unequivocally describes specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life: ""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor."" These directly fit the definition of 'Attempt' which focuses on ""specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life."" The fact that they ""chickened out"" means the *action* was initiated as an attempt, even if not completed.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear expressions of distress and self-loathing, but more importantly, it details multiple specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'Indicator' is too low, as there's clear desire not to live and past actions.
        *   'Ideation' is insufficient because specific past concrete actions are described, not just thoughts or desires.
        *   'Behavior' requires a *current* plan, which is not present. The actions described are explicitly historical.
        *   'Attempt' is defined as content describing ""one or more specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life."" The post perfectly matches this definition with ""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" and ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states ""Living is not for me,"" ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old,"" ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself,"" and ""I might actually get the courage to do it."" These are direct mentions of suicide and a desire to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""frustrating,"" ""crippling anxiety,"" ""sensitive af,"" ""relationship with my mom sucks,"" ""burned out.""
    *   **Specific plans:** There are no mentions of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations. The statement ""I might actually get the courage to do it"" indicates a strengthening resolve, but not a concrete plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The phrase ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old"" is a hypothetical statement about past ideation/desire, not a description of a concrete action taken to attempt suicide. It implies they *did not* act because it was too hard.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly uses the term ""suicide"" and ""kill myself."" It also expresses a clear desire not to be alive (""Living is not for me""). This confirms the post is more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses suicidal intent (from Step 2).
    *   However, it does *not* mention a specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping""), specific means being acquired, a specific location, a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or any preparations (e.g., ""writing notes""). The increasing confidence to ""do it"" does not equate to a plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does *not* describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. The statement about being gone at 15 is hypothetical, indicating a past desire, not an action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan.

142,Too much. Well it finally happened I got to the point where the pain is too much and the 'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better. I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""be dead in less than 24 hours,"" ""pain is too much,"" ""if you wanted to die you would"" (implies suicidal thoughts).
    - Emotional indicators: ""the pain is too much.""
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: Overdosing with ""Trazodone and alcohol.""
        - Means: ""I have enough Trazodone,"" ""will get alcohol today.""
        - Timeframe: ""in less than 24 hours.""
        - Preparations: Acquiring alcohol today.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of a past concrete action to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The phrase ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" combined with the method and means clearly expresses a desire to die by self-inflicted means. Yes.
    - Since there's a clear desire to die, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific **method**: Overdosing with Trazodone and alcohol. (Yes)
        - Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: ""enough Trazodone,"" ""will get alcohol today."" (Yes)
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""in less than 24 hours."" (Yes)
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: ""will get alcohol today."" (Yes)
    - Since multiple elements of a specific plan are present, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It refers to a current plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""be dead in less than 24 hours"").
    - It contains a specific plan including method (Trazodone + alcohol), means (has Trazodone, will get alcohol), and a specific timeframe (""less than 24 hours"").
    - There is no description of a past concrete action.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

Out of the whole year, I probably have 2 good months then the rest is just darkness. My sister just gave birth to my first nephew on June 3rd. My birthday is on the 14th of this month as well. I should be happy, but I'm not. I really am tired of my obsessive negative thoughts. I've been struggling since I was a child, and it's been so long since I've been happy. Nothing makes sense anymore, I want to give up. Even typing this, I feel guilty for feeling this way. The only one who is bringing myself pain is me- telling myself negative things every day. All of the abuse and shit I've experienced is in the past, and I'm still allowing it to control me. Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives? I bring nothing to the table. Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No direct mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""self-harm.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""darkness,"" ""tired of my obsessive negative thoughts,"" ""struggling since I was a child,"" ""so long since I've been happy,"" ""Nothing makes sense anymore,"" ""I want to give up,"" ""guilty for feeling this way,"" ""bringing myself pain,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"", ""I bring nothing to the table. Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and a desire to cease current suffering/existence.
    - Specific plans: No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life"": No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: Yes. Phrases like ""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"", ""My life has no worth. No meaning."" clearly convey a desire to cease existing or not be alive. ""I want to give up"" in this context of deep despair implies giving up on life. The questioning of their existence and the declaration of life having ""no worth. No meaning."" are strong expressions of a desire to not continue. This is beyond general distress and indicates a clear desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No.
        - Specific means: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: No.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - Since there are no elements of a plan, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life: No. The mention of ""All of the abuse and shit I've experienced is in the past"" refers to past trauma, not a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to ""give up"" and questions the very purpose and worth of their existence (""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"", ""My life has no worth. No meaning.""). This constitutes a clear desire to not be alive, as per the 'Ideation' definition (""a clear desire to not be alive any longer"").
    - There are no specific elements of a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation).
    - There is no description of a past concrete suicide attempt.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to let myself pass away"", ""finally kill me"", ""slowly kill myself"", ""I'm going to die"", ""when I die"". These are direct and indirect expressions of self-inflicted death.
    - Emotional indicators: The desire to die, the specific and extreme method (anorexia to the point of being a ""skeleton""), and the thought of giving others time to adjust, all indicate severe distress, despair, and a clear intent to end life.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""anorexia"", ""slowly kill myself this way"". This is a specific method (starvation).
        - Means: The goal weight of ""78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me"" indicates a specific target/means for achieving the lethal outcome.
        - Location: Not mentioned.
        - Timeframes: ""slowly kill myself this way"", ""give people plenty of time to adjust"". While not a precise date, this describes a deliberate, ongoing process with a clear lethal endpoint, which constitutes a timeframe for the planned action.
        - Preparations: ""give people plenty of time to adjust and accept the idea that I'm going to die"" can be seen as a form of psychological preparation for others, linked to the plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""kill me"", ""kill myself"", and clear desires to die (""I'm going to let myself pass away"", ""I'm going to die"").
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific **method**: ""anorexia"", ""slowly kill myself this way"". This is a clear method of self-harm intended to be lethal.
        - Specific **means**: The ""new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me"" explicitly links a specific, measurable goal (weight) to the lethal intent. This acts as a specific means.
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""slowly kill myself this way"" and ""give people plenty of time to adjust"" describes an ongoing, deliberate process towards death, which serves as a timeframe.
    - Since there are clear elements of a specific method, means, and timeframe for carrying out the suicide, this strongly points to 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. It describes a current and future plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and to commit suicide (""let myself pass away"", ""kill me"", ""slowly kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post does not describe a past concrete attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by outlining a specific plan:
        - A specific method (starvation via anorexia).
        - A specific goal/means (reaching a lethal weight, ""78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me"").
        - An implied timeframe for this process (""slowly kill myself this way"", ""give people plenty of time to adjust"").
    - These elements align perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

    - It also mentions a specific **method**: ""charcoal bbq"" (implying carbon monoxide poisoning).
    - It also mentions a specific **location**: ""in a tent.""

I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault."" This is a clear expression of a desire to die. However, it immediately follows with a crucial negation: ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" This indicates a passive desire to die, or a feeling that death would be a relief, rather than an active intent to self-harm. The post also includes ""I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me,"" which suggests a wish to cease existing for the benefit of others, but not necessarily an active plan to cause one's own death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness (""not worth it,"" ""only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life,"" ""I don't think I'll escape it,"" ""I don't think I'll ever be good enough""), despair, worthlessness (""everything about me is wrong,"" ""self loathing,"" ""don't deserve anything,"" ""an embarrassment""), and self-blame (""my own fault"").
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of specific methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post contains the phrase ""want want to die,"" which is a clear expression of a desire to die.
    *   However, this is immediately qualified by ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" This explicitly states a *lack of current intent* to carry out the act of suicide.
    *   According to the 'Ideation' definition, ""a clear desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., 'I want to die')"" qualifies for Ideation. The negation ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" indicates that while the *desire* is present, the *active intent to act* is not. This is consistent with passive suicidal ideation. The 'Indicator' definition states: ""If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive (e.g., 'I hate living,' 'I want to disappear,' 'I wish I wouldn't wake up'), it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'."" The phrase ""want to die"" falls into this category, even with the subsequent negation of active intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation is mentioned. The explicit statement ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" further confirms the absence of a plan or intent to act.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (""want want to die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator', which is for general distress without a clear desire to die.
    *   While the post explicitly states ""I don't feel like actually committing die,"" this clarifies the *lack of current intent to act* on the desire, but it does not negate the *presence of the desire itself*. This is characteristic of passive suicidal ideation.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations), so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category, as it captures the presence of suicidal thoughts/desire without a plan or active intent to act.

    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. The phrases ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying"" are clear and unambiguous expressions of a desire to cease existing.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No. The post expresses a desire to die but provides no details of how, when, or where this might occur, nor any signs of preparation.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There are no descriptions of past actions like ""I overdosed"" or ""I tried to cut myself.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Based on Step 2, the post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" ""I just feel like dying""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Based on Step 3, there is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   Based on Step 4, there is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around."" - This implies a deadline for life, suggesting that if things don't improve, something drastic will happen.
        *   ""But I can't do it anymore."" - Expresses extreme distress and a desire to give up.
        *   ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down."" - Metaphorical language for suicide, comparing self to a sick animal that needs to be euthanized.
        *   ""It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down."" - Explicitly links the ""put down"" metaphor to self-inflicted action, clearly indicating suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Tiredness, despair, feeling like an ""abomination,"" ""What is wrong with me,"" feelings of worthlessness (""My trauma isn't bad enough,"" ""I want it to happen just to feel valid"").
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around."" - This is a specific timeframe for a potential suicidal act, contingent on whether things improve. This fits the definition of a ""specific timeframe"" for carrying out suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past concrete suicide attempts are described. The post mentions past trauma but not actions taken to end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit use of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   However, there are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/cease existing: ""But I can't do it anymore"" combined with the extended metaphor of ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the 'dog' put itself down."" This metaphor clearly conveys a desire to end one's own life. Yes, there is a clear desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post mention:
        *   A specific **method**? No.
        *   Specific **means**? No.
        *   A specific **location**? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide? YES. ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around."" This sets a conditional deadline for the suicidal act, making it a specific timeframe.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? No.
    *   Since a specific timeframe (""3 weeks"") is mentioned in the context of the metaphorical ""put down"" (suicide), this indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I can't do it anymore,"" ""put itself down""), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes a specific timeframe (""3 weeks"") for this decision/action, which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' (a plan including a specific timeframe).
    *   It does not describe a past concrete attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because the specific timeframe constitutes a planning element, even if the method isn't explicit. The ""3 weeks"" acts as a conditional deadline for the suicidal intent.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I know there are hotlines, and people who would help me. I really, really appreciate that. Thank you for your time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" ""suicide pact,"" ""my demise,"" ""I don't think I would do 'it'"" (referring to suicide).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""slump and horrid hole of thoughts,"" ""torment of thoughts,"" ""tired,"" ""delicate,"" ""cannot stand being weak,"" ""feel different,"" ""not able to connect,"" ""hate the lingering emotional aftermath."" These clearly indicate distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   ""I have been 'plotting' my suicide seriously on and off for months."" - This indicates past and intermittent planning.
        *   ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" - This is a concrete preparation.
        *   ""I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so."" - Implies consideration of the aftermath, a planning element.
        *   ""I would never use a weapon from my household."" - Implies consideration of methods/means, even if ruling them out.
        *   *Crucially, the post also states contradictory information regarding current intent:* ""Today, I feel better."" ""I am out of my hole for now."" ""I don't think I would do 'it'."" This suggests that while planning has occurred, it is not currently active or intended to be acted upon.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** None described. ""Plotting"" is not an action taken, but a thought process.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" and ""my demise.""
    *   It also expresses a clear desire not to be alive: ""I just can't 'click' into life.""
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post mentions elements of planning: ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months,"" ""Yesterday, I drafted my will,"" consideration of how the body would be found, and ruling out certain means.
    *   However, the definition of 'Behavior' requires a plan *to commit suicide* or self-harming behavior *intended to lead to suicide*. The post explicitly states, ""Today, I feel better. I am out of my hole for now. I don't think I would do 'it'."" This indicates that while there have been periods of planning and preparation (like drafting the will yesterday), there is no *current* intent to act on these plans. The post is asking a question about the *feeling* of obligation from past/intermittent suicidal thoughts and planning, not stating a current intent to execute a plan. The planning elements are discussed in a historical or hypothetical context, not as an active, intended plan. The guideline states: ""If suicidal intent/desire to die is present, but you are genuinely uncertain about the presence of an explicit plan... choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Given the explicit statement ""I don't think I would do 'it',"" the current intent for action is uncertain/negated.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific past concrete action to end their life is described. ""Plotting"" is not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions and clear desire to die.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' as no specific past concrete action is described.
    *   It comes down to 'Ideation' vs. 'Behavior'. While the post mentions past ""plotting"" and a recent preparation (drafting a will), it explicitly states, ""I don't think I would do 'it',"" and ""I am out of my hole for now."" This negates the presence of a *currently active and intended* plan, which is crucial for 'Behavior'. The post is primarily about the *thoughts* and *feelings* surrounding suicide and past planning, rather than a present intent to act on a plan. Therefore, it fits 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No direct mentions of suicide, self-harm, death, or dying.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i hate tough love,"" ""stressed,"" ""feel like he would be better off without me"" (suggests feeling like a burden/worthless), ""not in a good mood,"" ""brings me anxiety,"" ""criticized and mocked for feeling depressed,"" ""sick of this endless myopic bouts of 'criticism',"" ""abused enough at home,"" ""i don't need this shit among my friends,"" ""i want it to stop,"" ""if i leave them i have no one"" (suggests isolation/hopelessness about social support).
    *   **Specific plans:** None. No method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** None described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing?
        *   ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" - This expresses feelings of being a burden or worthlessness, which is a risk factor and an emotional indicator, but it is *not* a direct or unambiguous expression of the poster's desire to die or end their own life. It's about *others* being better off.
        *   ""i want it to stop"" - Refers to the abuse/criticism, not life itself.
        *   ""if i leave them i have no one"" - Expresses fear of isolation, not a desire to die.
    *   Since there are no explicit suicide terms AND no other clear, unambiguous desire to die expressed, the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):** Not applicable, as no clear desire to die was identified in step 2.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:** Not applicable, as no past concrete action was identified.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:** The post clearly expresses significant distress, feelings of worthlessness (""feel like he would be better off without me""), and social isolation (""if i leave them i have no one""). These are strong indicators of mental health struggles and potential suicide risk. However, it does not contain explicit suicide language nor a clear, unambiguous statement of wanting to die or end one's life. The phrase ""feel like he would be better off without me"" fits the 'Indicator' definition's example of ""I feel worthless."" It does not cross the threshold into 'Ideation' which requires a clear desire to not be alive (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living""). Therefore, it best fits 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No direct mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or self-harm. There is a phrase ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally,"" which is directed at another person, implying a wish for *their* absence or death, not the poster's own.
    - Emotional indicators: Extreme anger (""FUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCFFFKKKKKKKK YOUUUUU. fuck you fuck you fuck you FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU. i fucking hate you. FUCK YOU""), exhaustion (""i'm so tired,"" ""no more energy to deal with this anymore""), despair/hopelessness about the world (""the world is just fucked in every single way.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. While the poster expresses extreme exhaustion and despair with their situation and the world, they do not state ""I want to die,"" ""I want to end my life,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" or similar phrases indicating a desire for *their own* death. The anger and frustration are directed outwards.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no clear suicidal intent or desire to die from the poster.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses intense distress, anger, exhaustion, and a sense of hopelessness about the world and a specific situation/person.
    - It does *not* contain any explicit suicide mentions or a clear, unambiguous desire for the poster to die or end their own life. The emotional state is one of extreme frustration and despair, but not suicidal ideation.
    - This fits the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., 'life sucks,' 'I'm so unhappy,' 'I feel worthless,' 'I'm struggling').""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I don't want to kill myself."" There are no other direct or indirect mentions of suicide or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""literally nothing going for me,"" ""pushed all my friends away,"" ""barely leave the house anymore,"" ""sick of sitting inside all day,"" ""nothing is going to change,"" ""so stagnant,"" ""sick of _this_ life,"" ""world rejects me at every turn,"" ""don't know what's next for me,"" ""walls are closing in and there's no escape."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, isolation, and feeling trapped.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post contains the phrase ""I don't want to kill myself,"" which is a *negation* of explicit suicidal intent.
    *   There are no other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore""). The phrase ""I'm sick of _this_ life"" is distinct from ""I'm sick of *life*"" or ""I want to die."" The user also expresses a desire to ""give life a chance"" and lists things they want to achieve (job, financial independence, girlfriend, hobbies). The feeling of ""walls closing in and there's no escape"" refers to their current life situation, not a desire to end their life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die, this step is not applicable for classifying as 'Behavior'. Even if it were, there are no elements of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation).

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""I don't want to kill myself."" This immediately rules out 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' which require explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to die.
    *   The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with current life circumstances (""sick of _this_ life,"" ""nothing going for me,"" ""walls are closing in""). This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive... it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'.""
    *   The post does not express a clear desire not to be alive; rather, it expresses a desire for life to change and to ""give life a chance."" Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate classification.

I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts and ideations"", ""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""overwhelming and difficult"", ""in a rut"", ""too weak and pathetic"", ""can't get myself to do anything anymore"", ""very small support system"".
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is detailed. ""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" is vague but could imply a final farewell or celebration.
        - Means: Not mentioned.
        - Location: Not mentioned.
        - Specific timeframe: ""tomorrow while my mom is out with family"". This is a clear, specific timeframe.
        - Preparations: ""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" could be interpreted as a form of preparation (saying goodbyes, getting affairs in order in a social sense).
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""suicidal thoughts and ideations"" and ""I want to kill myself"".
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die expressed: ""I want to die tomorrow"".
    - Since there are explicit mentions and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), the post mentions:
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""tomorrow while my mom is out with family"". This explicitly meets the criteria for 'Behavior'.
        - Potential **preparation**: ""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" could be seen as preparing for the act by saying goodbyes or having a final experience.
    - Since a specific timeframe is present, this indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. It discusses current thoughts and a future timeframe.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""suicidal thoughts and ideations"", ""I want to kill myself"") and a clear desire to die (""I want to die tomorrow""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - Crucially, it includes a specific timeframe for the intended act (""tomorrow while my mom is out with family""). The 'Behavior' definition states that a plan MUST include one or more of the listed elements, and a ""specific timeframe"" is one of them. The potential preparation (""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"") further supports the 'Behavior' classification.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Because a specific timeframe is mentioned, it goes beyond mere 'Ideation' and falls into 'Behavior'.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""dead inside"", ""yeet myself way too much"". ""Yeet myself"" in this context, following expressions of extreme despair and feeling ""beyond saving"", strongly implies a desire for self-harm or suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""useless life"", ""huge depressive episode"", ""dead inside"", ""still sad"", ""still anhedonic"", ""beyond saving"", ""want to cry"". These indicate severe hopelessness and despair.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. ""Yeet myself"" is a general desire, not a specific plan element.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly with those exact words.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. The phrase ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"" combined with ""dead inside"" and ""I must be beyond saving"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of a desire to self-harm or end one's life. ""Yeet myself"" is a colloquial but clear indicator of a desire for self-inflicted harm or suicide in this context of distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): The post does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means being acquired, a specific location, a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or clear preparations. ""Yeet myself"" expresses a desire but lacks the specificity of a plan.
    - Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post describes current feelings and desires (""I just want to cry and yeet myself"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, the post contains a clear desire to self-harm/end life (""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"" in a context of profound despair and feeling ""beyond saving""). This means it is more than 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 3, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation) mentioned. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    - Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The post expresses a clear desire to self-harm/end life without a specific plan, which aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

    - Emotional indicators: ""i fucked up this time,"" ""God im such a fucking loser,"" ""i could really use someone to talk too."" (feelings of failure, worthlessness, despair, isolation).
    - Specific plans: None mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: ""I tried to end it once before."" This is a direct statement of a past action taken to end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I tried to end it once before"" is a direct reference to a past attempt to end their life.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" expresses a clear desire to have died in the past, implying a current or lingering desire not to be alive.
    - Since there are explicit mentions and a clear desire, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method for suicide? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location being considered for suicide? No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There are no elements of a *current* plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? Yes, ""I tried to end it once before"" describes a specific past concrete action. It's not vague like ""I've been suicidal before"" but indicates an actual attempt was made.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, and strictly following the definitions below, which category fits best?
    - The post clearly describes a ""specific past concrete action"" the poster took to try to end their life (""I tried to end it once before"").
    - This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - Although there is current distress and a lingering wish to have succeeded (which could be seen as ideation), the defining element is the description of the past concrete action. The rule states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" While there are no *current* plans, the primary classifier for this post is the past attempt.

156,Can I please ! Talk to someone ? I'm having a bad panic attack. 18 and over please I just wanna kill myself out of fear,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I just wanna kill myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""bad panic attack"", ""out of fear"" indicate severe distress and emotional turmoil.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""I just wanna kill myself"".
    - This clearly indicates a desire to die. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I just wanna kill myself"").
    - However, it does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means being acquired, a specific location, a specific timeframe (beyond the immediate feeling), or any preparations.
    - Since no specific plan elements are present, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to end their life. It focuses on current feelings and desires. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states a desire to ""kill myself,"" which falls under the definition of 'Ideation' (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer).
    - It lacks any specific plan elements (method, means, location, timeframe, preparations), which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, differentiating it from 'Attempt'.
    - It clearly expresses a desire to die, differentiating it from 'Indicator'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrases ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" in the context of feeling ""defeated"" and being in a ""torture cycle"" strongly imply a desire to end one's life or suffering, which is a form of indirect suicidal ideation.
    - Emotional indicators: ""brain is screaming at me"", ""defeated"", ""torture cycle"". These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. The phrase ""give up and just get it over with"" in the context of severe distress and a ""torture cycle"" is an unambiguous expression of wanting to cease the current state of suffering, which implies a desire to not be alive. ""Why keep going?"" reinforces this. This clearly goes beyond general dissatisfaction and indicates a desire to end one's life/existence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): Does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No. There is no mention of how, where, or when this ""getting it over with"" would occur, nor any preparations.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to end suffering and existence (""give up and just get it over with"", ""why keep going?""), which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""a clear desire to not be alive any longer... 'I want it to be over'"").
    - It does not contain any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation), thus ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - It is more than 'Indicator' because it expresses a clear desire to cease existing/suffering, rather than just general distress or dissatisfaction.

158,"Please help. I'm really annoyed at people making fun at my spiritual beliefs like crystals, astrology, tarot, ect. And it happens A LOT. They just make me feel stupid for believing in something that not many people believe in. And it's not like any of them would stop and think about what they're doing, because they think we're just 'crazy' people that they can just make fun of for their entertainment. And I feel stupid for crying about it, because I feel like I'm a person who gets offended over everything. This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts. Thank you for listening.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""annoyed,"" ""feel stupid,"" ""crying about it,"" ""gets offended over everything."" These indicate distress, frustration, and low self-worth.
    - Specific plans: There are no mentions of specific methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: There are no descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts."" (Yes)
    - This clearly indicates a desire to die or suicidal intent. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" (suicidal intent is present).
    - However, it does NOT mention a specific method, specific means being acquired, a specific location, a specific timeframe, or clear signs of preparation.
    - Since there is no explicit plan, it does not fit the 'Behavior' definition.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post states ""I currently have suicidal thoughts."" It does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""I currently have suicidal thoughts,"" which directly aligns with the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's an explicit mention of suicidal thoughts.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there's no specific plan detailed.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action of an attempt is described.

159,Anyone here genuinely upset that they are planning to commit suicide?. My life won't ever be the same again and I can't change my circumstances that much so far. I'll never be happy if I continue to live but I'm angry also because if it weren't for my situation I would be happy to continue living. So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""planning to commit suicide"", ""end it"", ""have no choice but to end it"", ""the thought of going is also sad"", ""I have to go"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""genuinely upset"", ""can't change my circumstances"", ""never be happy"", ""miserable"", ""angry"", ""sad"", ""mad"", ""missing out"".
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"", ""at 21""), or preparations mentioned. The word ""planning"" refers to the intent/decision, not a concrete step-by-step plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""planning to commit suicide"", ""end it"", ""have no choice but to end it"".
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I'll never be happy if I continue to live"", ""I have to go"".
    - Since the answer is 'Yes' to both, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method for suicide? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location being considered for suicide? No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - The post states ""planning to commit suicide"" but does not provide any details about *how*, *when*, or *where* this plan would be executed, nor any preparations. It expresses the decision/intention to plan, but not the plan itself as defined by the criteria for 'Behavior'. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post is focused on current feelings and a future perceived necessity.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""planning to commit suicide"", ""end it"", ""have no choice but to end it"") and a clear desire to not be alive (""I have to go"", ""never be happy if I continue to live"").
    - It does NOT include any specific plan elements (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations) required for 'Behavior'.
    - It does NOT describe any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide, which would classify it as 'Attempt'.
    - It clearly goes beyond general distress, making it more than 'Indicator'.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but WITHOUT any specific plan.

I had to tell my parents almost everything about what I've been struggling with and it was mortifying and embarrassing and I want to rip my hair out. I do not like living with them but it was either that or going through with attempting suicide. I feel nauseous just knowing what they know now. I was so close to attempting suicide  but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am, dropping out of college and planning the move back home. I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""attempting suicide"" twice (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide"").
    - Emotional indicators: ""regretting it immensely,"" ""not mentally stable enough,"" ""mortifying and embarrassing,"" ""want to rip my hair out,"" ""do not like living with them,"" ""feel nauseous,"" ""dreading this,"" ""cannot stand living with my family."" These indicate significant distress, regret, and aversion to their current situation.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The phrase ""so close to attempting suicide"" indicates strong ideation and proximity to action, but not a described plan.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: The post states ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am"". This indicates that the attempt *did not occur*; rather, the alternative (confiding in mom and moving home) was chosen to prevent the attempt. Therefore, no concrete past action of an attempt is described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""attempting suicide"" and clearly indicates that suicide was a strong consideration or alternative to their current situation. This is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - While the post states ""I was so close to attempting suicide,"" it does not provide any specific details of a plan: no method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations are described. The post implies that the act was averted by confiding in family. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post describes being ""so close to attempting suicide"" and choosing an alternative action (telling mom, moving home) instead. It explicitly states it was ""either that or going through with attempting suicide,"" implying the attempt was *not* gone through with. Therefore, it does not describe a ""specific past concrete action"" that the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/consideration (""attempting suicide,"" ""so close to attempting suicide"") and a clear desire to avoid a situation that would lead to it, indicating a strong presence of suicidal ideation.
    - It does not describe a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation), which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a specific past concrete action of an attempt, which distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the explicit suicidal thoughts and desires without a described plan or a past concrete action.

161,I cant take it. I wont kill myself of course but the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity. Its excruciating,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
    - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm (direct and indirect language). The post explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course"". This is a direct negation of suicidal intent.
    - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, anhedonia, etc.). ""I cant take it,"" ""the pain makes me want to scream and break everything,"" ""Its excruciating"" indicate extreme distress, pain, and frustration.
    - Look for specific plans: No specific plans (methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations) are mentioned.
    - Check for clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself"" is mentioned, but immediately negated by ""I wont kill myself of course"".
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post expresses extreme pain and distress, but not a desire to die. It explicitly states the opposite.
    - If 'No' to both of the above (i.e., no explicit suicide terms AND no other clear desire to die expressed), then the post is likely 'Indicator'. Given the explicit negation of suicidal intent, this condition is met.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no suicidal intent or desire to die expressed.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No past concrete actions are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, and strictly following the definitions below, which category fits best?
    - The post expresses significant distress and pain (""I cant take it,"" ""excruciating"") but explicitly negates any suicidal intent (""I wont kill myself of course""). There is no clear desire to die or end one's life.
    - 'Attempt' is incorrect as no past concrete action is described.
    - 'Behavior' is incorrect as there is no suicidal intent and no plan.
    - 'Ideation' is incorrect because while ""kill myself"" is mentioned, it is immediately and clearly negated. There is no ""clear desire to not be alive any longer."" The distress is about the pain, not about wanting to end life.
    - 'Indicator' is the most appropriate. The definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive... it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'."" This post fits 'Indicator' because it expresses distress but explicitly denies suicidal intent and a desire to die.

162,I wish I could stop obsessing over appearance. All the females around me want to become prettier which has only intensified my gender dysphoria. I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing. I want to be a male now.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""obsessing over appearance,"" ""intensified my gender dysphoria,"" ""hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing."" These indicate distress, discomfort, and a strong desire for gender affirmation, but do not directly express hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, or anhedonia in a suicidal context.
    *   Specific plans: None. No mention of methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    *   Past concrete actions: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrase ""I want to be a male now"" expresses a desire for gender transition/affirmation, not a desire to die or cease existing. The other phrases express discomfort and dislike, not a wish to end life.
    *   Since the answer to both is 'No', the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Not applicable, as there is no suicidal intent or desire to die expressed.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses distress related to gender dysphoria and societal expectations regarding appearance. It uses strong emotional language like ""obsessing"" and ""hate."" However, it *does not* contain any explicit or implicit desire to die, end life, or commit suicide. There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, or any suicidal ideation or plans. The distress is focused on gender identity and presentation.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'Indicator' fits because it describes ""general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life"" and ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life.""
        *   'Ideation' is ruled out as there is no ""clear desire to not be alive any longer"" or ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts.""
        *   'Behavior' is ruled out as there is no suicidal intent or plan.
        *   'Attempt' is ruled out as there is no description of a past concrete action.
    *   Therefore, the post falls under 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" (indirect but clear reference to suicide).
    - Emotional indicators: ""absolutely hate myself,"" ""loathe my existence,"" ""Today was another day. A bad one.""
    - Specific plans: None mentioned. No method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned. The ""I did it"" refers to making the Reddit account, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The phrase ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to end one's life. ""I loathe my existence"" also indicates a strong desire not to be alive.
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die/end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., acquired rope, gun), location (e.g., specific bridge), timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my birthday""), or preparations (e.g., suicide note, giving away things) are mentioned. The post expresses a *wish* for courage to end it, but no concrete plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life. ""I did it"" refers to creating the Reddit account.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to end one's life (""wish I had the courage to end it all,"" ""loathe my existence""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There are no specific elements of a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action to end their life, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes a clear desire to not be alive any longer without any specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now,"" ""i almost committed suicide.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""my anxiety has gotten much more severe,"" ""interfering with almost everything i do,"" ""really sick of my family,"" ""no friends at school,"" ""shitty parents and siblings."" (hopelessness, isolation, distress).
    - Specific plans: The post states ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with, yet i still consider."" This indicates a lack of means for a past near-action and current consideration, but no specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for a *future* act.
    - Past concrete actions: ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"". This describes a strong intent or a near-event, but explicitly states that the action itself was *not* taken (""didn't have anything to do it with""). Therefore, it's not a description of a concrete action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" (""i almost committed suicide"") and clear expressions of wanting to die/not be alive (""i probably wouldn't be alive right now,"" ""yet i still consider"").
    - This means it is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post states ""didn't have anything to do it with"" in reference to the past near-event, and while it says ""yet i still consider,"" it does not provide any specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for a *current or future* suicide plan.
    - Therefore, there is no explicit plan identified for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post says ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"". This is crucial. The phrase ""didn't have anything to do it with"" means a concrete action was *not* taken. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a description of a ""specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life."" Since the action was not completed due to lack of means, it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan for a future act, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - The description of the past event (""almost committed suicide but I didn't have anything to do it with"") does not describe a concrete action taken, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings or a clear desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan and without describing a past concrete action.

165,suicide with me. can anyone suicide with me together. for those want to suicide too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used multiple times.
    - Emotional indicators: The repeated phrase ""suicide with me"" implies severe distress and a strong desire to die by suicide.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" and asks ""can anyone suicide with me together,"" which is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die by suicide.
    - Since there is an explicit mention of suicide and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post does not mention a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), specific means being acquired, a specific location, a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or any preparations (e.g., writing notes).
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. It is focused on a current desire/request, not a past event.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicide with me"") and a clear desire to die by suicide.
    - However, it lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparations) and does not describe a past concrete attempt.
    - This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan.

I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I want to kms"", ""killing myself"", ""hang myself"", ""kill myself"", ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"", ""trying again"", ""ending up in ICU"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared"", ""can't stop thinking"", ""can't focus on anything except trying again"", ""deserve"", ""burden"", ""liability"", ""grasping at straws"".
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   *Method:* ""hang myself"", ""put the rope around my neck"".
        *   *Means:* ""the rope"" (implied to be present and used).
        *   *Location:* ""my apartment"" (where the action took place).
        *   *Timeframe:* ""right now"", ""can't wait any longer"".
        *   *Preparations:* Mentions desired preparations (packing, resigning, money) that *haven't* been done, which is a reason for *stopping* the ""practice"" rather than a current preparation.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"". This is a description of a specific physical action taken by the poster, directly related to the suicidal method, even if labeled ""practice"" and aborted.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""I want to kms"", ""I really want to hang myself right now"", and ""I can't stop thinking about killing myself"". This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post mentions a specific method (""hang myself""), means (""the rope""), and current timeframe (""right now"", ""can't wait any longer""). This would qualify for 'Behavior' if there wasn't a past concrete action.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post states: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"". This describes a **specific past concrete action** the poster took that was a physical step towards ending their life, even if it was a ""practice"" and aborted due to fear of failure or lack of readiness. It's not just ideation or planning; it's an action taken. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life"". The phrase ""when I tried to cut my wrists"" is a good example from the definition; similarly, ""when I tried to hang myself"" (even if ""practice"") fits. The post also explicitly states ""I can't focus on anything except trying again,"" linking the past action to current intent. The rule explicitly states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It contains elements of a plan (method, means, timeframe), which would typically lead to 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the crucial element is the description of a **specific past concrete action**: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"". This is a physical act taken with suicidal intent, even if aborted. This moves the classification from 'Behavior' to 'Attempt' according to the definitions, especially given the note that if a post refers to past concrete attempts and current plans, it should be 'Attempt'.

        *   ""I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead.""
        *   ""I'll finally be at peace."" (implies peace in death)
        *   ""this job was making me suicidal""
        *   ""my suicidal ideation"" (past thoughts, not actions)
        *   ""I just want to fucking die.""
        *   ""I don't want to be here any more.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""sobbing,"" ""fucking overwhelmed,"" ""fucking failure,"" ""couldn't stop crying,"" ""couldn't breathe,"" feelings of being a burden, worthlessness, despair, abandonment.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" This explicitly mentions a specific **method** (""get a gun"") and **means** (a gun) that the person has considered and is still considering in the context of their current intent to ""do it."" While the exact execution is uncertain, the method/means itself is specific.
        *   No specific location, timeframe, or preparations (like writing notes, giving away things) are mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The post mentions ""my suicidal ideation"" (past thoughts) but does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut myself"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal ideation.""
    *   Yes, there are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more.""
    *   Since there are explicit mentions and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation?
        *   Yes, it mentions a specific **method** and **means**: ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" While the exact *how* is still being figured out, the *method* (gun) is specified as a long-held consideration for the act, and it's brought up in the context of current strong intent (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I know that I'm going to go through with it""). This fits the 'Behavior' definition requiring a specific method or specific tools/weapons with clear intent.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""My suicidal ideation"" refers to past thoughts, not a described past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a strong desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""violently suicidal""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a specific past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is suicidal thoughts/desire to die WITHOUT a specific plan. 'Behavior' includes suicidal thoughts/desire to die WITH a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations). The statement ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun"" provides a specific method and means being considered for the act, especially when coupled with the strong current intent (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I know that I'm going to go through with it""). This constitutes a specific element of a plan as defined under 'Behavior'.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""end things"" (used with ""full intentions to end things""), ""doesn't want me dead"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""apathetic about my existing"", ""want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb"" (anhedonia, desire for escape/numbness), ""pathetic?"".
    - Specific plans/preparations: ""just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This describes a past action (driving to a location) taken with a specific suicidal intent.
    - Past concrete actions: ""just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This is a description of a concrete action taken in furtherance of suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, ""full intentions to end things"" is a clear expression of suicidal intent/desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post describes a past action that was part of a plan: ""just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This involves a specific location and intent. However, the post then says ""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" indicating a current *reversal* of the immediate plan. The key here is that the *action* of driving there with intent *already happened*. This leans more towards a past action than a current, active plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The phrase ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" describes a **specific past concrete action** (driving to the mountains) that the poster took with the **intent to try to end their life**. Even though they state ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" immediately after, the action of driving there *with full intentions* to end their life constitutes an initiated attempt, or an action taken in furtherance of an attempt. This fits the definition of 'Attempt' which focuses on ""specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life."" It's an action that was started with suicidal intent, even if the final act was not completed or was reconsidered.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""full intentions to end things""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - The critical part is ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This is a description of a concrete action (driving to a location) taken with the clear intent to commit suicide. This is more than just ideation (thoughts/desire without a plan) and more than just stating a current plan (Behavior). It describes an action that was *taken* as part of an attempt, even if the attempt was interrupted or reconsidered. This falls under the 'Attempt' definition, which includes ""specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""I'm ready to die"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go.""
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness (""nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life"", ""Fuck this world"").
    - Specific plans:
        - ""The date was set a while ago. I even changed it."" - This indicates a specific timeframe has been considered and set, even if the exact date isn't revealed.
        - ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want."" - This is a direct mention of preparations.
        - ""I'm strapped in and ready to go."" - This indicates a high level of readiness and implies means are in place.
    - Past concrete actions: No descriptions of past concrete actions to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, ""I'm ready to die"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent is present.
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific timeframe: ""The date was set a while ago. I even changed it."" (This qualifies as a specific timeframe being set/considered).
        - Clear signs of preparation: ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want.""
        - Implied means/readiness: ""I'm strapped in and ready to go.""
    - Since there are elements of a specific timeframe and preparations, this strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm ready to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It explicitly mentions a timeframe (""The date was set a while ago"") and preparations (""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want""). These elements fall under the definition of a 'plan' for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""Im thinking of ending my life."" This is a direct expression of suicidal ideation.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post describes feelings of dissatisfaction (""I hate my course""), loneliness (""My 'friends' have all pretty much ditched me. Im left with only two good friends and five friends.""), past struggles with OCD and depression, and academic difficulties (""My grades dropped like shit,"" ""kicked out of sch""). These indicate significant distress.
    *   **Specific plans:** There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping""), means (e.g., ""I have the pills ready""), location (e.g., ""that bridge""), timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or preparations (e.g., ""writing notes"").
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There is no description of any specific past action taken to attempt suicide (e.g., ""I overdosed last year"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""Im thinking of ending my life,"" which clearly indicates a desire to die or suicidal thoughts. This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   No, the post does not mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide. It's a thought, not a plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. It details past struggles and academic issues, but not a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.

171,its working!. hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""hopefully this is my last post on here"", ""pls let me never wake up"". These strongly imply a desire to cease existing.
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, desire for an end to life.
    - Specific plans: The phrase ""its working!"" suggests an action is in progress, but it does not specify a *method*, *means*, *location*, or *specific timeframe* for suicide. It lacks the concrete detail required for a ""plan"" as defined for 'Behavior'.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life"": No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: Yes. ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up"" are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/not be alive.
    - Conclusion: Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No. ""its working!"" is vague and does not specify *what* method.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide: No. ""last post"" implies soon, but not a *specific* timeframe for the act itself (e.g., ""tonight"", ""on my birthday"").
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - Conclusion: While ""its working!"" implies something is happening, it does not provide the necessary specificity (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation) to classify it as a 'Behavior' according to the strict definition. The guideline states: ""If suicidal intent/desire to die is present, but you are genuinely uncertain about the presence of an explicit plan (as defined by method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation), choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.""

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post refers to a current or imminent state, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""hopefully this is my last post on here"", ""pls let me never wake up""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - While ""its working!"" suggests an ongoing action, it does not specify a method, means, location, or specific timeframe for suicide. Without these specific elements of a plan as defined, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation', which includes a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""saying im gonna do it"", ""this time i actually have the means to"", ""tonight im gonna do it"", ""im so ready to die"".
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling ""out of it"", clear desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains unambiguous expressions of wanting to die (""im so ready to die"") and intent to end life (""tonight im gonna do it"", ""saying im gonna do it"", ""this time i actually have the means to""). (Yes)
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - The post mentions a specific **method** (taking pills).
    - It mentions specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent (""i have 42 unnamed pills"", ""i also have some allergy medicine"", ""i actually have the means to"").
    - It mentions a specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide (""tonight im gonna do it"").
    - These elements clearly indicate a plan. (Yes)

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life. ""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"" refers to past ideation/statements, not a described physical action of an attempt. (No)

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, there is clear suicidal intent/desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 3, there are explicit mentions of a specific method (pills), means (having the pills), and a specific timeframe (""tonight""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

    - Emotional indicators: ""tired,"" ""alone,"" ""struggled with mental illness,"" ""unwanted nuisance,"" ""lonely,"" ""anxious,"" ""no one loves me or even likes me."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness.
    - Specific plans: There are no mentions of specific methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:

    - Since there are explicit mentions of suicide and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):

        - Specific method: No.
        - Specific means: No.
        - Specific location: No.
        - Specific timeframe: No.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - Since no elements of a plan are present, it does not fit the 'Behavior' category.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post mentions struggling with mental illness since childhood but does not describe any past suicide attempts.
    - Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life (""kill myself"", ""I want to be done"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I really want to check out"" is a clear euphemism for wanting to die. The word ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""running on nothing but shear spite,"" ""can not really express how much I want to check out,"" ""spite has its limits."" These indicate extreme distress, exhaustion, and a weakening will to live.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and contains unambiguous expressions of wanting to die (""I really want to check out,"" ""how much I want to check out"").
    - Yes, there is clear desire to die and explicit suicide mention. This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrases ""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im going to do it,"" and ""im done"" strongly imply an intent to end life. While ""suicide"" is not explicitly used, ""im going to do it"" in this context is a direct declaration of suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""im in so much pain,"" ""i cant handle it anymore,"" ""i cant. i cant."" indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and an inability to cope.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., gun, rope), location (e.g., bridge, building), or specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week,"" a specific date/age) is mentioned. The farewells (""thank you to the people i met thru this sub. and i hope everyone finds something to live for."") could be interpreted as signs of preparation (saying goodbyes).
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""im going to do it"" combined with ""i cant do this anymore"" and ""im done"" is a very strong and unambiguous expression of intent to end life. This is beyond just a desire to die; it implies an intent to act.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die/intent to act, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**: No.
        *   Specific **means**: No.
        *   A specific **location**: No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**: No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: The phrases ""thank you to the people i met thru this sub. and i hope everyone finds something to live for."" are strong indicators of saying final goodbyes, which is a form of preparation.
    *   However, the 'Behavior' definition states: ""A plan MUST include one or more of the following: a specific method, specific means, a specific timeframe, mention of specific tools/weapons/substances, or specific locations."" The bulleted list does *not* explicitly include ""preparations"" or ""saying final goodbyes.""
    *   The guideline states: ""If suicidal intent/desire to die is present, but you are genuinely uncertain about the presence of an explicit plan (as defined by method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation), choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" More importantly, ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan (containing at least one of the elements above [referring to the bulleted list]), choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.""
    *   Despite the strong declaration of intent (""im going to do it"") and the farewells, the post does not contain any of the specific elements listed in the *bulleted definition* of a ""plan"" for 'Behavior' (method, means, location, specific timeframe). The farewells, while preparations, are not explicitly listed in the *definitive bullet points* for 'Behavior'. Therefore, based on the strict interpretation of the 'Behavior' definition's bullet points, and the tie-breaker rule, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a strong desire to end life and an intent to act (""im going to do it,"" ""im done,"" ""i cant do this anymore""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. While the post conveys a very high level of distress and intent to act, and includes farewells (which are a type of preparation), it lacks the specific elements of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe) as strictly defined by the bullet points under the 'Behavior' category. The guideline explicitly states to choose 'Ideation' if unsure about the presence of an explicit plan as defined by those elements. Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation'.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""stupid,"" ""lot of stress,"" ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""never really seen myself going anywhere in life,"" ""why not."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and a feeling of being overwhelmed, leading to a desire to end life.
    *   Specific plans: The post asks ""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"". This is a direct inquiry about a *method* for suicide. While not stating they *have* a method, the act of seeking information about a specific method is a clear step towards planning.
    *   Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die (""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""why not"" in this context).
    *   This confirms it's more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**: The post asks for a ""way to kill myself,"" which is a direct request for a method. This active seeking of a method, even if it's a question, indicates the presence of planning elements as defined for 'Behavior' (seeking a specific method).
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed: Not explicitly stated, but the question is about identifying means.
        *   A specific **location**: No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**: No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: No.
    *   The inquiry about a ""way"" (method) to kill oneself is a strong indicator of planning, moving beyond just ideation. It's not just thinking about dying; it's actively seeking *how* to do it. This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition's inclusion of ""a specific method.""

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there's explicit suicide language and a clear desire to die.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.
    *   Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': 'Ideation' is thoughts/desire without a specific plan. 'Behavior' includes suicidal thoughts/desire *with* a plan, which includes mentioning a specific method. The user is actively seeking a ""way"" (method) to kill themselves, which is a clear step in planning. This active inquiry about *how* to commit suicide, specifically asking for a method, moves it from mere ideation to behavior.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly uses terms like ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""peaceful way to die,"" ""end it with pills,"" ""liver failure,"" ""liver will slowly die."" It describes the physical process and negative consequences of an overdose.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** There are no emotional indicators from the *poster* themselves. The tone is informative and cautionary.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific plans are mentioned by the *poster*. The post discusses overdosing in general terms as a warning.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past concrete actions taken by the *poster* are described. The descriptions of symptoms are general information about overdoses, not a personal account.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, it uses ""commit suicide"" and ""end it with pills.""
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. Crucially, the *poster* does *not* express a desire to die or end their life. The post is a warning *against* taking pills to commit suicide, describing the unpleasant and often non-fatal outcomes. The phrase ""Don't take the pills"" is a direct deterrent.

    *Self-correction based on the rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"":* Although the post *mentions* suicide, it does not express the *poster's own* suicidal thoughts, feelings, or desire to die. The intent of the post is to discourage suicide by overdose, not to express personal suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Not applicable, as the poster does not express suicidal intent or a desire to die.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Not applicable, as the poster does not describe a specific past concrete action they took to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post uses explicit terms related to suicide (""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing"").
    *   However, the critical distinction for 'Ideation' is ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer."" The *poster* is not expressing *their own* suicidal thoughts or feelings, nor a desire to die. Instead, they are providing information to deter others from suicide by overdose.
    *   The 'Indicator' definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life."" While this post *does* have explicit expressions concerning suicide, it *lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life* *from the person writing the post*. The primary purpose and tone of the post are cautionary and informative, aiming to prevent suicide rather than express it. Given the strict rule that ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post,"" and the poster is clearly *against* the act they are describing, it cannot be Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt. It falls into Indicator because it doesn't convey the *poster's own* suicidal risk.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""im positive im gonna do it"", ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this"". These clearly indicate suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""mental health issues"", ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""fed up of this"". These show distress and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans:
        - Methods: None.
        - Means: None.
        - Locations: None.
        - Specific timeframes: ""in the future"", ""when im fed up of this"". These are vague and conditional, not specific timeframes like ""tonight"" or ""on my 21st birthday"" (where 21 is the planned age for the act, not just current age). The mention of ""im 20"" is current age, not a specific planned age for suicide.
        - Preparations: None.
    - Past concrete actions: None. ""ive been having mental health issues"" refers to general history, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? While not using those exact phrases, ""im positive im gonna do it"" and ""no motivation to keep on living"" and ""ill do it when im fed up of this"" are unambiguous expressions of suicidal intent.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""no motivation to keep on living"" and ""ill do it when im fed up of this"" clearly express a desire to cease existing.
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is clear suicidal intent/desire to die. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No.
        - Specific means: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: ""in the future"" and ""when im fed up of this"" are too vague and conditional to be considered a specific timeframe for carrying out suicide as defined for 'Behavior'. The age ""im 20"" is current age, not a planned age for the act.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - Conclusion: No elements of a specific plan are present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post mentions ""mental health issues"" but no actual attempt.
    - Conclusion: No, this is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life (""im positive im gonna do it"", ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - However, the post does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations) for carrying out suicide. The timeframes mentioned are vague and conditional (""in the future"", ""when im fed up of this""). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die, but without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
    - Emotional indicators: Strong negative emotions (""I fucking hate my parents,"" ""psychologically tortured""), feelings of neglect and suffering.
    - Specific plans: No mention of methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: No.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post describes a life of suffering (""living a life psychologically tortured"") but does not express a desire to *end* that life or die. It focuses on the negative experience of being alive due to parental actions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no explicit suicidal intent or desire to die expressed in the post.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Not applicable, as there is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses intense distress, anger, and a feeling of being ""psychologically tortured."" However, it does not contain any explicit suicidal language or a clear, unambiguous desire to die or not be alive. It describes the *experience* of living as negative, but not a wish to *cease* living.
    - According to the definitions:
        - 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., 'I want to die,' 'I hate living,' 'I wish I could disappear,' 'I want it to be over')"". This post does not meet this criterion.
        - 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., 'life sucks,' 'I'm so unhappy,' 'I feel worthless,' 'I'm struggling').""

There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it.

Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post describes a dream involving ""mass murdering people"" by ""foreign men,"" but this is an external threat within a dream, not related to the poster's own self-harm or suicidal intent. There are no mentions of the poster wanting to die or harm themselves.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""severe panic attack,"" ""terrified,"" ""sheer panic,"" ""absolutely terrifying,"" ""anxious to sleep."" These indicate significant distress, anxiety, and fear, but not specifically hopelessness, despair, or worthlessness related to the poster's own life or suicidal thoughts. The anxiety is about the dream's vividness and avoiding similar experiences.
    *   **Specific plans:** None. The post is about a dream and its emotional aftermath.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The poster expresses fear and anxiety *due to* a dream about violence, not a desire to end their own life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or desire to die, this step is not applicable.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes a vivid, terrifying dream and the subsequent severe panic attack and anxiety.
    *   It clearly indicates distress (""severe panic attack,"" ""terrified,"" ""anxious to sleep"").
    *   However, there is absolutely no mention of suicide, self-harm, or a desire to die or end one's life. The fear is external (from the dream), not internal suicidal ideation.
    *   Based on the definitions:
        *   It does not meet 'Attempt' because no past concrete action of suicide is described.
        *   It does not meet 'Behavior' because there is no suicidal intent and no plan.
        *   It does not meet 'Ideation' because there are no explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a clear desire to not be alive.
        *   It fits 'Indicator' as it contains ""general expressions of distress"" (panic, terror, anxiety) but ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""end this suffering"" (clear desire to die/end life), ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"" (direct description of past self-harm/suicide attempt).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fear and despair,"" ""suffering.""
    *   **Specific plans:** The phrase ""so i can do it"" implies a desire to act, but it's conditional (""if I can believe in something"") and lacks any specific method, means, location, or timeframe for a *current* plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" This is a clear, concrete description of a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, ""end this suffering"" is a clear desire to cease existing.
    *   The statement ""ive overdosed twice... once on purpose"" explicitly refers to a past suicide attempt.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   While there's a desire to ""do it,"" there is no specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation mentioned for a *current* plan. It's contingent on finding ""something to believe in."" Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' based on a *current* plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post clearly states: ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" The ""once on purpose"" part describes a ""specific past concrete action"" the poster took to try to end their life. This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'. The rule states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" Here, it describes a past attempt and also expresses current ideation (""so i can do it,"" ""end this suffering"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The most prominent and definitive element in the post is the description of a past concrete suicide attempt (""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"").
    *   This perfectly aligns with the 'Attempt' definition: ""The content describes one or more specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life.""
    *   Even though there is current ideation, the presence of a described past concrete attempt takes precedence according to the guidelines.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""all of a sudden I'm suicidal again.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I thought I was getting better,"" ""bad days,"" ""I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood,"" ""scared to stress him even more."" These indicate distress, a relapse into a negative mental state, and concern for others.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The mention of running out of meds is a source of distress, not a means being acquired for suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. ""I'm suicidal again"" refers to the return of suicidal thoughts/feelings, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""I'm suicidal again.""
    - This means it is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""I'm suicidal again"" refers to the current state of ideation, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal again""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.

    - Emotional indicators: ""anxious,"" ""doubt everything,"" ""worthless,"" ""painful,"" ""too hard.""
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""Everytime I try I fail."" This is vague and does not describe a concrete action taken to attempt suicide (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists""). It could refer to trying to cope or trying to improve.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains the direct phrase ""I want to die more than ever.""
    - It also expresses a clear desire to not be alive: ""I can't have this life it's too painful.""
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2, suicidal intent is present.
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations? No. There is no indication of *how* or *when* they might act on their desire to die.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The phrase ""Everytime I try I fail"" is too general and does not describe a concrete action of a suicide attempt. It does not meet the definition of 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I want to die more than ever,"" ""I can't have this life it's too painful""), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide by hanging.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""still not sure,"" ""don't want lied to,"" ""please be honest"" indicate distress, contemplation, and a search for specific information related to the act.
    *   **Specific plans:** ""ive alr tied the noose"" is a clear description of a preparation, a specific means, and a method being considered.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** There are no descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" and discusses ""suicide by hanging."" This clearly indicates a desire to die or end one's life. (Yes)
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post mentions a specific **method** for suicide: ""suicide by hanging.""
    *   It mentions specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent and clear **preparation**: ""ive alr tied the noose.""
    *   It does not mention a specific location or timeframe, but the presence of a method and preparation is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and shows a clear desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by describing a specific method (""hanging"") and a concrete preparation/means (""tied the noose""). This fulfills the criteria for 'Behavior' (explicit suicidal thoughts/desire + a plan including method and means/preparation).

    - Emotional indicators: Self-loathing (""I'm a pervert""), distress, hopelessness (""I can't help my sexual feelings"").
    - Specific plans: None mentioned. There is no method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""I want to die,"" which are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die.
    - This means the post is beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal intent (""Should I kill myself?"", ""I want to die"") but does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills""), specific means being acquired, a specific location, a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), or any clear signs of preparation.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It asks a question about killing themselves and expresses a current desire to die, but no past action.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""Should I kill myself?"") and a clear desire to die (""I want to die""). This fits the first part of the 'Ideation' definition.
    - Crucially, it is ""WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide,"" which aligns perfectly with 'Ideation' and differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear desire to die/explicit suicide mention.

    - Past concrete actions: No description of a past suicide attempt. The mention of past sexual assault is a traumatic event, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life"": No direct use of these terms.
    - Other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: Yes, ""i just wanna end it"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to cease existing, fitting the 'Ideation' definition of ""I want it to be over.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post does not mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to ""end it,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to cease existing or not be alive. This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition (""clear desire to not be alive any longer,"" ""I want it to be over"").
    - There are no elements of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action of attempting suicide, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Because there is a clear desire to ""end it,"" it goes beyond general distress and thus is not 'Indicator'. The 'Indicator' definition explicitly states: ""If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive... it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'.""
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

187,"Consider going hobo. Hi people. I just want to point out the alternative for anyone on the brink of suicide. There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant. Living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes, begging or stealing to keep fed. Its not a great situation, but on both occasions it was better than the predicaments that preceded it. And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""on the brink of suicide""). However, this is framed as a past feeling for the author and a current state for ""anyone"" else, not a current personal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""felt like I couldn't cope,"" ""predicaments that preceded it."" These are past feelings.
    - Specific plans: No specific plans for suicide are mentioned. The post describes an *alternative* (going hobo) to suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: The author describes past actions of ""hit the road and went vagrant."" This is presented as an action that *saved* them from suicide, not an action taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""on the brink of suicide.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The author states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment,"" and that the ""road has saved me in the past."" This indicates a lack of current desire to die. The mention of ""suicide"" is in the context of discussing a coping mechanism for past feelings or for others, not a current personal intent.
    - Since there is no clear desire to die expressed *by the author for themselves at the time of writing*, despite the word ""suicide"" being present as a topic, this suggests 'Indicator'. The definition for 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer."" This post does not contain such a *current personal expression* from the author.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no current suicidal intent or desire to die expressed by the author.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The action described (""hit the road and went vagrant"") was an *alternative* to suicide, explicitly stated as having ""saved me.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post mentions ""suicide"" as a concept and refers to past times when the author felt ""on the brink of suicide."" However, the primary message is about a coping mechanism that *prevented* suicide for the author and is offered as an alternative to others.
    - Crucially, the author explicitly states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment,"" and that the alternative ""saved me in the past."" There is no current expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, or a plan/attempt by the author.
    - The presence of the word ""suicide"" as a topic, without a current personal expression of suicidal intent or desire to die from the author, aligns with the 'Indicator' definition, which states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life"" *from the individual posting*. While the word ""suicide"" is present, it's not *their* current explicit expression of intent. It's a discussion of a past state and a general topic. The post is about coping and survival, not current risk.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I can't go on anymore"", ""end it"". ""End it"" in this context, especially with the farewell ""I love you all so much"", clearly implies ending one's life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""life has been getting worse"", ""addiction for years"", ""drunk"", ""so lonely"", ""fucked up my life"", ""miss outside"", ""miss being happy"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans: ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"". This includes a specific timeframe (""tonight""). The phrase ""end it"" is the intended action. The ""I love you all so much 💛"" can be interpreted as a farewell/preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: No descriptions of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No explicit ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"".
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" combined with ""I love you all so much 💛"" are unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/end life.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die expressed, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present):
        - A specific **method**: ""end it"" is not a specific method (e.g., ""pills"", ""jumping"").
        - Specific **means**: No.
        - A specific **location**: No.
        - A specific **timeframe**: YES, ""tonight"". This explicitly matches the definition for 'Behavior' (""e.g., 'I'm ending it tonight'"").
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: ""I love you all so much 💛"" strongly suggests a farewell, which is a sign of preparation.
    - Given the specific timeframe (""tonight"") and the farewell, this strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post describes current intent and a plan for ""tonight"".

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die (""I can't go on anymore,"" ""end it""). Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly mentions a specific timeframe for the act (""tonight"") and includes what appears to be a farewell (""I love you all so much 💛""), which are elements of a plan as defined under 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Because it includes a specific timeframe and implied preparation, it goes beyond 'Ideation' and fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""successfully end my life"" - explicit mention of ending life.
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied high distress and intent to end life.
    *   Specific plans: ""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen."" This indicates specific *means* (substances) are possessed or readily available, and the question is about their efficacy for suicide. The user is asking about a *method* (overdose) using these *means*.
    *   Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the direct phrase ""successfully end my life,"" which is an explicit expression of wanting to die by suicide.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post mentions:
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: ""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen."" This clearly states possession/access to specific substances with suicidal intent.
        *   A specific **method** is implied: using these substances to ""successfully end my life"" (i.e., overdose).
    *   This clearly indicates elements of a plan (specific means and implied method).

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It is asking about a future action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear desire to die/end life (Step 2). Therefore, it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly mentions possessing specific substances (""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"") and asks about using them to ""successfully end my life."" This constitutes mentioning specific *means* with clear suicidal intent, which falls under the definition of a 'plan' for 'Behavior'.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because a specific plan (possessing means) is present.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""why shouldi live"", ""desire to end"" (implies ending life), ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"", ""cant live like this for the rest ofmy life"", ""cant stand being here any other moment"", ""cant imagine myslef living another year thisway"". These are strong expressions of not wanting to live or wanting to cease existing.
    - Emotional indicators: ""failed everything"", ""wasted it"", ""resisting the desire"", ""fuckingcant do this anymore"", ""im not happy or enjoying anythnig"", ""nobody fucking understands me and tries to help nobody knows how i suffer everyday"", ""why me is living like this what did ii do to suffer i never been happy since birth"". (Hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, worthlessness, extreme distress).
    - Specific plans: No mention of a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe for an act (e.g., ""tonight"", ""at 21""), or preparations. The phrase ""cant imagine myslef living another year thisway"" expresses endurance limit, not a plan. ""cant stand being here any other moment"" expresses immediate distress, not a plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? While ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used, ""desire to end"" and ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"" strongly imply suicidal thoughts/feelings.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""why shouldi live"", ""i fuckingcant do this anymore"", ""cant live like this for the rest ofmy life"", ""i cant stand being here any other moment"", ""i cant imagine myslef living another year thisway"". These are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or not wanting to continue living.
    - Conclusion for Step 2: Yes, there is a clear desire to die/not be alive. This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No. ""cant imagine myslef living another year thisway"" is a statement about endurance, not a plan for an act within a specific timeframe. ""cant stand being here any other moment"" is an expression of immediate distress, not a plan.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Conclusion for Step 3: No elements of a specific plan are present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post mentions ""resisting the desire to end"" which refers to past ideation/struggle, not a past concrete action.
    - Conclusion for Step 4: No past attempt described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, the post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive and strong suicidal thoughts (""desire to end"", ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 3, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe for an act, preparations) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits the definition of 'Ideation', as it contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a clear desire to not be alive, but without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""commit suicide"" is explicitly mentioned. The word ""eventually"" indicates a future, but not a specific, defined timeframe.
    *   Emotional indicators: The phrasing ""How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?"" implies significant distress, a sense of inevitability, and a struggle with the implications of this thought.
    *   Specific plans: There is no mention of a specific method, means, location, or a *specific* timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week,"" ""on my birthday""). ""Eventually"" is too vague to be considered a specific timeframe for a plan. There are no preparations mentioned.
    *   Past concrete actions: There is no description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""commit suicide.""
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, the statement ""you will probably commit suicide eventually"" is a clear expression of a belief or intention regarding ending one's life.
    *   Since there is an explicit mention of suicide and a clear desire/expectation to die by suicide, this is not 'Indicator'. Proceed to analyze for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**? No.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        *   A specific **location** being considered for suicide? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide? No. ""Eventually"" is not specific enough (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week,"" ""at 21"").
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? No.
    *   Since none of the elements of a specific plan are present, it does not fit the definition of 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post refers to a future likelihood, not a past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains an explicit mention of ""commit suicide"" and a clear expression of suicidal thoughts/intent (""you will probably commit suicide eventually""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, *specific* timeframe, or preparations). The word ""eventually"" does not qualify as a specific timeframe for 'Behavior'. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"" is a direct mention of suicide/self-harm.

    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: No description of a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""end myself"" is a direct phrase indicating a desire to end one's life.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""end myself"" falls under this.
    - Since 'Yes' to the first part, the post is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since none of these elements of a plan are present, it does not fit the 'Behavior' definition.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post describes past financial mistakes and current emotional distress, but no past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear expression of suicidal thoughts (""end myself"") which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It explicitly lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a specific past concrete action of attempting suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" directly references the concept of the poster dying. This implies that the idea of dying was previously present or considered as an option.
    - Emotional indicators: ""abusive ex,"" ""mental health stuff,"" ""not okay right now."" There's also a hopeful tone (""hopeful thought,"" ""hope i can have that one day,"" ""can be okay"").
    - Specific plans: None.
    - Past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life"": No.
    - OR, other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" directly acknowledges that the idea of dying was a consideration for the poster. While the current sentiment is a hopeful shift *away* from it, the very mention of ""need to die"" in the context of personal distress indicates that suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive were present. This moves it beyond general distress. It implies a previous or lingering ideation that the poster is now challenging. Therefore, Yes, it implies a clear desire to die was present, even if it's now being reconsidered.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is implied as having been present), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No. There are absolutely no elements of a plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. It talks about the *thought* of dying (""need to die""), not a past action taken.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly references the concept of the poster dying (""maybe i don't need to die""). This indicates that thoughts of ending their life were present, even if the current sentiment is a hopeful step away from it. This explicit acknowledgment of ""dying"" as a personal consideration means it's more than just 'Indicator' (which lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die).
    - Since there is no specific plan mentioned (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation), it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - Since there is no description of a concrete past action to end life, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation', as it includes an implicit expression of suicidal thoughts (by negating the ""need to die"") without a specific plan. The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" directly points to the presence of the thought of dying as a personal option.

        *   Preparations: ""dont tell me not to do this bc i will do it anyway"" (implies intent to take the pills regardless of advice).
    *   Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" is an explicit mention of suicidal ideation.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? The user states ""i don't wanna die rn"", but the presence of ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" indicates an underlying or persistent desire/tendency. The question ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" and ""what is the worst thing that can happen to me"" in the context of ""suicidal thoughts"" suggests an awareness of the lethal potential, even if the immediate intent is calm.
    *   *Conclusion for Step 2:* Yes, the explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" indicates ideation is present. It's more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present via ""suicidal thoughts"").
    *   Does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method** for suicide: ""taking 3 xanax pills"".
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: ""3 xanax pills"".
        *   A specific **timeframe**: ""rn"" (right now).
    *   However, the crucial part for 'Behavior' is whether this plan/action is *intended to commit suicide*. The post explicitly states: ""i don't wanna die rn i just came here bc i thought some of u would know something about this so. can you die from taking 3 xanax pills? ... i just wanna be calm rn"". The user states their immediate intent for taking the pills is to be calm, not to die. While they ask about the lethal potential, they also state ""i don't think thats possible"" and explicitly deny wanting to die *right now*. The suicidal thoughts are present, but the described action (taking pills) is not presented as a step in a suicide plan or as an act intended to lead to suicide. The user is asking about potential consequences, not stating an intent to achieve death.
    *   *Guideline check:* ""If suicidal intent/desire to die is present, but you are genuinely uncertain about the presence of an explicit plan (as defined by method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation), choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Here, the *intent* of the action (taking pills) is explicitly stated as calmness, not suicide, despite the presence of general suicidal thoughts. This makes it uncertain if the plan is *for suicide*.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Based on Step 2, the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" means it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   Based on Step 4, it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' involves suicidal thoughts/desire to die *without a specific plan to commit suicide*. 'Behavior' involves suicidal thoughts/desire to die *AND a plan to commit suicide or self-harm intended to lead to suicide*.
    *   While the user is taking pills (a method/means), they explicitly state their intent is ""to be calm rn"" and ""i don't wanna die rn"". The questions about dying are inquiries about potential outcomes, not declarations of intent. The ""suicidal thoughts"" are present generally (""always there when i'm bored""), but the *current action* of taking the pills is not presented as being *for* suicide. Therefore, there is no *plan to commit suicide* explicitly stated or implied by the action itself. The action is for calming, even if suicidal thoughts are in the background. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' more precisely.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"", ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""shitface"", ""fucking monster"", ""I don't know what to do at this point"", ""just a piece of human garbage"", ""i hurt my friend just because of some stupid feelings i have"". These indicate severe self-loathing, guilt, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans:
        - ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"": This is a conditional timeframe for suicide. It specifies *when* the act is intended to occur (upon a specific condition being met).
        - ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"": This is an inquiry about a specific method and location for self-harm, which, in the context of the explicit suicide statement, can be considered part of seeking a plan or a form of self-harming behavior.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""kill myself"" and a clear desire to die (""I will wait until I can kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on the presence of suicidal intent (from step 2), does the post mention elements of a plan?
        - Specific timeframe: Yes, ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"" provides a conditional timeframe for the act.
        - Specific method/location: The question ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" is an inquiry about a method and location for self-harm. While self-harm is distinct from suicide, in this context, it's combined with a clear statement of suicidal intent, suggesting a search for means or methods related to ending one's life or severe self-harm. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""self-harming behavior intended to lead to suicide"" and mention of a ""specific method"". Seeking information on a method/location for self-harm, especially when coupled with a direct suicide threat, aligns with this.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""kill myself"") and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - It contains clear suicidal intent AND elements of a plan: a conditional timeframe (""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"") and an inquiry about methods/locations for self-harm (""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing""). These elements fulfill the criteria for 'Behavior' as they indicate a plan or specific intent related to the act.

196,Im probably going to kill myself soon. I've been feeling a really strong urge to lately and the only people i have in my life dont care. They dont make any effort to keep me around. i just wish i wasn't even born to begin with. life is fucking stupid,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""going to kill myself soon"" (direct), ""wish I wasn't even born"" (indirect, desire not to exist).
    - Emotional indicators: ""strong urge,"" ""dont care,"" ""dont make any effort to keep me around,"" ""life is fucking stupid"" (hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, anhedonia).
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or preparations are mentioned. The timeframe ""soon"" is vague and not specific enough to meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires examples like ""tonight,"" ""on my 21st birthday"").
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""going to kill myself soon.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I wish I wasn't even born to begin with.""
    - Since yes to both, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): Yes, intent is present.
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? ""soon"" is mentioned. However, the definition for 'Behavior' specifies ""a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., 'I'm ending it tonight,' 'I plan to do it on my birthday,' 'I'll kill myself at 21')"". ""Soon"" is too general and lacks the specificity required for a 'Behavior' classification. It indicates urgency but not a concrete plan detail.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since no specific plan elements (method, means, specific location, *specific* timeframe, preparation) are present, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""going to kill myself soon"") and a clear desire to not be alive (""wish I wasn't even born""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There are no specific plan elements (method, means, specific location, specific timeframe, or preparation) as defined for 'Behavior'. The word ""soon"" is not specific enough to qualify as a plan element for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action to attempt suicide, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post expresses suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die without a specific plan, which perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""plummet to the ground"" and ""corpse"" directly relate to death by self-inflicted means.
    - Emotional indicators: ""so tempted,"" ""guilt,"" ""fear"" indicate distress and internal conflict regarding the suicidal thought.
    - Specific plans: ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" explicitly mentions a specific method (jumping/plummeting) and a specific location (""highest floor"").
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of a desire to die by suicide, even if framed as a temptation. The mention of becoming a ""corpse"" reinforces this.
    - Conclusion for Step 2: Yes, there is a clear desire to die/end existence. This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): Yes.
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific **method**: ""plummet to the ground"" (jumping). Yes.
        - Specific **means**: Not explicitly stated, but implied by the method.
        - A specific **location**: ""the highest floor"". Yes.
        - A specific **timeframe**: No.
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: No.
    - Since a specific method and a specific location are mentioned, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post describes a current temptation/thought process, not a past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, the post expresses a clear desire to die, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 3, the post includes specific elements of a plan: a specific method (""plummet to the ground"") and a specific location (""the highest floor""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - It is not 'Ideation' because a specific plan (method and location) is present.
    - It is not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.

198,"If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he wont feel that bad if I kill myself. Any thoughts?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct mention of suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: Implied distress, guilt, and a distorted perception of how their death would affect others.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""If I... he won't feel that bad if I kill myself"" is a hypothetical statement, not a plan.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: No past actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
    - This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal intent (""kill myself"").
    - Does it mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation? No. The statement is conditional (""If I deeply hurt my boyfriend... he won't feel that bad if I kill myself"") and does not outline *how* or *when* or *where* this would occur, nor does it indicate any preparation.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. It refers to a hypothetical future action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit mention of ""kill myself,"" which signifies suicidal thoughts/feelings or a clear desire to not be alive. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) mentioned. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.

This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""jump"", ""suicide"", ""took their life"" (referring to someone else but in context of own thoughts), ""wanted to die"", ""gain the courage"" (to jump).
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""How does no one notice""), despair, seeking help/intervention (""maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care"").
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""jump""
        - Location: ""ledge of a hospital parking garage""
        - Timeframes: Describes past instances of being there (""Sometimes for an hour"", ""The last time""). No specific future timeframe for the act itself.
        - Preparations: Not explicitly mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: The post explicitly states, ""I can never get the nerve to jump."" This indicates no past concrete action of an attempt by the poster. The mention of someone else taking their life ""6 years ago"" is not about the poster.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" and clear expressions of wanting to die or end life (e.g., ""wanted to die"", ""gain the courage to jump"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific **method**: Yes, ""jump"".
        - Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: The location provides the means (height for jumping).
        - A specific **location**: Yes, ""ledge of a hospital parking garage"".
        - A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide: No specific *future* timeframe for the act itself, but describes repeated instances of being at the location with intent.
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: No explicit preparation mentioned, but the act of physically going to the location and attempting to ""work up the nerve"" is a concrete step towards execution of a plan.
    - The presence of a specific method (""jump"") and a specific location (""ledge of a hospital parking garage"") combined with the active engagement of being there ""Trying to work up the nerve to jump"" strongly indicates a plan. This goes beyond mere ideation.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post states, ""I can never get the nerve to jump,"" explicitly indicating no past attempt by the poster. The reference to someone else's suicide is not relevant for the poster's classification.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's clear suicidal intent and explicit mentions of suicide/desire to die.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no specific past concrete action of an attempt by the poster is described.
    - It falls under 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation' because it includes not just suicidal thoughts/desire to die, but also specific elements of a plan (method: ""jump"", location: ""ledge of a hospital parking garage"") and active steps towards executing that plan (physically being at the location, ""Trying to work up the nerve""). This active engagement with the plan, even if the final act hasn't occurred, classifies it as 'Behavior'.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""The first time I tried committing suicide"", ""die in combat"", ""multiple attempts on my life"", ""my death seems to ultimate answer"", ""searching about ways to kill myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""struggling with depression"", ""life is going absolutely shitty"", ""felt hopeless"", ""hated myself"", ""mentally exhausting"", ""all I caused was problems and drove everyone away"".
    - Specific plans: ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"". This indicates active preparation/seeking a method.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope"". This is a specific description of a past action. ""I have multiple attempts on my life"" further supports this, with the first one being detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""tried committing suicide"", ""multiple attempts on my life"", and ""searching about ways to kill myself"". It also expresses a clear desire for death: ""my death seems to ultimate answer"". This confirms it's beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, the post mentions ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"". This constitutes a form of preparation and seeking a method, which aligns with elements of a plan for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action: ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope"". This is a clear, detailed description of what the poster *did*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and a desire to die (Step 2).
    - It describes a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life (""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope""). This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" Since the post describes a past concrete action and also mentions current planning (""searching about ways to kill myself""), 'Attempt' is the correct classification according to the provided rules.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""more dead inside"" (metaphorical, indicating emotional numbness/pain, not literal death/suicide intent). ""Im done with everything"" (can imply resignation or desire for things to end, but not explicitly life).
    - Emotional indicators: ""I dont understand why nobody cares about me at all,"" ""more dead inside,"" ""done being played with,"" ""done trying my best but getting no results,"" ""done with everything."" (Hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, feeling uncared for, emotional exhaustion).
    - Specific plans: None. No method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? The phrase ""Im done with everything"" expresses extreme frustration, exhaustion, and a desire for the current situation/struggle to end. However, it is not as direct or unambiguous as the examples provided for 'Ideation' such as ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I wish I could disappear,"" or ""I want it to be over"" (where ""it"" clearly refers to life). ""I'm done with everything"" could mean done with trying, done with relationships, done with the current circumstances, rather than explicitly done with life itself. The post conveys profound distress and a sense of giving up on current efforts, but not a clear, explicit desire to cease existing.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as a clear desire to die/suicidal intent (Step 2) was not established.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No past concrete actions are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant emotional distress, feelings of being uncared for, worthlessness, and exhaustion. These are general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life.
    - It does not contain any explicit suicide terms.
    - It also does not contain a *clear* and *unambiguous* desire to die or not be alive. The phrase ""Im done with everything"" is ambiguous and falls short of the explicit examples given for 'Ideation' (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I could disappear""). It aligns more with general expressions of profound distress and resignation.
    - Therefore, it best fits the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life...""

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrases ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window"" clearly imply a self-inflicted action intended to end life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""less scary,"" ""getting more courage"" indicate a struggle with the act but a determination to proceed, suggesting severe distress and intent.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""jump off,"" ""jump out of my bedroom window"" is a specific method.
        - Means: The ""bedroom window"" is the means.
        - Location: ""out of my bedroom window"" is a specific location. ""some trees and mud below"" further describes the environment for the planned act.
        - Specific timeframes: ""soon"" indicates an imminent timeframe.
        - Preparations: ""getting more courage"" suggests mental preparation for the act.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - However, the post contains unambiguous expressions of wanting to end life through the described action: ""I think I can jump off,"" ""I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window,"" ""Hopefully I can do it soon."" This clearly conveys a desire to die by this method. So, Yes, there is a clear desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, suicidal intent is present.
    - The post mentions a specific **method** (""jump off,"" ""jump out of my bedroom window"").
    - It mentions a specific **location** (""out of my bedroom window"").
    - It mentions a specific **timeframe** (""soon"").
    - It mentions a form of **preparation** (""getting more courage"").
    - All these elements align with the definition of a plan for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It describes a current intent and plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die through a specific action, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    - It includes not only the desire to die but also a specific plan with a method (""jump out of my bedroom window""), a location (""out of my bedroom window""), and a timeframe (""soon""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' precisely.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most accurate classification.

There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time.

This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""writing suicide notes"" is present. This is a direct mention of a preparation for suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""issues,"" ""low energy,"" ""depression hits really hard,"" ""I hate talking about myself,"" ""I'd just waste their time."" These indicate distress, hopelessness, and potential feelings of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans:** ""writing suicide notes"" is a clear indication of preparation for suicide. This falls under the 'Behavior' definition for ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent"" or ""preparations.""
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of a past concrete action to end their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? While not a direct statement of intent like ""I will kill myself,"" the act of ""writing suicide notes"" unambiguously implies suicidal intent and a desire to end one's life. It's a preparation for suicide.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? The context of ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" clearly links the severe distress to suicidal ideation and preparation. This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present, implicitly through preparation), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**? No.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"" is a form of preparation/means.
        *   A specific **location**? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**? No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"" is a very clear sign of preparation for suicide.
    *   Since there is a clear sign of preparation (""writing suicide notes""), this strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life? No. ""writing suicide notes"" refers to a current or recurrent action of preparing, not a past failed attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond 'Indicator' because ""writing suicide notes"" clearly indicates suicidal intent and preparation.
    *   It is not merely 'Ideation' because it describes a specific preparatory action (""writing suicide notes""), which falls under the definition of a ""plan"" for 'Behavior' (specifically, ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent"" or ""preparations"").
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action of an attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category due to the explicit mention of ""writing suicide notes"" as a preparation for suicide.

No one cares not even me if i get the things i sought and need its okay but if i dont i suddenly get all depressed there are people suffering from medical depression on this sub and you think your petty problems are enough to warrant sympathy from suicide watchers idk maybe i just need attention yes its all a ruse for attention. People dying is funny hope that asshole dies hope i die maybe then ill get a good chuckle fuck me fuck da world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""hope i die."" It also mentions ""People dying is funny.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""suffering mentally,"" ""suddenly get all depressed,"" ""No one cares,"" ""fuck me fuck da world"" indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and anger.
    *   **Specific plans:** There are no mentions of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There are no descriptions of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post does not use the exact words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   However, it contains a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die: ""hope i die."" This clearly indicates a desire to cease existing.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses a desire to die, but it does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., acquired tools), location (e.g., a specific bridge), timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or preparations (e.g., writing notes, giving things away). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. It focuses on current feelings and desires. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""hope i die""), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It lacks any specific plan elements (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action, distinguishing it from 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'Ideation' because it expresses a clear desire to die without a specific plan.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""Just cut to deep"" is a direct description of self-harm. The severity implied by ""to deep"" suggests a potentially life-threatening act or a serious attempt.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Ah."" and ""fuck"" indicate distress, pain, or regret immediately following the action.
    - Specific plans: No mention of a future plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) for suicide.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: Yes, ""Just cut to deep"" describes a specific, concrete action that has just occurred. This is a past action (even if very recent).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" etc.? No.
    - Other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die? No explicit statement like ""I want to die.""
    - *Self-correction:* While there's no explicit *desire to die* stated, the definition of 'Attempt' specifically focuses on the description of a *past concrete action* taken to try to end one's life. Severe self-harm, especially described as ""cut to deep,"" is often indicative of such an attempt, even if the explicit suicidal ideation isn't verbalized in the same post. The examples in the 'Attempt' definition (""when I tried to cut my wrists"") are very similar to the post's content.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - This step is for identifying *future* plans. The post describes a *past* action, not a future plan. Therefore, 'Behavior' is not the primary fit based on this step.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? Yes. ""Just cut to deep"" describes a specific, concrete act of self-harm that has just happened. The severity implied (""to deep"") suggests it was a serious act, consistent with a suicide attempt or a very severe self-harm act with suicidal intent. This aligns directly with the 'Attempt' definition and its examples (e.g., ""when I tried to cut my wrists"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post describes a specific, concrete act of self-harm that has just occurred (""Just cut to deep""). This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt', which states: ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life (e.g., 'when I tried to cut my wrists')."" The severity of the described action (""to deep"") strongly implies it was an attempt or a very serious self-harm act.

206,"This place should be made PRIVATE. I'm tired of all the people having the AUDACITY to come here, write some random fucking bullshit crap like ""don't do it!"" ""you have to live for everyone else!"" like OH MY FUCKING GOD YOU ARE SO HILARIOUS AND PATHETIC. As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice lmao. They only do that so they can feel good about themselves. ""Ah I'm such a good person"" they say to themselves. You're not. You're an attention hungry piece of shit that feeds off the misery of others",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post quotes phrases like ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"", which are typically associated with suicide prevention. However, the poster is using these phrases to express *frustration and anger* at people who say them, not to express their own suicidal intent. There are no direct mentions of suicide, self-harm, death, or dying by the poster.
    *   Emotional indicators: Anger, frustration, contempt, resentment, feeling misunderstood (""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice""). While there's implied distress, the primary emotions conveyed are negative feelings towards others.
    *   Specific plans: None.
    *   Past concrete actions: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No. The poster *quotes* phrases related to suicide prevention, but does not use them to express their own desire.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post expresses anger and a feeling of being misunderstood, but not a direct wish to die or cease existing. The phrase ""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice"" implies a difficult internal state, but does not explicitly state a desire for death.

    *   Since the answer to both is 'No', the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Not applicable, as there is no explicit suicidal intent or desire to die expressed by the poster.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Not applicable, as there is no description of a specific past concrete action taken by the poster to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress and anger, particularly towards others who offer what the poster perceives as unhelpful or performative advice in a context that strongly implies suicide prevention.
    *   However, the post itself *does not* contain any explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, a clear desire to die, a plan, or a past attempt from the perspective of the person writing the post.
    *   It fits the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... but no indication of self-inflicted intent or a wish to cease living.""
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit desire to die or suicidal thought expressed by the poster themselves. The focus is on their reaction to others.
    *   Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i kinda just wanna die""
    - Emotional indicators: ""i dont really know what i want"", ""struggle to get up"", ""find everything boring"", ""friends are the only thing keeping me going and i dont have many since they all left"", ""i get bullied so stopped attending school"", ""i dont have good grades"", ""idk what i should do"" (indicates hopelessness, anhedonia, social isolation, academic distress, confusion).
    - Specific plans: None mentioned (no method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations).
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The phrase ""i kinda just wanna die"" is a clear expression of a desire to die.
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - Does the post mention a specific method? No.
    - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
    - A specific location? No.
    - A specific timeframe? No.
    - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There is no specific plan or self-harming behavior intended to lead to suicide mentioned.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die (""i kinda just wanna die""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not contain any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) as defined for 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a specific past concrete action taken to end their life, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear desire to not be alive without a specific plan. The phrase ""but dont at the same time if you get me"" indicates ambivalence, which is common in ideation, but doesn't negate the explicit desire to die.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal thoughts"", ""justify dying"", ""thinking about partially planning to die"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""guilty"", ""anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse"", ""feel terrible"", ""terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive"".
    *   **Specific plans:** The post mentions ""thinking about partially planning to die"" but immediately follows it with ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips"". There are no specific methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No mention of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and a clear desire to die (""want to justify dying"", ""thinking about partially planning to die""). Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    *   Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No. While it mentions ""partially planning to die,"" it explicitly states, ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips,"" which indicates a *lack* of a specific, actionable plan as required for 'Behavior'. The criteria for 'Behavior' require *specific* elements of a plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""suicidal thoughts"", ""want to justify dying"") but explicitly states a lack of ""strong and reliable methods"" and does not detail any specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide. The phrase ""partially planning to die"" is too vague and contradicted by the lack of methods to qualify as a specific plan for 'Behavior'. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""better off dead,"" ""too scared to end it,"" ""now i really don't care any more,"" ""find a nice little spot to hang myself,"" ""then i can rest in peace.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""lost everything,"" ""no reason to keep going""), despair (""so tired of having everything decent or good in my life taken from me,"" ""no fucking reason to keep playing this bullshit game""), worthlessness (""ugly useless stupid girl,"" ""ugly 27 year old woman with no degree, no partner, no job, no reason to keep going"").
    - Specific plans: The post states, ""i've been thinking i could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself."" This includes a specific method (""hang myself"") and a specific location (""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot"").
    - Past concrete actions: The post mentions, ""ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears."" This describes past thoughts and fears, not a concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""better off dead"" and ""find a nice little spot to hang myself,"" and clear expressions of wanting to die/end life (""no reason to keep going,"" ""now i really don't care any more"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - The post clearly mentions:
        - A specific **method**: ""hang myself.""
        - A specific **location**: ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot.""
    - These elements constitute a specific plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life. The mention of being ""too scared to end it"" in the past refers to ideation/fear, not an actual attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to die and suicidal thoughts (Step 2 confirms it's not 'Indicator').
    - The post describes a specific plan, including a method (""hang myself"") and a location (""mountains... find a nice little spot"") (Step 3 confirms this points to 'Behavior').
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action of attempting suicide (Step 4 confirms it's not 'Attempt').
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification as it includes suicidal ideation with a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore."" These are direct expressions of a desire to die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't enjoy anything,"" ""I am lonely,"" ""I am not healing,"" ""It is terrible."" These indicate anhedonia, loneliness, despair, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described. The mention of ""seeking therapy and taking antidepressants"" refers to mental health treatment, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore"" are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/not be alive.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die expressed, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""But I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't know what to do anymore,"" ""it's just not working,"" ""Its so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on,"" ""I'm just tired of all of it."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans:** There are no mentions of a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe for an act (the ""when"" refers to when things will get better, not when an act will occur), or preparations.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There are no clear descriptions of past *concrete actions* taken to attempt suicide. The mention of ""its been years"" refers to the duration of suicidal thoughts, not past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts."" This confirms the presence of suicidal intent/desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on the confirmed suicidal intent, I look for elements of a plan.
    *   No specific method is mentioned.
    *   No specific means are mentioned as being acquired or possessed with intent.
    *   No specific location is mentioned.
    *   No specific timeframe for carrying out an act is mentioned.
    *   No clear signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   Since no elements of a plan are present, this rules out 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. It describes dealing with suicidal thoughts for years, but not an actual attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts,"" indicating a clear desire to die or suicidal ideation. This means it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
    - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm (direct and indirect language).
        - No direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
    - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, anhedonia, etc.).
        - ""fucked up self"", ""depression and anxiety"", ""scared"", ""literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore"", ""idk what to do"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and severe lack of motivation (anhedonia/apathy).
    - Look for specific plans: methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
        - No specific plans mentioned. The post is about needing therapy and the obstacles to getting it.
    - Check for clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.
        - No past concrete actions described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? (Yes/No)
        - No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want it all to end,"" ""I'm going to die soon"" when in a context of severe distress)? (Yes/No)
        - No. The post expresses severe distress, lack of motivation, and a desire to ""fix"" themselves through therapy, but not a desire to die or cease existing. The focus is on seeking help for their current state.
    - If 'No' to both of the above (i.e., no explicit suicide terms AND no other clear desire to die expressed), then the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as no suicidal intent or desire to die is expressed.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Not applicable, as no past concrete action is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, and strictly following the definitions below, which category fits best?
    - The post describes ""depression and anxiety"" and a severe lack of motivation (""don't even have the motivation to get up anymore""). These are general expressions of distress, sadness, and dissatisfaction with life.
    - There is no explicit expression concerning suicide.
    - There is no clear desire to die or end one's life. The user expresses a need for therapy to ""fix my fucked up self,"" indicating a desire to improve their life, not end it.
    - This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive..., it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'."" This post does not express a clear desire not to be alive.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""new suicide method"". The poster also references ""a woman who killed her husband"" which is the source of the method idea.
    - Emotional indicators: ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts"", ""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that"", ""*sigh*"", ""i wish i wasn't like this :("". These show distress, internal conflict, and a desire to not have these thoughts, but the thoughts are clearly present.
    - Specific plans: The post explicitly states, ""i'd be lying if i said that didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method 🧍‍♀️."" The method is described as ""putting eye drops in his beverages"" (which the poster is considering for themselves). This is a specific method.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""new suicide method"".
    - This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - Does the post also mention a specific method? Yes. The poster states they got ""an idea of a new suicide method"" and specifies it as ""putting eye drops in his beverages"". This is a specific method being considered.
    - No specific means being acquired, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned beyond the method itself. However, the presence of a specific method is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It discusses current thoughts and a potential future method.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""suicidal thoughts"").
    - It also clearly mentions a specific method for suicide (""new suicide method"" derived from ""putting eye drops in his beverages"").
    - This combination of suicidal ideation and a specific method fits the definition of 'Behavior'. It is not 'Ideation' because a specific method is present. It is not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described. It is not 'Indicator' because explicit suicidal thoughts and a method are present.

214,"I think I've come to realize I'm the common denominator in all of my problems. A month ago I wrote a suicide note. I realized the date when I was going through my screenshots and found the note, primed and ready to be posted on social media so nobody wonders why I stopped responding to calls or going to work. Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide note"", ""free myself of my problems"", ""blocking my own shot"", ""do it this time"" (in context of ending life).
    - Emotional indicators: ""common denominator in all of my problems"", ""sabotaged myself"", ""can't even fucking free myself"", ""felt so calm then"", ""coax the feeling back out"". These indicate despair, self-blame, and a longing for the calm associated with suicidal planning.
    - Specific plans: ""A month ago I wrote a suicide note."" (preparation/means). ""primed and ready to be posted on social media"" (preparation). ""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place."" (specific timeframe and location mentioned, and general planning). The final sentence ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" indicates a current re-engagement with the idea of executing this detailed plan.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""Then sabotaged myself."" This indicates they *did not* follow through with the plan; it's the opposite of a concrete action taken to end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, ""suicide note"" is an explicit mention.
    - Yes, ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" expresses a clear desire to die/end life, referring to the suicide.
    - Therefore, it's more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - The post mentions:
        - Specific **means/preparation**: ""wrote a suicide note"", ""primed and ready to be posted"".
        - A specific **location**: ""Picked a time and place."" (Yes, location mentioned).
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""Picked a time and place."" (Yes, timeframe mentioned).
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: ""wrote a suicide note"", ""primed and ready"".
    - The past detailed planning (""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Wrote a suicide note"") is explicitly stated. The concluding sentence, ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time,"" indicates a current desire to act on that previously detailed plan, suggesting the plan is still active or being re-activated. This goes beyond mere ideation and includes elements of a specific plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post describes ""Then sabotaged myself."" This is not a description of a concrete action taken to end their life; rather, it describes a failure to act on the plan. Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It describes a detailed past plan (""wrote a suicide note,"" ""planned everything out,"" ""picked a time and place"") and expresses a current desire to execute that plan (""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time""). This combination of detailed planning (even if past) and current intent to act on it fits the 'Behavior' definition, which requires explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mention of a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations).
    - It is not 'Attempt' because no concrete action to end life was described; the poster explicitly stated they ""sabotaged"" themselves.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay. I am hanging on by threads at this moment. trying to find things in the world to enjoy like I did when i was much younger. As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""self-harm."" The phrase ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" is present, which is an indirect expression related to non-existence and worthlessness.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""suffering,"" ""don't feel it will ever end,"" ""utter hell,"" ""alone and forgotten,"" ""just a stain upon the world,"" ""crying,"" ""forsaken,"" ""pain,"" ""tension,"" ""rotten pit,"" ""outcast,"" ""hanging on by threads,"" ""endless pain,"" ""fading memory."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and emotional exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. The phrase ""I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister"" is not a suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? The phrase ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" in the context of extreme suffering, feeling like a ""stain upon the world,"" and stating ""I am hanging on by threads at this moment"" strongly implies a desire to cease existing or for the suffering to end permanently, which aligns with ""a clear desire to not be alive any longer"" or ""I want it to be over"" as per the 'Ideation' definition. It goes beyond general distress to contemplate their non-existence.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): Does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No. The post is entirely focused on the emotional state and past experiences, without any indication of a plan to act on these feelings.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There is no description of a past attempt (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to cut myself"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear desire to not be alive/for suffering to end (implied by ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone,"" ""hanging on by threads,"" and overwhelming pain/hopelessness), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action to end their life, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes... a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

I can tell you who to ask and they'll assure you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to die"", ""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm done with life"", ""all I cause is pain"".
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself"".
        - Means: ""my broken car"" (implied as part of the method), ""a tree"".
        - Location: ""from a tree"".
        - Specific timeframes: ""So Tuesday"".
        - Preparations: None explicitly stated, but the detailed plan itself suggests preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""want to die"" and ""I'm done with life"", which are clear expressions of wanting to die. This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific **method**: ""slit my wrist"" and ""hang myself"". (Yes)
        - Specific **means**: ""my broken car"" (in conjunction with slitting wrists) and ""a tree"". (Yes)
        - A specific **location**: ""from a tree"". (Yes)
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""So Tuesday"". (Yes)
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: While not explicitly ""writing a note"", the detailed plan with method, means, location, and specific day is a strong indicator of planning.
    - Since multiple elements of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe) are present, this strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post describes future actions (""So Tuesday, I'm either going to...""), not specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""want to die"", ""I'm done with life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post does not describe a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a specific plan including:
        - Specific methods (""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself"")
        - Specific means (""my broken car"", ""a tree"")
        - A specific location (""from a tree"")

217,"Having a lot of suicidal thoughts but I dont think im depressed. Throwaway because people I know, know my main acc. Turned 17 in Jan. Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" - direct mention of suicide.
        *   ""it would be better if I was dead"" - clear desire to die.
        *   ""suicide is selfish,"" ""suicide would be better"" - direct mentions of suicide.
        *   ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please."" - unambiguous expression of wanting to cease existing/die.
        *   ""next morning I'm dead?"" and ""I present to you a dead son"" - hypothetical scenarios related to suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post describes a deep internal struggle despite external positive circumstances. Feelings of emptiness (""right after I feel empty""), questioning the point of life (""Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end?""), and a sense of abnormality (""Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong"").
    *   **Specific plans:** There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., ""I have the pills ready""), location (e.g., ""that bridge""), specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week,"" ""at 21""), or preparations (e.g., ""writing notes,"" ""giving away things""). The post focuses on the *thoughts* and the *reasons* for stopping.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There is no description of any past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. The anecdote about the robbery describes a threat from an external source, not a self-inflicted action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""suicide.""
    *   Yes, there are other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/not be alive: ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please.""
    *   Since there are explicit mentions and clear desires, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No. The post discusses the *thoughts* and *desire* to die, and the *reasons* for *not* acting on them (e.g., dog, family, friends), but not a plan to do so.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post discusses current thoughts and feelings, not past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"") and a clear desire to die (""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.

218,"Hotline where they can't track me or call the police to come to me?. Last time I called a hotline just to have someone to talk to (didn't have a method or anything), I ended up having the cops called on me and they came to my dorm room and I got stuck in a psych ward for 3 days. It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there"" is a direct mention of being suicidal.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""worried,"" ""paranoid,"" ""irrational"" (self-assessment), indicating distress and anxiety.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post explicitly states, regarding a past event, that the person ""didn't have a method or anything."" Crucially, there is *no mention* of a current method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide in the present context. The user is asking for a hotline that won't track them, implying a desire to talk about distress without intervention, not to execute a plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The post describes a past event where cops were called and they were ""stuck in a psych ward."" This is a consequence of seeking help, not a description of a concrete action taken to attempt suicide (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut myself""). The statement ""didn't have a method or anything"" further clarifies that no attempt was made during that previous incident.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""It made me 10x more suicidal."" This directly indicates suicidal thoughts/feelings are present or exacerbated. This meets the criteria for 'Ideation' (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post does *not* mention any specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for a *current* suicide plan. It explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" in reference to the *last time* they called a hotline. There is no indication of a current plan. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post describes being sent to a psych ward after calling a hotline, but it does *not* describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). In fact, it states ""didn't have a method or anything"" in the context of the previous hotline call. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly uses the term ""suicidal"" (""10x more suicidal""), indicating the presence of suicidal thoughts or feelings. This means it is beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, it does not describe any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) for suicide, nor does it describe a past concrete action of attempting suicide.
    *   Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category, as it expresses suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan or a description of a past attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post directly references ""actually suicidal"" in relation to the poster's own state. It also mentions ""until I die"" in the context of others not believing their distress.
    - Emotional indicators: Extreme anger (""FUCK OFF"", ""I FUCKING HATE IT"", ""rage"", ""angers me""), despair (""trying to fucking hold on to whatever the hell I have left""), feeling unheard/neglected (""They don't care. They won't believe it until I die."", ""BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""feel like killing my self every day"", ""this might be my final good bye"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""so lonely"", ""so fucking tired"", ""no more strenght"", ""it huts so much"", ""Im sad to say this"", ""dissapointed"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Methods:** Not explicitly stated (e.g., no mention of pills, jumping, etc.).
        *   **Means/Preparations:** ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"". This clearly indicates preparations, specifically writing a suicide note and getting affairs in order (bills, testament).
        *   **Locations:** Not stated.
        *   **Specific timeframes:** ""this might be my final good bye"" implies an imminent timeframe.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer"" is not a description of a past suicide attempt (a concrete action taken to end life), but rather a statement about past feelings or attempts to cope.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions: ""feel like killing my self every day"" and ""this might be my final good bye"" (a clear desire to end life). This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post *does* mention:
        *   Specific **means/preparations**: ""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"". This directly aligns with the 'Behavior' definition's examples of ""I've written a suicide note"" and ""getting my affairs in order"".
        *   A specific **timeframe**: ""this might be my final good bye"" suggests the act is imminent.
    *   Since there are clear elements of preparation and an implied imminent timeframe, it strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No. The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance"" is not a description of a past physical attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""killing my self every day"", ""final good bye""), so it's beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete suicide attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   It explicitly mentions preparations for suicide (""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"") and an implied imminent timeframe (""final good bye""). These elements fall under the definition of a ""plan"" for 'Behavior'. Therefore, it is 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation' (which lacks a specific plan).

222,"I'm holding it all in and i'm about to explode. I feel like I can't keep it to myself anymore or else i'm going to kms. I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting. I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog. I haven't talked to anyone in a long while and everyone thinks i'm ok. I'm not though. I don't know what to do anymore. I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly uses ""kms"" (kill myself) multiple times: ""or else i'm going to kms,"" ""i'm going to kill myself very soon,"" ""I'm about to kms,"" and ""I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon."" It also mentions self-harm: ""I can't stop cutting.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm holding it all in and i'm about to explode,"" ""I can't keep it to myself anymore,"" ""I'm not ok,"" ""I don't know what to do anymore."" These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and feeling overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   Methods: None mentioned (e.g., no mention of pills, jumping, etc.).
        *   Means: None mentioned (e.g., no mention of acquiring tools, writing notes, etc.).
        *   Locations: None mentioned.
        *   Timeframes: ""very soon,"" ""soon,"" ""just not yet though I can't leave my dog."" The post explicitly states, ""I'm not sure when but I know I am."" This indicates a lack of a *specific* timeframe, even though the intent is for the near future. The ""not yet"" due to the dog is a reason for deferral, not a specific plan for *when* it will happen.
        *   Preparations: None mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""I can't stop cutting"" refers to an ongoing behavior, not a past *attempt* to end life (e.g., ""I tried to cut my wrists to die""). There is no description of a specific past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kms"" and ""kill myself"" multiple times, along with a clear acceptance of the desire to die (""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses strong suicidal intent and a sense of immediacy (""very soon,"" ""soon""). However, it explicitly states ""I'm not sure when but I know I am,"" which means there is no *specific timeframe* for the act. There is also no mention of a specific method, means, location, or preparations. While ""cutting"" is mentioned, it's described as an ongoing struggle (""I can't stop cutting"") rather than a specific *method* being planned for suicide as per the 'Behavior' definition (e.g., ""I'm going to take all these pills""). The lack of a specific method, means, location, or a *specific* timeframe prevents classification as 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. ""I can't stop cutting"" describes current or ongoing self-harm, not a past suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""kms,"" ""kill myself,"" ""I'm going to kill myself very soon""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a specific past concrete action to end life, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The key distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Behavior' requires a *specific plan* (method, means, location, *specific* timeframe, or preparations). The post explicitly states ""I'm not sure when,"" indicating the absence of a specific timeframe. It also lacks any specific method, means, location, or preparations. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' which includes explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to die but without a specific plan.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I wanna kill myself"" (direct expression of suicidal intent)
        *   ""ruin their lives by killing myself even more"" (direct expression of suicidal intent and motivation)
        *   ""one of my suicide notes I threw away"" (direct mention of suicide notes, which are a form of preparation)
        *   ""if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them"" (indirect reference to suicide)
        *   ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" (direct expression of suicidal intent with a specific method and timeframe)
        *   ""the burden of my death on their shoulders"" (indirect reference to suicide)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Anger, resentment, despair, feeling burdened, lack of care for others' feelings (""I don't care"").
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"": This is a specific *method* (""shoot myself"") and a specific *timeframe* (""on the spot"").
        *   ""one of my suicide notes I threw away"": This indicates *preparation* for suicide, even if the notes were discarded. It shows a history of planning/preparing.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of a past *attempt* (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I cut myself""). The suicide notes are preparations, not attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""I wanna kill myself"" and ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot,"" which are unambiguous expressions of wanting to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post mentions:
        *   A specific **method**: ""shoot myself"".
        *   A specific **timeframe**: ""on the spot"".
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: ""one of my suicide notes I threw away"". Even though they were thrown away, the act of writing them is a preparation.
    *   The presence of these elements (method, timeframe, preparation) strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""Suicide notes I threw away"" is a preparation, not an attempt. There is no mention of ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to hang myself,"" etc.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""wish I could shoot myself""). This means it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes elements of a specific plan: a method (""shoot myself"") and a timeframe (""on the spot""). Additionally, the mention of ""suicide notes I threw away"" points to past preparation for suicide. These elements fulfill the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Think I'm going to OD today"", ""suicide"", ""popping all of them at once and hope for the best"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""can't feel anything right now"", ""it's all I can think about"".
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""OD"", ""popping all of them at once"".
        - Means: ""a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"".
        - Timeframe: ""today"".
        - Location: Not specified.
        - Preparations: Having the medication and stating intent for ""today"" implies preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: The post mentions ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"" which refers to past ideation, not a concrete action/attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""Think I'm going to OD today"" and ""popping all of them at once and hope for the best"" clearly express a desire to die.
    - Since 'Yes' to both, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific **method**: Yes, ""OD"", ""popping all of them at once"".
        - Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: Yes, ""a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"".
        - A specific **location** being considered for suicide: No.
        - A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide: Yes, ""today"".
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: Yes, having the specific medications and stating intent for ""today"" indicates preparation.
    - Since there is a specific method, means, and timeframe mentioned, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life? No. ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"" describes past ideation, not a concrete action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""suicide"", ""going to OD today""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not describe a specific past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - The post includes a specific plan:
        - Method: Overdose (""OD"", ""popping all of them at once"").
        - Means: Specific medications (""venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"").
        - Timeframe: ""today"".
    - These elements perfectly align with the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""The end is the only thing that feels right now."" This is a strong, unambiguous expression of wanting to end one's life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""nothing left,"" ""completely used up,"" ""Sorry I wasn't a better person"" indicate hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and regret.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"") is mentioned.
    - Preparations: ""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt and thank you to those who brought any light into my life. Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson. I'm sorry I wasn't a better person."" These are clear farewells and apologies, which are strong signs of preparation, akin to writing a suicide note or getting affairs in order.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No explicit use of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" combined with the farewells (""Love you Mom, Dad..."") is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to end their life. This is clearly beyond general distress.

    Since there is a clear desire to die/end life, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? Yes. The farewells (""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson"") and apologies (""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt,"" ""Sorry I wasn't a better person"") are strong signs of preparation, functioning as a final message or suicide note, which falls under ""getting my affairs in order"" or ""I've written a suicide note"" as examples of preparation for 'Behavior'. The post itself is a form of final communication.

    Because there is a clear desire to die AND strong signs of preparation (farewells/final message), it fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's a clear desire to end life (""The end is the only thing that feels right now"").
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.
    - It's more than 'Ideation' because, in addition to the desire to die, there are clear signs of preparation in the form of farewells and apologies, which constitute a final message/note. This goes beyond mere thoughts or desires and indicates active steps towards ending life (preparing a final communication). This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition's inclusion of ""getting my affairs in order"" or ""I've written a suicide note.""

Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I was already suicidal"", ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""feel so bad"", ""feel terrible terrible"", ""My mind is going crazy"", ""incredibly overwhelmed"", ""can't even cry"".
    - Specific plans: ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific method.
    - Past concrete actions: No specific past concrete actions are described. ""I was already suicidal"" refers to a past state of mind, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit term ""suicidal"".
    - Yes, there is an unambiguous expression of wanting to end thoughts/existence through a specific self-harming act: ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"".
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - The post mentions a specific **method** for suicide: ""cutting my god damn throat"". This clearly fits the definition of a specific method under 'Behavior'.
    - No specific means, location, timeframe, or preparations are explicitly mentioned beyond the method itself. However, the presence of a specific method is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""I was already suicidal and depressed"" refers to a past state of being, not a described attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""suicidal"" and expresses a clear desire to end thoughts/existence. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat"") for carrying out the suicidal thoughts. This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

227,"Quote about suicide. I recently stumbled upon this quote that said something along the lines of ""if you want to kill yourself you might as well keep going cause it doenst matter"" much more beautifully phrased thought. Anyone know more about it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
    - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm (direct and indirect language). The post mentions ""kill yourself"" within a quote the user is referencing.
    - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, anhedonia, etc.). No emotional indicators are present from the user themselves. The user is asking for information about a quote.
    - Look for specific plans: None.
    - Check for clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill yourself"" is present, but it is part of a quote the user is inquiring about, not an expression of their own suicidal intent.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The user is asking for more information about a quote, not expressing a desire to die or suicidal ideation.
    - Since the explicit mention of ""kill yourself"" is within a quote being discussed, and not a direct expression of the user's own intent or desire to die, this post does not contain the user's own explicit suicide mention or clear desire to die. Therefore, based on the definitions, it is likely 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - No suicidal intent/desire to die is present from the user, so this step is not applicable. There is no plan mentioned.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No past concrete actions are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, and strictly following the definitions below, which category fits best?
    - The user is quoting a phrase that includes ""kill yourself"" but is not expressing their own suicidal thoughts or desire to die. They are merely asking for more information about the quote.
    - 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive... it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'.""
    - In this case, the user is not expressing a clear desire to die or explicit suicidal thoughts *of their own*. The mention of ""kill yourself"" is contextualized as part of a quote they stumbled upon and are seeking more information about. This does not indicate personal suicidal intent or ideation from the user.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", ""ready to join my dog"", ""i can't do this anymore"". These are direct expressions of a desire to die or cease existing.
    - Emotional indicators: ""not happy anymore"", ""never been truly happy"", ""my life so difficult"", ""give up on everything"", ""endless loop"", ""my life will never get better"", ""i've accepted that"". These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and a sense of futility.
    - Specific plans: No mention of a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of a past suicide attempt (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No explicit use of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""i want to leave earth,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""ready to join my dog,"" ""i can't do this anymore"" are all clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or cease existing.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'. Proceed to analyze for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There are no elements of a specific plan mentioned.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post talks about current feelings and readiness (""i'm ready to join my dog""), but does not describe any specific past action taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and not be alive (""i want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", ""ready to join my dog"", ""i can't do this anymore""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.

My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""My grandpa passed away,"" ""I was going to kill myself,"" ""losing her father,"" ""loss of a child,"" ""his time to go,"" ""his passing has saved my life.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My mom is already doing awful,"" ""couldn't add the loss of a child,"" ""don't ever want to make my mother cry."" The poster's *past* state is implied to be one of severe distress leading to suicidal planning. The *current* state is one of relief from that immediate plan and a newfound ""appreciation for my life.""
    *   **Specific plans:** ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" This describes a *past* specific timeframe for a plan. Crucially, the post then states: ""Now, I know I can't do that."" and ""his passing has saved my life for the time being."" This explicitly negates the *current* existence of that plan.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of a past *concrete action* taken to attempt suicide. ""I was going to kill myself"" describes a past *intention/plan*, not an action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""I was going to kill myself."" While this was a past intention, it is clearly stated. The post then describes how this intention has been averted for the time being.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post *does* mention a past plan with a specific timeframe (""before Christmas hit"").
    *   However, the definition for 'Behavior' requires the post to ""include explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/a desire to die... AND ALSO mentions... a plan to commit suicide."" The crucial part is the *current* state. The post explicitly states ""Now, I know I can't do that"" and ""his passing has saved my life for the time being."" This indicates that the previously mentioned plan is *not* currently active or being pursued. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no *current* plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action. ""I was going to kill myself"" describes a past *intention* or *plan*, not an action taken (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** No, because there is explicit mention of ""kill myself"" and a clear past desire to die.
    *   **Attempt:** No, because no concrete past action is described. The post describes a past *plan*, not a past *attempt*.
    *   **Behavior:** No. While a past plan with a timeframe is mentioned, the post explicitly states that this plan is *no longer active* (""Now, I know I can't do that,"" ""his passing has saved my life for the time being""). The 'Behavior' category requires a *current* plan or self-harming behavior intended to lead to suicide.
    *   **Ideation:** Yes. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I was going to kill myself""). It then describes a situation where a past plan has been averted, meaning there is *no current specific plan to commit suicide*. The underlying issues might still be present (""Nothing has changed for me""), but the immediate suicidal intent and plan have been put on hold. This fits the 'Ideation' definition: explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings without a *current* specific plan.

230,"Am I faking my depression?. Ok so for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days. My home life isnt that good. Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""serious thoughts about suicide for days"", ""When we fight I always think about suicide"", ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"", ""thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My home life isnt that good"", ""Me and my mom fight alot"", ""This get me so mad"", ""social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression"", ""I feel like i'm doing it for attention"", ""makes me feel like i'm faking it"", ""Am i being dramatic about this?"".
    *   **Specific plans:** The post states, ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"". This indicates an exploration of methods, but not the selection of a specific method, acquisition of means, a specific location, or a specific timeframe for an act. It's about *researching ways*, not having a *plan* to execute one.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" and a clear desire to ""want to commit suicide"". This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    *   The post mentions ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself"". This is a thought process about *how* to commit suicide, but it does not specify a chosen method, acquired means, a specific location, a specific timeframe, or any preparations. It's an exploration of possibilities, not a concrete plan. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a *specific* method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation. The current statement doesn't meet this specificity.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' hinges on the presence of a *specific plan*. While the user is ""researching ways,"" this does not constitute a *specific method*, *acquired means*, *specific timeframe*, or *location* as required for 'Behavior'. It's still in the realm of contemplating and exploring the *idea* of suicide and its methods, rather than having a defined plan. Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation'.

231,Life is useless. I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being. Death and suicide need to be normalized,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""Death and suicide need to be normalized.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Life is useless"" indicates hopelessness and despair.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide.""
    - Yes, the phrase ""Life is useless"" and the desire for a state without ""thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being"" implies a clear desire to cease current existence.
    - Since explicit suicide terms are present, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post does not mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide. It discusses a philosophical view of death and suicide, but not a personal plan to act.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" and a clear expression of distress and a desire for a different state of being (""Life is useless,"" ""a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - However, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) described, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings (""suicide"") and a clear desire to not be alive (""Life is useless,"" desire for a non-existent state) without a specific plan.

232,Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?. To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight. Isn't it just beautiful?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post directly mentions ""the thought of death"" and describes its perceived benefits: ""To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight.""
    - Emotional indicators: Implied deep pain, exhaustion (""holding on so tight""), and a desire for cessation of suffering and existence.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life"": No.
    - OR, other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: Yes. While not explicitly saying ""I want to die,"" the post romanticizes death as a release from pain and hassle (""Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?"", ""To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing...""). This strongly implies a desire for non-existence or to cease living as an escape from suffering. This goes beyond general distress and indicates a clear desire not to be alive in the current state. According to the 'Ideation' definition, ""a clear desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., 'I want to disappear', 'I want it to be over')"" is sufficient. The post's sentiment aligns with this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No. The post discusses the *concept* and *appeal* of death, but not how it would be achieved.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire for the state of death as an escape from pain and existence, which qualifies as a clear desire to not be alive, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' category, as it contains expressions of thoughts/feelings about death as a desirable state to end suffering, without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."", ""the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore."", ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""feeling like absolute shit"", ""fucking outcast"", ""so fucking tired"", ""stuck in my head"", ""will to live like this is hanging by a thread"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method:** ""i'll use any method i can"" - While not a specific named method, it clearly states the intent to find and use *a* method.
        *   **Means:** Not explicitly mentioned.
        *   **Location:** Not explicitly mentioned.
        *   **Specific timeframes:** ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" This links the action to a specific future event (getting COVID results). ""as long as i don't see another day"" implies immediacy once the condition is met.
        *   **Preparations:** Not explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""committing suicide,"" along with a clear desire to ""not see another day."" This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post mentions a specific **timeframe/trigger**: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" This is a conditional but clear future event tied to the suicidal act.
    *   The post mentions the intent to use a **method**: ""i'll use any method i can"". While not a specific *type* of method, it expresses a clear intention to find and employ one. This goes beyond mere ideation.
    *   These elements (specific conditional timeframe and intent to use a method) are sufficient to classify as 'Behavior' according to the definition.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. It mentions past fear of death, but not a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   It expresses a clear desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""don't see another day"") AND includes elements of a plan: a specific conditional timeframe (""if I'm positive, I'll kill myself"") and a stated intent to use ""any method I can."" This meets the criteria for 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I cant fucking kill myself properly"", ""kill myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Failrure"", ""burden"", ""disappointment"", ""Pleasw help, i have nobody else"" (hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, isolation).
    *   Specific plans: The post asks ""What shoul i do kill mslef"", which indicates a desire for a future plan, but no specific method, means, location, or timeframe is provided *by the poster*.
    *   Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" - This is a clear description of a specific past action taken with suicidal intent.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""I cant fucking kill myself properly"", and a clear desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   While the poster asks ""What shoul i do kill mslef"", implying a desire for a future plan, they do not *provide* a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation themselves for a *future* act. The primary concrete information given is about a *past* action. If they had said ""I'm going to try X tonight"" or ""I have Y ready now"", it would be Behavior. The question itself is not a plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post clearly describes a specific past concrete action: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"". This fits the definition of 'Attempt' perfectly, as it details *what* the poster did in a past attempt to end their life. The definition states: ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life (e.g., 'I overdosed last year,' 'when I tried to cut my wrists,' 'my failed attempt with pills five months ago')."" This matches. The rule also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" Here, the post describes a past attempt and asks for a future plan, so 'Attempt' takes precedence.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly expresses suicidal intent and a desire to die.
    *   Crucially, it describes a specific, concrete past action taken to attempt suicide (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone""). This directly aligns with the 'Attempt' definition. Even though there's a question about future action, the description of the past attempt is the most definitive element.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I might kill myself."" (Direct mention of suicide)
    - Emotional indicators: ""Hell,"" ""lesser human,"" ""fucking pisses me off,"" ""feeling like I'm trying to navigate through Hell every fucking day,"" ""I feel like I don't belong in society."" (Indicates significant distress, despair, alienation, and anger).
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""I might kill myself"" is a statement of possibility/consideration, not a plan.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""I might kill myself."" This clearly indicates suicidal intent/thoughts.
    - Since there is an explicit mention of suicide, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal intent (""I might kill myself"").
    - However, it does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means being acquired, a specific location, a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or any preparations. The phrase ""I might"" indicates contemplation rather than a concrete plan.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""I might kill myself"") and a clear desire to not belong/live in society.
    - It lacks any specific plan elements (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation).
    - It does not describe a past concrete attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Goodbye"", ""end it"", ""will be non existent"". These clearly indicate a desire to end life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""struggling with depression"".
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another while bottle of Advil."" This is a specific method (overdose).
        - Means: ""a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another while bottle of Advil."" These are specific means.
        - Timeframe: ""tonight"", ""in about a few minutes."" This is a very specific and imminent timeframe.
        - Preparations: ""Goodbye world."" Implies saying goodbyes.
    - Past concrete actions: No mention of past concrete actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/end life: ""I'm going to end it"", ""I will be non existent"". Yes.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): Yes, the post mentions a specific method (""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another while bottle of Advil""), specific means (the bottles of medication), and a specific, imminent timeframe (""tonight"", ""in about a few minutes"").
    - The presence of these elements of a plan strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post describes a current, imminent plan, not a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. So, no.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to end life (""end it"", ""will be non existent""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It includes not only suicidal thoughts/desire but also a very specific plan, including method, means, and a precise, imminent timeframe. This fits the definition of 'Behavior' perfectly.
    - It does not describe a *past concrete action* of an attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of a specific plan rules out 'Ideation'.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Behavior'.

    - Specific plans: There are no specific plans mentioned. In fact, the post explicitly states the absence of current suicidal intent (""not about doing it!"").
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: Yes, ""one month from my last suicide attempt"" is a direct and clear reference to a past concrete action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide attempt"" and ""suicidal thoughts"".
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No, the post explicitly states the opposite (""not about doing it!"", ""suicidal thoughts... are gone"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2: While explicit suicide terms are present, they refer to past events/thoughts. There is no current desire to die or a plan. The post clearly indicates the *absence* of a current plan or intent. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

    - Specific plans: The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" No method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. The phrase ""I can't take it anymore"" combined with ""drowning in these awful thoughts"" about ""hurt myself"" clearly indicates a desire to end the distress, and the ""awful thoughts"" themselves are about self-harm/suicide. This goes beyond general distress and points to suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation is mentioned. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. It refers to current ""awful thoughts"" but no past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear expression of suicidal thoughts (""drowning in these awful thoughts"" about ""hurt myself"") and severe distress (""I can't take it anymore""). This means it is more than 'Indicator'.
    - It explicitly states ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself,"" which means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe any past concrete actions, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts/feelings (""awful thoughts"" about ""hurt myself"") and a desire for the distress to end (""I can't take it anymore""), but without a specific plan.

241,"I'm so afraid to die but I fucking hate being alive. Yesterday my mom woke me up after work and I was having a dream and after I woke up I felt so fucking angry. I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual! Hopefully the roof collapses or my matress turns into a large mouth and eats me or some stupid shit I don't even know why I typed this out",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I'm so afraid to die but I fucking hate being alive."" (Clear desire not to be alive)
        *   ""I want to die or reverse time"" (Explicit desire to die)
        *   ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time"" (Frequent thoughts of dying)
        *   ""I haven't died because of the old 'your parents will be sad dummy' thing."" (Acknowledges suicidal thoughts)
        *   ""Hopefully the roof collapses or my matress turns into a large mouth and eats me or some stupid shit"" (Passive death wish, but not self-inflicted intent)
        *   ""I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head."" (Self-harm ideation, but explicitly states it's *in their head* and they've *never purposely hurt themselves*).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself""), despair, worthlessness (""pathetic,"" ""man baby""), anhedonia (""I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore""), extreme distress, self-loathing.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The self-harm ideation is explicitly stated as being internal (""in my head"") and not acted upon.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The post explicitly states, ""I've never purposely hurt myself,"" which rules out a past self-harm action. ""I was hospitalized in highschool for depression"" is a past mental health hospitalization, not a described suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die: ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   No. The post does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take all these pills,"" ""jumping off the bridge""), specific means being acquired or possessed (e.g., ""bought a gun,"" ""have the pills ready""), a specific location, a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my 21st birthday""), or clear signs of preparation (e.g., ""writing my suicide note,"" ""giving away my things""). The self-harm ideation is explicitly stated as not being acted upon and occurring ""in my head.""

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No. The post explicitly states, ""I've never purposely hurt myself."" While there's a mention of being ""hospitalized in highschool for depression,"" this is not described as a concrete suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die and frequent thoughts of dying (satisfying the 'Ideation' criteria, and ruling out 'Indicator').
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) for suicide, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide; in fact, the post explicitly states ""I've never purposely hurt myself,"" which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings or a clear desire to not be alive, without any specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" - This is a clear expression of a desire for death.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""hurting,"" ""hurt so bad emotionally,"" ""so depressed,"" ""exhausting,"" ""my own body is giving up.""
    *   Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or preparation for *committing* suicide. The timeframe ""tonight"" is mentioned, but in the context of a passive wish (""hoping I will die in my sleep""), not an active plan to cause death.
    *   Past concrete actions: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die/cease existing.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method** for suicide: No. ""die in my sleep"" is a passive hope, not a method the person intends to *use* to end their life.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: No.
        *   A specific **location** being considered for suicide: No.
        *   A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide: ""tonight"" is a timeframe, but it's linked to a passive wish (""hoping I will die in my sleep""), not an active plan to *commit* suicide. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a plan to *commit* suicide.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: No.
    *   The post expresses a desire for death to occur, but not an active plan to *cause* it. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I'm really hoping I will die in my sleep tonight""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a specific past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The crucial distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. While a timeframe (""tonight"") is present, the action described is a passive wish for death (""hoping I will die in my sleep""), not an active plan to *commit* suicide (i.e., no method, means, or active preparation to bring about death). Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' which includes a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""Zoloft overdose"" and ""wasn't enough to kill me,"" which clearly indicates an action taken with suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post focuses on the physical aftermath and a question about health, rather than emotional state.
    *   **Specific plans:** No current plans are mentioned. The post describes a past event.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""at 11:30 I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"" is a very specific and concrete description of a past action taken to try to end their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" explicitly indicates a past desire to die and the intent behind the action.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   No, the post describes a *past* action, not a *current* plan or intent for future action.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post describes a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life: ""at 11:30 I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg and It obviously wasn't enough to kill me"". This fits the definition of 'Attempt' perfectly.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes a clear, specific past concrete action taken with the intent to end one's life (""took 6 pills... wasn't enough to kill me""). This directly matches the definition for 'Attempt'. It is not 'Indicator' or 'Ideation' because a concrete action was taken. It is not 'Behavior' because it describes a past action, not a current plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", ""at peace knowing it's soon"", ""Hope my plan works"", ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"". The phrase ""Hope my plan works"" is a very strong indicator of suicidal intent and planning.
    - Emotional indicators: ""chronic stress"", ""hellish trauma"", ""beaten up the one thing I had going good, my health"", ""severe chronic fatigue syndrome"", ""have to sign up for disability"". These show significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed by life circumstances. ""I feel so calm about it. At peace knowing it's soon"" indicates a resolved decision towards ending life.
    - Specific plans: The post explicitly states ""Hope my plan works"". While the details of the method, means, or location are not given, the *existence* of a plan is directly stated. ""It's soon"" also indicates a timeframe, suggesting immediacy.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No direct use of these exact terms.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" ""At peace knowing it's soon,"" ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up,"" and especially ""Hope my plan works"" all clearly express a desire to end their life.
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present):
        - A specific **method**: Not explicitly stated.
        - Specific **means**: Not explicitly stated.
        - A specific **location**: Not explicitly stated.
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""it's soon"" indicates a timeframe, even if not precise (e.g., ""tonight""). This, combined with ""made my decision"" and ""at peace knowing it's soon"", suggests an imminent and decided action.
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: The explicit mention of ""my plan"" (""Hope my plan works"") is a direct indication of planning. The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/a desire to die... AND ALSO mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". The phrase ""Hope my plan works"" directly fulfills this criterion.
    - Conclusion: Yes, the post mentions a plan (""my plan"") and a timeframe (""it's soon""). This strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post refers to a current decision and future plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (Step 2), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The post does not describe a past concrete action (Step 4), ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The post explicitly mentions the existence of ""my plan"" and a timeframe (""it's soon""). According to the definition of 'Behavior', this is sufficient, even if the specific details of the method/means are not provided. The phrase ""Hope my plan works"" directly indicates a plan is in place. This goes beyond mere 'Ideation' (thoughts/desire without a plan).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide forum.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Hopeless,"" ""felt hopeless for months,"" ""realizing you're hopeless is too much.""
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. Seeking a ""suicide forum"" is information gathering, not a plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains an explicit mention of ""suicide"" (""suicide forum"").
    - The desire to find a ""suicide forum"" in the context of extreme hopelessness (""realizing you're hopeless is too much,"" ""I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better"") indicates a clear desire to explore options related to ending one's life, even if not explicitly stating ""I want to die.""
    - Since there is an explicit mention of ""suicide"" and a clear desire implied, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post mentions seeking a ""suicide forum."" This is a search for information or community, not a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for carrying out suicide. There is no plan as defined in the 'Behavior' category.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's an explicit mention of ""suicide"" and a clear implied desire to explore suicide.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) mentioned. Seeking a forum is not a plan of action for suicide itself.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.
    - It fits 'Ideation' because it includes an explicit expression related to suicide (""suicide forum"") and a clear desire to explore ending one's life (implied by the context and the search for the forum), but without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""trying to slash my wrists and die"" and ""want an end"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""disgusting to look at,"" ""low my expectations,"" ""Why couldn't I get even that?"", ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists"" indicate severe self-worth issues, hopelessness, despair, and immediate distress.
    *   **Specific plans:** ""slash my wrists"" is a specific method. ""on the verge of trying"" indicates immediate intent or being close to acting on the plan.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""I tried, I guess."" is too vague. It does not describe a specific concrete action taken to attempt suicide. It could refer to trying to escape parents or other struggles mentioned. It does not meet the criteria for a past *suicide attempt action*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of wanting to ""die"" and ""want an end"", and directly states ""trying to slash my wrists and die"". This clearly indicates a desire to die and suicidal intent.
    *   *Conclusion:* Not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent is present.
    *   The post mentions a specific **method**: ""slash my wrists"".
    *   The phrase ""on the verge of trying"" indicates a current, imminent intent to carry out this method. This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition requiring a specific method with suicidal intent.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The phrase ""I tried, I guess."" is not a description of a ""specific past concrete action"" of a suicide attempt. It's vague and does not detail what was done. Therefore, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die and suicidal thoughts (Step 2).
    *   It also includes a specific method (""slash my wrists"") and indicates being ""on the verge of trying"" to act on it (Step 3). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a specific method.
    *   The vague past reference does not meet the strict criteria for 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I cannot wait to die"", ""at least the pain will all be gone"", ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""my life is not able to be fixed"", ""pain will all be gone"", ""bullshit phase"". These indicate hopelessness and despair.
    - Specific plans: The phrase ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it"" indicates a clear sign of preparation for death, specifically getting affairs in order related to their impending death.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die: ""I cannot wait to die"".
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (""I cannot wait to die"").
    - The post mentions a clear sign of preparation: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it"". This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition's examples of ""preparations"" or ""getting my affairs in order"".

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I cannot wait to die"").
    - It also includes a clear sign of preparation for suicide/death (""ill fix all of the funeral costs""), which is a key element of the 'Behavior' definition.
    - There are no descriptions of past concrete actions, so it's not 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""what's really the point?"" in the context of profound despair about the future (""if life won't ever be as good again"") implies a questioning of the value of continued existence or a lack of purpose for living. It's an indirect expression of a desire for things to end or not to continue.
    - Emotional indicators: ""perfect happiness"" (past), ""everything that made my happiness has now left me,"" ""destined to live a depressed life,"" ""can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, and a belief that future happiness is impossible.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? The phrase ""what's really the point?"" when combined with the severe hopelessness (""if life won't ever be as good again,"" ""destined to live a depressed life"") is a strong existential questioning of the value of life, implying a desire for it to end or a lack of desire to continue living under such circumstances. This is stronger than general distress and aligns with the 'Ideation' definition's examples like ""I want it to be over"" or ""I wish I could disappear"" by expressing a lack of purpose for continued existence. It's a clear desire not to be alive in the current state or future state as perceived. Therefore, Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - If YES to any of these elements of planning, it strongly suggests 'Behavior'. Since none are present, it is not 'Behavior' based on planning.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire not to be alive (or a strong questioning of the point of continuing to live) due to profound hopelessness about the future (""what's really the point?"" combined with ""destined to live a depressed life""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There are no specific plans (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action to end their life, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes... a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""highest chance of death"" in the context of ""jump from a bridge"" directly indicates a desire to die by suicide. ""hopefully everything pans out the way I want"" implies a desire for the suicide attempt to be successful.
    - Emotional indicators: The user is clearly in distress, seeking information for a lethal act.

        - Preparations: ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend"" indicates an active step in planning.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""highest chance of death"" when discussing jumping from a bridge is an unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die. Therefore, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific **method**: Yes, ""jump from a bridge"".
        - Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: The bridge is the means for the jump.
        - A specific **location** being considered for suicide: Yes, ""NYC"" and asking ""which one"" (bridge).
        - A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide: Yes, ""by the weekend"".
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: Yes, ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend"".
    - Conclusion: Yes, multiple elements of a specific plan are present (method, location, timeframe, preparation). This strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post is entirely about current intent and future planning.
    - Conclusion: Not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die (""highest chance of death"" by jumping). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by including specific elements of a plan: a defined method (""jump from a bridge""), a specific timeframe (""by the weekend""), and actively seeking a specific location/means (""which one do I have the highest chance of death""). This rules out 'Ideation'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - All criteria for 'Behavior' are met.

I supposed to be an alien, I supposed to suffer. This is my place in the world. I am here to live in pain. I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny, right? Do I deserve it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post states, ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free."" This is a statement of feeling trapped in life and pain, not a desire to die or end life. It implies a lack of ability to die, rather than a wish for death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""My parents never understands me and they treat me like shit,"" ""I am trying, why wouldn't they ever understand?"", ""I just need someone in my life who would see that I am trying,"" ""this is not who I want to be,"" ""I supposed to be an alien, I supposed to suffer,"" ""This is my place in the world. I am here to live in pain,"" ""The pain will never loosen it's grip."" These indicate significant distress, feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, despair, and being misunderstood.
    - Specific plans: None.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrase ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free"" expresses the opposite – a feeling of being unable to escape life and its pain, not a desire to end life. It's a statement of perpetual suffering, not a wish for death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being trapped in pain.
    - However, it *lacks* any explicit mention of suicide or a clear, unambiguous desire to die. The statement ""I am convinced that I will never die"" indicates a feeling of being stuck in life and suffering, rather than a wish to end life.
    - Based on the definitions:
        - 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer."" This is not present.
        - 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are not applicable as there is no suicidal intent, plan, or past concrete action.
        - 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive... it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'."" This post fits the 'Indicator' definition perfectly as it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but *not* a clear desire to die.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The post explicitly mentions the sister ""willingly and voluntarily ended her life"" and ""had made attempts in the past"" (referring to the sister). Crucially, the poster states, ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work"". This is a clear description of a past concrete action by the poster. The poster also expresses a clear desire to cease existing: ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"" and ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from"" (referring to sleep).
    - Emotional indicators: ""can't shake the pain,"" ""so much doubt about myself,"" ""doesn't feel that far-fetched"" (referring to ending life), ""don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore,"" ""not particularly drawn one way or the other,"" ""look forward to sleep."" These indicate significant emotional distress, anhedonia, and a desire for an end to current feelings.
    - Specific plans: There are no specific plans (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations) for a *current* suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: Yes, ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" is a clear description of a past concrete action taken by the poster to end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" in reference to a past action by the poster (""aborted attempt at suicide"").
    - Yes, there are other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or cease existing: ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"" and ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.""
    - This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - While there is clear suicidal ideation/desire to die, the post *does not* mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for a *current* suicide. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' based on current planning.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life: ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work"". This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt' which requires a description of a ""specific past concrete action"".

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and mentions suicide, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific *current* plan, so it's not 'Behavior' based on current plans.
    - However, the post explicitly describes a ""specific past concrete action"" taken by the poster to end their life (""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago""). This directly fulfills the criteria for the 'Attempt' category. The definition for 'Attempt' explicitly states: ""The content describes one or more specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life... Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" In this case, there's a past concrete action and current ideation, which still leads to 'Attempt'.

I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""I can't continue this disappointment"" combined with ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" and ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best"" clearly indicates an intent to end their life. The ""less of a mess"" comment reinforces this.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""disappointment,"" ""nothing,"" ""no hope anymore,"" ""no joy anymore,"" ""no emotion anymore,"" ""pain in numb."" These show extreme despair, hopelessness, anhedonia, and emotional numbness.
    *   **Specific plans:** ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess."" This explicitly states a specific *location* (""in the tub"") and implies a *method* (whatever action would be taken in a tub to create ""less of a mess,"" e.g., cutting wrists, drowning, electrocution). The farewell message ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You."" serves as a clear sign of *preparation* (saying goodbyes).
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No mention of past concrete actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit use of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life.""
    *   However, there is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die/cease existing through the phrase ""I plan on doing it"" in the context of extreme distress and a farewell message. This constitutes a clear desire to die.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post mentions:
        *   A specific **location**: ""in the tub"".
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You."" (a farewell/goodbye).
    *   The mention of a specific location and preparation elements strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. It describes a current plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to end life (""I can't continue,"" ""I plan on doing it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   It contains a clear desire to die *and* specific elements of a plan: a specific location (""in the tub"") and signs of preparation (the farewell message). This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" These are direct expressions of suicidal ideation. The phrase ""when theyre gone.youre gone"" also implies their own demise. The poster describes taking painkillers/antidepressants secretly, which led to paracetamol addiction, liver/digestive damage, puking, and self-starvation. This is self-harming behavior, but the post frames it as ""to cope with those racing thoughts"" and ""led to my addiction,"" not as a direct attempt to end their life. The intent described is coping/addiction, not suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with indicators of severe distress, including hopelessness (""sick of being epileptic,"" ""melancholic mind,"" ""brain fog,"" ""inability to concentrate,"" ""living nightmare,"" ""traumatized,"" ""bullying trauma,"" ""deteriorated mental and physical health,"" ""no empathy,"" ""cried myself to sleep,"" ""negative voices,"" ""constant state of stress,"" ""mental breakdowns,"" ""trauma,"" ""strong feelings of abandonment,"" ""paralyzing fear of abandonment,"" ""crippling depressives reaction,"" ""suffocated me with my evil thoughts,"" ""miserably unfair,"" ""infuriating,"" ""absolute failure,"" ""lost every friend,"" ""failed miserably,"" ""inability to accept my ordeals,"" ""never deserved anything,"" ""sabotage the gifts"").
    *   **Specific plans:** There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., ""how"" they will end it), specific means (e.g., ""what"" they will use), a specific location, a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my birthday""), or any preparations (e.g., writing notes, saying goodbyes). The post states the *intent* to end it and the *reasons* for it, but not a plan.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide:** The self-harming behavior (painkiller addiction, starvation) is described as coping and addiction, not as a direct attempt to end life. The language used does not indicate suicidal intent for these actions; rather, it describes the negative consequences of coping mechanisms. Therefore, it does not meet the strict definition of 'Attempt' which requires a description of a concrete action taken *to try to end their life*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of wanting to ""end it"" (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT,"" ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it"").
    *   This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    *   However, the post does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide. It only states the desire and the reasons behind it.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post describes self-harm and addiction (misuse of painkillers, starvation) and their negative consequences (liver damage, puking). However, it frames these actions as coping mechanisms (""to cope with those racing thoughts"") and resulting addiction, not as concrete actions taken *to try to end their life*. The definition for 'Attempt' requires a description of what the person *did* to *try to end their life*. The post does not explicitly state this intent for the described actions.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to end one's life (""going to end it,"" ""wanting to end it""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) for suicide, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    *   While it describes self-harming behaviors and their severe consequences, the intent behind these actions, as described in the post, is coping/addiction, not a direct past attempt to end life. This differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but without a specific plan or a described past concrete attempt to end life.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""He was everything to me,"" ""I loved him so much,"" ""I have no one,"" ""I felt like crying,"" ""Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything."" (hopelessness, despair, anger, loss, worthlessness).
    *   **Specific plans:** ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" This is a specific method (being crushed by a train), means (train), and location (train station/tracks).
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""I feel like cutting myself again."" This implies past cutting behavior. However, it does not describe a *specific past concrete action* taken *to try to end their life*. It's an urge to repeat self-harm, not a detailed account of a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions: ""really want to fucking kill myself.""
    *   Yes, there are other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die: ""let a train crush my head.""
    *   Since there are explicit mentions and a clear desire to die, the post is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**: Yes, ""let a train crush my head.""
        *   Specific **means**: Yes, ""train.""
        *   A specific **location**: Yes, ""train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks.""
        *   A specific **timeframe**: No explicit timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but the language ""I'm thinking about running away to the train station"" suggests immediate contemplation of the act.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: No explicit preparation mentioned.
    *   Since there is a specific method, means, and location, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post states ""I feel like cutting myself again."" While this indicates past self-harm, it does not describe a *specific past concrete action* the poster took *to try to end their life*. The definition requires a description of *what they did* with suicidal intent. This phrase is an urge to repeat a past behavior, not a detailed account of a suicide attempt. Therefore, it does not meet the strict criteria for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die and mentions ""kill myself,"" so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It contains a very specific plan, including a method, means, and location (""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head""). This explicitly fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   While there's a mention of past self-harm (""cutting myself again""), it's not described as a past *suicide attempt* (a concrete action taken to try to end their life) according to the strict definition. The primary and most severe element is the current, detailed plan.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly describes a current desire to die with a specific plan (method, means, location).

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I have wanted to die,"" ""suicide attempts,"" ""kill myself,"" ""not allowed to die,"" ""lets me die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""jealous and pissed as fuck,"" ""mess,"" ""trash,"" ""depressed,"" ""medication resilient major depressive disorder,"" ""forced to live,"" ""24/7 intrusive thoughts."" This indicates severe distress, hopelessness, and a clear desire to die.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method, means, location, or timeframe for a *current* suicide plan is mentioned. The desire to die is present, but not a concrete plan for *how* or *when* to do it *now*.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""I had a few suicide attempts, i don't regret them, and the most successful attempt involved me being saved by someone who committed suicide a couple years back."" This is a clear description of past *concrete actions* (attempts) that the poster took, specifically mentioning being saved from one.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide attempts"" and ""kill myself,"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I have wanted to die,"" ""I should be able to kill myself,"" ""until the world lets me die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   While the post contains suicidal intent, it does *not* describe a specific *current* plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) for suicide. The desire for a ""thorazine drip"" is a hypothetical state of being, not a suicide plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post describes specific past concrete actions: ""I had a few suicide attempts, i don't regret them, and the most successful attempt involved me being saved..."" This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' which requires describing a ""specific past concrete action"" taken to try to end one's life. The phrase ""involved me being saved"" clearly indicates a past action that was an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal desire and mentions, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a *current* specific plan, so it's not 'Behavior' based on a *current* plan.
    *   However, it clearly describes past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide (""I had a few suicide attempts,"" ""the most successful attempt involved me being saved""). This fits the 'Attempt' definition precisely.

These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, worthlessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method:** ""this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of."" This describes characteristics of a method, implying a specific one is being considered, even if not named.

    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real."" ""I feel shame for failing."" ""anger of not being able to get over my own survival instincts."" ""I'm going to try again."" The phrase ""I'm going to try again"" directly implies a past attempt. ""Shame for failing"" and ""anger of not being able to get over my own survival instincts"" confirm that a past action was taken and it was a failed attempt. While the specific *type* of action (e.g., ""I took pills"") is not detailed, the fact that an attempt occurred is clear from ""try again"" and ""failing.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""Trying to kill myself"" and ""I'm going to try again,"" clearly expressing a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent is present.
    *   The post mentions a ""different method"" with specific characteristics (""much easier and not so easy to back out of""). This points towards a plan.
    *   However, the timeframe is highly uncertain (""tomorrow maybe... maybe next year"").
    *   If only considering the future plan, it has elements of 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post clearly describes a past attempt: ""I'm going to try again"" indicates a previous attempt. ""I feel shame for failing"" and ""anger of not being able to get over my own survival instincts"" explicitly state that a past action was taken to end their life, and it was unsuccessful. This meets the criteria for 'Attempt' as it describes a concrete past action, even if the specific method of that past action isn't detailed. The rule states: ""A concrete action (what the person *did*) must be described."" ""I'm going to try again"" and ""shame for failing"" describe that a concrete action was taken.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation and a desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It mentions a future plan (a ""different method""), which points towards 'Behavior'.
    *   Crucially, it also explicitly refers to a past concrete action to end their life (""I'm going to try again,"" ""shame for failing"").
    *   According to the definition of 'Attempt': ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""All I want is courage to end it."" This is a strong, direct expression of wanting to end one's life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Satanic Groundhog day,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No income,"" ""Nothing to do,"" ""Reminded every second of others successes,"" ""No bueno,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""No money will rot your brain,"" ""It's over."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and general distress.

    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: No past attempts are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? While ""end it"" is not ""kill myself,"" in this context (""All I want is courage to end it"" following expressions of extreme despair and ""It's over""), it is an unambiguous expression of wanting to end their life.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""It's over. All I want is courage to end it"" clearly expresses a desire to cease existing.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die/end life, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present):
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.
    - Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to end one's life (""All I want is courage to end it"") and states ""It's over,"" indicating a strong suicidal thought/desire.
    - However, it does not include any specific details of a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation).
    - It does not describe a past concrete action.

    - Suicidal intent is present (from step 2).
    - The post mentions a specific timeframe: ""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours. I'm going out... at that time."" This is a precise date and time for the planned act, which is a key criterion for 'Behavior' (""a specific timeframe for the act"").

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post describes a future action (""I'm going out"", ""I'm offing myself then""), not a specific past concrete action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

    *   Does the post describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post describes a long history of depression but no actual past attempt.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive (""I just want off this life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes... a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I need to kill myself"" and refers to ""me killing myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""completely failing school,"" ""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore,"" ""life just isn't worth it,"" ""terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends."" These indicate hopelessness, anhedonia, worthlessness, and distress.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or timeframe for the act itself. The age ""15"" is mentioned as the current age, not a planned age for suicide. The question ""how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends"" is a consideration about the impact of suicide, not a part of a concrete plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation).
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions: ""I need to kill myself,"" and ""me killing myself."" It also expresses a clear desire to die: ""life just isn't worth it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method? No.
    - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
    - A specific location? No.
    - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No. (The age 15 is current, not a future timeframe for the act).
    - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there are no elements of a specific plan as defined, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I need to kill myself"") and a clear desire to not be alive (""life just isn't worth it""). This means it is more than 'Indicator'.
    - It does NOT contain any specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations), which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - It does NOT describe a past concrete action, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

It's a cycle that I can't escape.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'll be gone"" (implies ceasing to exist/dying), ""My own body has given up on itself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""no possible way to turn my life around anymore,"" ""no point in trying anymore,"" ""so tired of fighting this constantly,"" ""constantly stuck living the old ones,"" ""cycle that I can't escape."" (Hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, feeling trapped).
    - Specific plans: ""By this time next week I'll be gone."" This is a specific timeframe.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" in the context of extreme hopelessness (""no point in trying anymore,"" ""tired of fighting"") is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to cease existing/die.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die/cease existing, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No.
        - Specific means: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide: YES, ""By this time next week"". This is a clear and specific timeframe.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - Since a specific timeframe is present, it strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to cease existing (""I'll be gone"") which points to suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a specific timeframe (""By this time next week"") for this act. According to the 'Behavior' definition, a plan MUST include one or more of: method, means, timeframe, tools/weapons, or locations. The presence of a specific timeframe meets this criterion.
    - There are no descriptions of past concrete actions, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of a specific timeframe elevates it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.

267,I hope I don't make it. I don't want to survive another attempt because all my parents will tell me is how expensive the medical bill is. I just want to die without having to hear them again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I hope I don't make it,"" ""I don't want to survive another attempt,"" ""I just want to die."" The phrase ""another attempt"" is a strong indicator of past self-harm/suicidal action.
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, frustration (with parents' reaction).
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or timeframe for a *future* suicide act is mentioned. The post expresses a desire regarding the *outcome* of a potential future event (""I hope I don't make it"") and a past event (""another attempt"").
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: The phrase ""another attempt"" directly refers to a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Explicit mentions: No direct use of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - Other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die: Yes, ""I hope I don't make it,"" ""I don't want to survive another attempt,"" ""I just want to die."" This clearly indicates a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a desire to die, but it does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation for a *future* suicide act. It refers to a *past* attempt and a desire for a specific outcome if another attempt were to occur.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action. The phrase ""I don't want to survive *another attempt*"" explicitly indicates that a previous, concrete action to end their life has occurred. The word ""attempt"" in this context refers to a concrete action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (Step 2), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - While there's a desire to die, there is no specific plan for a *future* act mentioned (Step 3), so it's not 'Behavior' based on a new plan.
    - The crucial element is the clear reference to a ""past concrete action"" through the phrase ""another attempt"" (Step 4). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes one or more specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life.""

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly uses ""suicide attempt,"" ""vaguely suicidal stuff,"" and ""intention of dying."" It also refers to ""point of no return"" in the context of these actions.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""struggle to not think about,"" ""genuinely bothered me afterwards,"" ""struggle to categorize,"" ""weighing on me,"" ""bothering me.""
    *   **Specific plans:** No current specific plans (method, means, location, timeframe, preparations) are mentioned. The post explicitly states, ""Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now.""
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:**
        *   ""The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped."" This describes a past concrete action (""went until shortly before the point of no return"") even if the intent was ""testing"" and it was stopped.
        *   ""The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself."" This clearly describes a past concrete action (""went in"") with the explicit ""intention of dying,"" which was then stopped. The act of ""going in with the intention of dying"" is a concrete action taken towards ending one's life, even if aborted.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide attempt"" and ""intention of dying"" in the context of past events.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post discusses past events and explicitly states the poster is in a ""tenuously better situation right now"" and feels ""somewhat separated from them."" There is no mention of a *current* plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparations). Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post describes two past events where the poster took concrete actions with suicidal intent or to test a method.
    *   The second event, ""I went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself,"" clearly describes a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life. Even though the poster stopped themselves, the action was initiated with the intention to die. This fits the definition of 'Attempt' which focuses on ""specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a clear past desire to die, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   It describes past concrete actions taken with suicidal intent (""went in with the intention of dying"" and then ""stopped myself""), which directly aligns with the 'Attempt' definition of describing ""specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life.""
    *   It does not describe a *current* plan, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires to die by describing specific actions taken in the past, so it is not 'Ideation'.
    *   Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I really want to die"" and ""Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone."" It also includes rhetorical questions like ""So what do I have to live for?"" which imply a lack of will to live. There is a phrase ""I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions,"" which, while not directly suicidal, points to a desire for cessation of feeling.
    - Emotional indicators: Strong indicators of hopelessness (""Why exactly should I even have hope anymore?"", ""nothing ever gets better"", ""I will never achieve my goals""), despair, worthlessness (""I probably deserve to suffer"", ""I am the one ruining my own life""), and deep dissatisfaction with life.
    - Specific plans: There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping), means (e.g., pills, rope), location (e.g., bridge, building), specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or preparations (e.g., writing notes, giving away things). The phrase ""Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself"" refers to harming others, not self-harm or suicide.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: The post describes past experiences of being bullied and bullying others, but it does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I really want to die"" and ""Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone"" are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die expressed, the post is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations? No. The post expresses a strong desire to die but does not outline any specific plan or steps to carry it out.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. While the post details past trauma and negative experiences, it does not describe any past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to cut myself"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I really want to die,"" ""I'd rather die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depression ruined a great life"", ""fucking hell"", ""destroys any hope"", ""never ending pit"", ""terrible teachers"", ""nightmare"".
    *   **Specific plans:** The post mentions ""jump in front of a car"" or ""stab myself"" as potential methods, and ""looking up how to do it"" as research. However, the crucial phrase ""I wish I had the courage to..."" indicates a *lack* of immediate intent or an active plan to carry out these methods. It expresses a desire for the courage to act, not a current plan to act.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past concrete actions are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""contemplating suicide"" and a clear desire to die (""I wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself so this nightmare could all be over""). This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post mentions methods (""jump in front of a car"", ""stab myself"") and research (""looking up how to do it""). However, the phrase ""I wish I had the courage to..."" explicitly states a *lack* of the courage needed to execute such a plan. This indicates that while methods are being considered or desired, there isn't a firm, actionable plan in place. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a *plan* to commit suicide, which implies intent to act. The ""wish"" suggests a barrier to action, placing it outside the realm of an active plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there are explicit suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.
    *   Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': While methods are mentioned and research has been done (""looking up how to do it""), the explicit statement ""I wish I had the courage to..."" indicates that there is no current, actionable plan. The poster desires to act but lacks the courage to do so. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide""). The mention of methods is part of the ideation process, but the lack of courage prevents it from being classified as a concrete plan for 'Behavior'.

    *   Yes, the post mentions a specific **method** and **means**: ""pull the trigger"" clearly indicates using a gun to end one's life. This fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post describes a future intention (""I'm just going to pull the trigger"") not a past concrete action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It also includes a specific method/means (""pull the trigger"") for carrying out suicide. This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification as it includes both suicidal intent and a specific plan/method.

And at work my forearms with my wounds are visible for everyone to notice but they just say thinks like work faster, go to bed earlier( sleeping is really hard and I'm tired all the time). I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness. Death seems like the only place where I can be free.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I hurt myself two months ago,"" ""my forearms with my wounds are visible"" (direct self-harm). ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" (indirect language about death as an escape).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""tired of putting a mask on for others happiness,"" ""I'm tired all the time,"" ""couldn't hide my pain,"" ""It's like she doesn't care for my Problems."" (feelings of neglect, exhaustion, hopelessness, despair).
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide:** ""I hurt myself two months ago"" describes a concrete action of self-harm. The post does not explicitly state that the intent of this self-harm was to end their life (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself by hurting myself"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to cease existing to escape suffering.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die, the post is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide? No. There is no mention of how, when, or where they plan to act, nor any preparations.
    *   Therefore, the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? The post states, ""I hurt myself two months ago."" This is a specific past concrete action. However, the definition of 'Attempt' requires the action to be taken ""to try to end their life."" The post describes the action (""hurt myself"") and its visibility (""my forearms with my wounds are visible"") but does not explicitly state that the *intent* of this self-harm was to end their life. While self-harm can be a suicide attempt, it can also be non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Without explicit lethal intent stated or strongly implied for the past action, it does not strictly meet the 'Attempt' definition. The examples given for 'Attempt' (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists"") imply lethal intent more directly than ""I hurt myself.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not 'Indicator' because it expresses a clear desire for death (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").
    *   The post is not 'Behavior' because, while there is a desire for death, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations) mentioned for current suicidal action.
    *   The post is not 'Attempt' because, although it mentions a past concrete action of self-harm (""I hurt myself""), it does not explicitly state or strongly imply that this action was taken ""to try to end their life."" The intent of the past self-harm is ambiguous regarding lethality.
    *   The phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" directly fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

275,"More than anything I want help and to get better, but I can't tell anyone. I just moved out of home, I live on campus now. I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much. At the same time, this is so much to carry alone, it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone. It's too much. I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""the more suicidal I get"", ""I write detailed plans in my journal"", ""long conversations with myself about suicide"", ""I think about suicide every day"", ""actually seriously consider it"", ""make me twice as suicidal"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""alone"", ""sad all the time"", ""too much to carry alone"".
    *   **Specific plans:** The post explicitly states, ""I write detailed plans in my journal"". This is a key element. It also mentions having ""long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal"" and ""actually seriously consider it only once a week or so.""
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No specific past concrete actions are described. The phrase ""it's been like this for seven years"" refers to the duration of the feelings, not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" multiple times, and the phrase ""I think about suicide every day"" clearly indicates a desire or contemplation of ending one's life.
    *   Since there are explicit mentions of suicide and a clear desire to die/consideration of suicide, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post states, ""I write detailed plans in my journal"". The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent (e.g., 'I've written a suicide note')"" and ""preparations"". Writing *detailed plans* in a journal constitutes a form of preparation and documentation of a plan, which goes beyond mere ideation. Even if the plans are not explicitly described in the post itself, the *act* of writing detailed plans is a concrete step towards planning. The statement ""I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did"" indicates a conflict, but the *existence* of detailed plans is still present.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No. The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and consideration (""the more suicidal I get,"" ""I think about suicide every day""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a specific past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The presence of ""detailed plans in my journal"" is the critical factor. This moves the classification beyond 'Ideation' (which is thoughts/desire *without* a specific plan) into 'Behavior'. Writing detailed plans is a form of preparation and a concrete step in developing a suicide plan, even if the plans themselves aren't fully disclosed in the post or if the individual expresses hesitation about acting on them. The definition of 'Behavior' specifically includes ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent (e.g., 'I've written a suicide note')"" and preparations, which ""writing detailed plans"" aligns with.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I can't take it anymore"" (feeling overwhelmed, distress), ""The pain is unreal"" (severe emotional/mental suffering).
    *   **Specific plans:** None.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrases ""I can't take it anymore"" and ""The pain is unreal"" express severe distress and a feeling of being overwhelmed by suffering, but they do not explicitly state a desire to die or not be alive. They are general expressions of extreme emotional pain. The definition for 'Ideation' requires a *clear desire to not be alive* (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wouldn't wake up""), which is not present here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Not applicable, as there is no clear suicidal intent or desire to die expressed in step 2.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress and pain (""I can't take it anymore,"" ""The pain is unreal"").
    *   It does *not* contain explicit suicidal language or a clear, unambiguous desire to die or not be alive.
    *   This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., 'life sucks,' 'I'm so unhappy,' 'I feel worthless,' 'I'm struggling')."" The phrases fit ""general expressions of distress.""
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit desire to die or end one's life.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Indicator'.

277,"Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post directly states ""committing suicide.""
    - Emotional indicators: The phrase ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action"" indicates a dark, possibly sarcastic, and deeply distressed mindset, twisting a concept of recovery (AA, Higher Power) into a means for self-destruction. This suggests severe hopelessness and suicidal intent.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The post states capability, not a plan of action.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: There is no description of a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""commiting suicide."" This confirms it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal intent but does not mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations. It only states the *capability* to commit suicide, not a concrete plan. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life. It discusses a current feeling of capability, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit mention of ""suicide"" and a clear expression of suicidal thoughts/desire (""I think I'm capable of committing suicide sober""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, which distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it best fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings or a clear desire to not be alive, without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No direct mentions of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""drunk because I'm a piece of shit,"" ""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I don't want to be alone any more,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" ""I just want it to be over,"" ""I'm sick and tired and I wasn't to be down."" These indicate severe distress, self-loathing, hopelessness, and a desire for their current state to end.
    - Specific plans: No mention of method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. The phrases ""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" and ""I just want it to be over"" strongly convey a clear desire to cease existing or end their life/suffering. ""I wasn't to be down"" appears to be a typo, likely meaning ""I want to be done"" or ""I want to lie down/be dead"" in the context of wanting it all to be over. This is a clear desire to not be alive anymore.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No.
        - Specific means: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: No.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - Therefore, there is no explicit plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, there is a clear desire to not be alive (""I just want it to be over,"" ""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I hate every part of my life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 3, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it contains a clear desire to not be alive any longer (""I just want it to be over"") but without any specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""attempted suicide 11 times"", ""my suicide"".
    - Emotional indicators: The post expresses a strong, disturbing intent (""existential terrorist,"" ""use my suicide to disturb people for my own satisfaction,"" ""I hate capitalism"").
    - Specific plans: The phrase ""I will use my suicide"" indicates a future intent, but it does not specify a method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation. It's about the purpose of the act, not the how/when.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" This is a direct and concrete statement of past actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" and ""attempted suicide."" It also clearly expresses a future intent to commit suicide (""I will use my suicide"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - While there is a clear future intent (""I will use my suicide""), there is no specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation mentioned. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' based on a specific plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post explicitly states: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" This is a clear description of specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - The rule states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" The statement ""I will use my suicide"" can be considered a mention of current intent or a general future ""plan"" (though not detailed enough for 'Behavior'). Given the explicit description of past attempts, 'Attempt' is the primary classification.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The most definitive statement in the post is ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" This directly fulfills the definition of 'Attempt' which requires ""specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life.""
    - Even though there's a mention of future intent (""I will use my suicide""), the explicit description of past attempts takes precedence according to the 'Attempt' definition's specific note.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" ""I just want the pain to end.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Welcome to the bottom of hell,"" ""bad break up that really messed me up,"" ""Fell into depression,"" ""flunked college,"" ""fired,"" ""feel more lonely,"" ""no real friends anymore,"" ""most fucked up thing,"" ""given up completely,"" ""I don't recognise myself any more.""

    - Specific plans: No current specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) is mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This is a clear, concrete description of past actions.

    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" in the context of past actions.
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die/cease existing: ""I just want the pain to end.""
    - Since there are explicit mentions and a clear desire to die, it's more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - There is no mention of a *current* specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide. The statement ""I just want the pain to end"" expresses a desire, but not a plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post describes specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This is a direct statement of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation (""I just want the pain to end,"" ""I've just given up completely"").
    - Most importantly, it explicitly states a history of concrete suicide attempts: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now.""
    - According to the definitions, 'Attempt' is for content that ""describes one or more specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life."" This fits perfectly. Even though there's no *current* plan described (which would be 'Behavior'), the presence of described past attempts takes precedence and classifies it as 'Attempt'.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death."" - Direct mention of self-inflicted death.

        *   ""for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth."" - Discusses a specific method (handgun), means (caliber), and location (mouth/palate).
        *   ""I've looked into other options"" - Implies research into methods.
        *   ""Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed"" - Discusses a specific method (overdosing) and negative outcomes of a failed attempt.
        *   ""A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate."" - Explicitly uses the term ""suicide"" and expresses fear of failed attempts.

    *   **Specific plans:** The post details specific methods (""shotgun,"" ""handguns,"" ""overdosing""), specific means (caliber of handgun), and a specific location for one method (""through my upper palate in my mouth""). There is no explicit timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") or preparation (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means).
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past concrete actions taken by the poster are described. The mention of Mark Linkous is about someone else.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""how to accomplish death,"" ""suicide,"" and detailed discussions of methods for self-inflicted death (shotgun, handgun, overdose). This clearly indicates a desire to die or end one's life. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post mentions:
        *   A specific **method**: Yes (""shotgun,"" ""handguns,"" ""overdosing"").
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: No explicit acquisition, but detailed discussion of ""small caliber or large caliber"" for handguns implies consideration of means.
        *   A specific **location** being considered for suicide: Yes (""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth"").
        *   A specific **timeframe**: No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: No.
    *   Despite the expressed fear (""terribly scared of how to accomplish death""), the detailed discussion of specific methods, means, and a specific location for suicide constitutes a ""plan"" as defined for 'Behavior'. The poster is actively contemplating and evaluating *how* to end their life.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. The reference to Mark Linkous is about someone else.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not 'Indicator' because it contains explicit suicidal ideation and a clear desire to die.
    *   The post is not 'Attempt' because it does not describe any past concrete actions taken by the poster to end their life.
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die. Crucially, it also includes specific elements of a plan: specific methods (shotgun, handgun, overdose), specific means (caliber of handgun), and a specific location (shooting through the mouth/palate). This detailed discussion of *how* to commit suicide, even if accompanied by fear or uncertainty about execution, fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it goes beyond mere thoughts and into the contemplation of concrete actions and their specifics.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is an indirect but clear expression of wanting to cease existing or die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Can't do any of it!"" shows hopelessness/despair. ""Just don't want this anymore"" indicates extreme dissatisfaction with life.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life.""
    - However, ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die or cease existing. This clearly indicates a desire to not be alive. (Yes)

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):

    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a specific past concrete action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the definitions, the post fits 'Ideation' perfectly as it expresses a clear desire to not be alive any longer (similar to ""I wish I wouldn't wake up"") but without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die"" is explicitly stated twice.
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""tired of everything,"" ""tired of pretending,"" ""tired of lying,"" ""tied of being scared,"" ""What's the point."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and exhaustion.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I want to die"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: No.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - There are no elements of a plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die (""I want to die""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe any specific past concrete actions of attempting suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, based on the clear desire to die without a specific plan, the post best fits the 'Ideation' category.

    - It mentions a specific timeframe (""It must be a Tuesday to run away"").
    - The presence of a clear desire to die *and* multiple elements of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe) strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. It focuses on current thoughts and a current plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out? I want to be done, I want to be out of this and I wish I could just sleep for now but I can't. I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore. Sorry for the total drivel, I'm so angry/down right now and I needed to vent.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        - ""make me want to die"" (direct expression of wanting to die)
        - ""I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now"" (indifference to self-preservation)
        - ""I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over."" (expresses a desire for cessation of suffering, implying death)
        - ""I don't want to be here"" (clear desire not to be alive)
        - ""makes me want to not exist"" (clear desire to cease existing)
        - ""I want to be done, I want to be out of this"" (desire for cessation)
        - ""I want to disappear."" (clear desire not to be alive)
        - ""I do not want to exist anymore."" (clear desire to cease existing)
    - Emotional indicators: angry, upset, done with the world, crying, guilty, pissed, struggling, no one else, done, migraine (making feelings worse), down, can't see a solution or a way out (hopelessness).
    - Specific plans: No mention of a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide. The phrase ""fight the urge to go wandering off into the night"" is vague and does not specify a suicidal intent or a plan for suicide; it's an urge to leave combined with indifference to what happens, not a suicidal plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post does not use explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - However, it contains multiple direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: ""make me want to die,"" ""I don't want to be here,"" ""makes me want to not exist,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I do not want to exist anymore,"" and ""I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over.""
    - Given these clear expressions of a desire to die/not exist, the post is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die/not exist (from step 2).
    - Does it mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide? No. There is no mention of pills, weapons, specific places to jump from, a date/time for the act, or actions like writing a note or giving things away. The ""wandering off into the night"" is not a specific plan for suicide.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There are no descriptions of ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists,"" etc.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on step 2, there is a clear desire to die/not exist, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - Based on step 3, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation), ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - Based on step 4, there is no description of a past concrete suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': it includes clear expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer (""make me want to die,"" ""I don't want to be here,"" ""I want to not exist,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I do not want to exist anymore"") without any specific plan to commit suicide.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""ideations of suicide"" (direct), ""battling to stay alive"" (indirect but strong), ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive"" (direct desire to die), ""people/the world would be better off without me"" (implies desire to die).
    - Emotional indicators: ""tired of everything,"" ""tough,"" ""severely depressed,"" ""shitty person,"" ""shame,"" ""emotionally unstable,"" ""anxious,"" ""alone,"" ""painful,"" ""impossible,"" ""drag."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and anhedonia (lack of appetite, fucked sleep, difficulty leaving bed).
    - Specific plans: No mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation. The user explicitly states they don't tell their therapist about ""my ideations"" and fears reporting, which suggests these are thoughts without a concrete, actionable plan being formed or shared.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""ideations of suicide"" and ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive."" This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - No, the post does not mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide. It speaks of ""ideations"" (thoughts) rather than a plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""ideations of suicide"") and a strong desire to not be alive (""Most days I wish I wasn't alive""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thinking about killing myself"" (direct language).
    - Emotional indicators: ""so lonely,"" ""painful,"" ""can't take this anymore,"" ""What the fuck is wrong with me?"" (despair, hopelessness, severe distress).
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or timeframe for suicide is mentioned. ""I'm 22"" refers to current age, not a future date for an act. No preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains the explicit phrase ""thinking about killing myself.""
    - This clearly indicates suicidal intent/desire to die. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""thinking about killing myself"") and distress (""I can't take this anymore"").
    - However, it does NOT mention:
        - A specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump"").
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed.
        - A specific location.
        - A specific timeframe for the act (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my birthday""). The mention of ""22"" is about current age and loneliness, not a plan.
        - Clear signs of preparation.
    - Since there is no explicit plan, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It focuses on current thoughts and feelings. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""thinking about killing myself"") and a clear desire for the situation to end (""I can't take this anymore"").
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned.
    - There is no description of a past concrete suicide attempt.
    - Based on the definitions, this perfectly aligns with 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like 'suicide,' 'kill myself') OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The user expresses a desire for ""the constant anxiety and sadness... to stop by crashing into another car,"" which is a clear, albeit indirect, desire to die. They also state ""afraid that I won't die on impact,"" further confirming the intent to die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""constant anxiety and sadness,"" ""pointless situation.""
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""crashing into another car.""
        - Means: The car itself.
        - Location: Implied ""highway speed"" suggests a highway.
        - Timeframe: None specified.
        - Preparations: ""frequently come close to doing it"" indicates recurring contemplation and proximity to acting on the plan, but not a concrete preparation like writing a note.
    - Past concrete actions: The post explicitly states ""never can because I'm afraid that I won't die on impact,"" indicating no past concrete action was taken.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - Yes, there is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die: ""I want the constant anxiety and sadness... to stop by crashing into another car"" and ""afraid that I won't die on impact.""
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - Does the post mention:
        - A specific **method**: Yes, ""crashing into another car.""
        - Specific **means**: Yes, the car.
        - A specific **location**: Implied by ""highway speed"" and the context of crashing a car, a highway.
        - A specific **timeframe**: No.
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: ""frequently come close to doing it"" suggests active consideration and near-execution of the plan.
    - Since a specific method and implied location are mentioned, and the phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" indicates active engagement with this plan, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post explicitly states ""never can because I'm afraid that I won't die on impact,"" which confirms no past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's a clear desire to die.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described; in fact, the post states they haven't done it.
    - It falls between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. 'Behavior' includes suicidal thoughts *with* a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations). The post clearly describes a specific method (""crashing into another car"") and an implied location (""highway""). The phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" indicates an active, recurring consideration and near-execution of this specific plan. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""empty loneliness,"" ""tired of this,"" ""abuse me too."" (Despair, hopelessness, feeling overwhelmed).
    - Specific plans: The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" indicates intent but does not provide a specific method, means, location, or a concrete, definite timeframe (like ""tonight"" or ""on my birthday""). It's a vague future intent.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""I'm going to kill myself."" This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent is present (""I'm going to kill myself"").
    - Does the post mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" is not a *specific* timeframe as defined (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my 21st birthday""). It indicates an indefinite future.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since none of the specific elements of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, preparation) are present, it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""I'm going to kill myself,"" which is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to die.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - It does not contain any specific plan elements (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations) required for 'Behavior'. The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" is too vague to be considered a ""specific timeframe"" for the 'Behavior' definition.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Death is an option"", ""suicidal thought"", ""die (not suffering)"".
    - Emotional indicators: The post is more reflective and questioning than overtly emotional, but it expresses a personal consideration of death as an acceptable outcome.
    - Specific plans: No specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparations) is mentioned. The post explicitly states, ""I won't commit"".
    - Past concrete actions: No clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post explicitly uses the term ""suicidal thought"" and asks if ""Death is an option"" is considered as such. This is a direct engagement with the concept of suicide and a personal reflection on it being an ""option.""
    - While the poster states ""I won't commit,"" the core of the post is about whether the *thought* of death as an option constitutes suicidal thought. This indicates the presence of such thoughts. The statement ""It's not the worst outcome"" regarding dying in an accident also suggests a passive acceptance or even desire for non-existence, which aligns with 'Ideation's' broader definition of a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - There is no mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide. The post explicitly denies intent to commit (""I won't commit""). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It is not 'Indicator' because it explicitly discusses ""suicidal thought"" and ""Death is an option,"" which goes beyond general distress and directly engages with the concept of suicide as a personal consideration. The definition of 'Indicator' states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life."" This post contains explicit expression concerning suicide.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations). The poster explicitly states ""I won't commit.""
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as no past concrete action is described.
    - The post fits 'Ideation' because it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (by discussing ""suicidal thought"" and ""Death is an option"" as a personal consideration) and a passive acceptance of death (""It's not the worst outcome"") without any specific plan. The question about whether ""thinking death is an option"" is suicidal thought directly indicates the presence of such thoughts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""finally kill me"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent. ""planned this"" refers to a suicide plan.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I wish i didnt have to do this"" indicates distress and possibly ambivalence.
    - Specific plans:
        - Timeframe: ""Tonight is the last chance"" - a very specific and imminent timeframe. ""Its been a year since i planned this"" indicates long-term planning.
        - Preparations: ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"" - clear indication of preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""finally kill me"" and a clear desire to die (""Tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me""). This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2, suicidal intent is present.
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is named.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"" strongly implies means/preparations.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? YES: ""Tonight is the last chance"".
        - Clear signs of preparation? YES: ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"".
    - Since there is a specific timeframe (""Tonight"") and clear signs of preparation (""have the stuff prepared""), this strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. It mentions planning for a year, but not a past *action* or *attempt*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states a desire to ""kill me"" and refers to a suicide plan. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a specific timeframe (""Tonight"") and mentions preparations (""have the stuff prepared and everything""). These elements constitute a plan as defined for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""stave myself"", ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""Idk"", ""I hate my body"", ""I see no reason to fuel it with energy"". This indicates hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair.
    - Specific plans: ""I've decided to stop eating all together and stave myself"". This is a specific method.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""kill myself"" (even if immediately followed by a perceived inability to do so, it still expresses the thought) and a clear desire to die/cease existing: ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"".
    - Since there is explicit mention and a clear desire to die, it is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method? Yes, ""I've decided to stop eating all together and stave myself"". Starvation is a specific method being chosen to achieve the desired end (""this just ends"").
    - Does it mention specific means? The body itself is the means through starvation.
    - Does it mention a specific location? No.
    - Does it mention a specific timeframe? Not a precise time, but ""all together"" implies a continuous action until the desired outcome.
    - Clear signs of preparation? ""I've decided to stop eating all together"" indicates a decision and intent to act on this specific method.
    - The presence of a specific method (""stave myself"" by ""stop eating all together"") with the intent to end life (""this just ends"") strongly points to 'Behavior'. The initial statement ""I'm to much of a pussy to kill myself"" is immediately superseded by a *different* decided method of self-destruction.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It describes a current decision/plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") and a clear desire to die (""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It also contains a specific plan/method: ""I've decided to stop eating all together and stave myself"". This specific method, chosen with the intent to end life, fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

293,"Here's the deal. I'm not ok. I haven't been ok for a very long time. Some days are better than others, but for the most part, my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart with a center warm to the touch. In my past I've had everything that made me who I am stripped away from my character time and time again. It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do. Life on this planet is never easy, and there will always be people who've had it worse than me and made it out alive. But for now, in this moment as I write this, all I feel is that somber loneliness I've come to befriend over the last few months, but I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" implies that sometimes the user *does* wish to be gone, which is an indirect expression related to ceasing to exist. No direct mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""self-harm.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""not ok,"" ""cold, broken heart,"" ""dragged my face through the muds of life,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and sadness.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of past *concrete actions* taken to attempt suicide. The references to ""past"" experiences are about emotional stripping away and difficult life events, not suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life.""
    *   The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is a nuanced expression. It directly implies that there are times when the user *does* wish to be gone, which is a form of wanting to cease existing or not be alive. While not as direct as ""I want to die,"" it conveys a fluctuating desire to not be alive, especially when combined with the deep distress described (""cold, broken heart,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness""). This subtle but present desire to ""be gone"" moves it beyond mere general distress.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on the presence of a desire to ""be gone,"" I now check for a plan.
    *   There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means (e.g., ""bought a rope,"" ""have the gun""), a specific location (e.g., ""that bridge""), a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my birthday""), or clear preparations (e.g., ""writing notes,"" ""giving away things"").

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. References to past difficulties (""dragged my face through the muds of life,"" ""worst things to ever appear on our planet"") describe life experiences, not suicide attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a nuanced expression of a desire to ""be gone"" (""I don't always wish to be gone"" implies that sometimes they *do* wish to be gone), combined with profound emotional distress. This is more than general unhappiness and indicates a desire to not be alive, thus moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a specific past concrete action to attempt suicide, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses a desire to not be alive (even if intermittent) without detailing a specific plan.

I want a restart :/",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""suicidal"" and refers to ""my death"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""permanently fucked up this life"", ""destroyed myself"", ""depressed constantly"", ""lonely"", ""barely have the strength"", ""hurting to delay the pain my death will cause"", ""pathetic"", ""wish I wasn't so broken"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and self-worth issues.
    - Specific plans: There are no mentions of specific methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: There are no clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. ""destroyed myself"" is a feeling/state, not a described action of an attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, it explicitly uses the word ""suicidal"".
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?"" and ""I want a restart :/"" in the context of being suicidal and depressed, imply a desire to end current existence.

    Since there is an explicit mention of ""suicidal,"" it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There are no elements of a specific plan present. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. ""destroyed myself"" is a description of a state or feeling, not a concrete action of an attempt.

    Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""suicidal"") and a desire to not continue living (""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?""). This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition.
    - It lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe any specific past concrete actions of an attempt, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - It clearly expresses suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - Based on the definitions, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

295,"Work is killing me but I can't quit. Suicide becoming more enticing. Tl;Dr: Working retail has destroyed my body but can't stop working or family will lift a fuss. Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life,"" and ""whether it would be best to end myself."" It also uses phrases like ""probably best I head out before it gets worse"" in the context of these thoughts.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling trapped, worthlessness are evident (""Work is killing me but I can't quit,"" ""Nothing is happening in my life,"" ""My body is destroyed constantly,"" ""It's pathetic,"" ""I just feel stagnant,"" ""If nothing changes, the fuck am I getting up in the morning for?"").
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: No specific method is mentioned.
        - Means: No specific means are mentioned.
        - Location: No specific location is mentioned.
        - Timeframe: The post explicitly states, ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life,"" indicating *no* specific timeframe.
        - Preparations: No preparations are mentioned (e.g., writing notes, giving away things).
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""take my own life,"" and ""end myself."" It also expresses a clear desire to cease existing if circumstances don't change.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation? No. The post explicitly states ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life,"" which means there is no specific timeframe identified. There are no other elements of a plan. Therefore, it does not suggest 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There are no descriptions of past actions like ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to cut,"" etc.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on step 2, the post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a clear desire to die, so it is more than 'Indicator'.
    - Based on step 3, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations) mentioned. The explicit statement ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life"" confirms the absence of a specific timeframe. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    - Based on step 4, there is no description of a specific past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life without a specific plan, which aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just slit my wrists,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" ""my death,"" ""if you are seeing this then its already too late,"" ""I wont have much time to live,"" ""Goodbye.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I am not a good person,"" ""I just want to get it over with.""
    - Specific plans: The post describes the *method* (""slit my wrists,"" ""Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines""), *means* (""my dremel and saw attachment""), *preparations* (""I looked at many different pictures and graphs of where the radial artery is. i marked where the my artery should be""), and *timeframe* (""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it,"" ""if you are seeing this then its already too late,"" ""I wont have much time to live"").
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""I just slit my wrists."" This is a direct statement of a completed action. ""Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines."" This also describes a concrete action that has occurred. The phrase ""will post it once i have done it"" explicitly states the posting occurs *after* the action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No direct use of these exact phrases, but the context and actions described (""slit my wrists,"" ""my death,"" ""I wont have much time to live"") clearly indicate suicidal intent.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes (""my death will only benefit people,"" ""I just want to get it over with,"" ""if you are seeing this then its already too late,"" ""I wont have much time to live"").
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is clear desire to die. Proceed to analyze for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: Yes, ""slit my wrists,"" ""Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines.""
        - Specific means: Yes, ""my dremel and saw attachment.""
        - A specific location: Implied (wrists).
        - A specific timeframe: Yes, ""once i have done it,"" ""if you are seeing this then its already too late,"" implying the action has just occurred or is occurring.
        - Clear signs of preparation: Yes, ""I looked at many different pictures and graphs of where the radial artery is. i marked where the my artery should be.""
    - Conclusion: Yes, all elements of a plan are present. This would typically indicate 'Behavior'. However, the key is whether the action is *planned* or *already taken*.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life?
    - Yes, ""I just slit my wrists"" is a clear description of a concrete action that has just occurred. The statement ""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it"" confirms the post is made *after* the action. ""Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines"" further describes the concrete action taken.
    - This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life...""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die and describes a method and preparation, which aligns with 'Behavior'. However, the defining characteristic that supersedes 'Behavior' in this case is the explicit description of a *completed* concrete action. The phrases ""I just slit my wrists"" and ""Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines"" are past tense and describe an action that has already happened. The note about posting *after* the action further confirms this.
    - According to the 'Attempt' definition: ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life... Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" While it describes the immediate past, it is still a concrete action taken.

I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: The poster expresses internal conflict, feeling ""wrong"" and finding it ""hard to keep that from him,"" indicating distress and a personal struggle with their own suicidal thoughts.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide are mentioned by the poster for themselves.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide are described by the poster for themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself,"" which are direct expressions of wanting to die/not be alive.
    - This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post does not mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for carrying out suicide. It only expresses the state of being suicidal and a desire not to continue living.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself,"" which are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive. This fits the 'Ideation' definition.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action of attempting suicide, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Since there is clear suicidal ideation, it is not 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: Blame, anger, feeling wronged (""It's other people's fault,"" ""It's everyone else's fault,"" ""It's not my fault. Everything is thier fault.""). There's a conditional statement (""If I become worse... or kill myself"").
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The statement is conditional and general.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""kill myself.""
    - This means it is beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post mentions ""kill myself"" but does not include any specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means (e.g., ""bought a rope,"" ""have the gun""), specific location (e.g., ""the bridge""), specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my birthday""), or clear signs of preparation (e.g., ""writing note,"" ""giving things away""). The statement is conditional (""If I become worse... or kill myself"") and lacks the concrete details required for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It refers to a potential future action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which means it expresses suicidal thoughts/desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not contain any specific plan elements (method, means, location, specific timeframe, preparation), ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action of attempting suicide, ruling out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I wanted to die when i made that post"" and ""I just don't want to die"". The latter, while seemingly a negation, is presented in a context of extreme distress and struggle, indicating the presence of suicidal thoughts that the user is fighting against, rather than an absence of them.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hopelessness"", ""desperate"", ""meaningless torture"", ""no hope"", ""feel like breaking"", ""dark moment"".
    *   **Specific plans:** There are no mentions of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There is no description of any specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. ""I wanted to die when I made that post"" describes a past *feeling* or *desire*, not a past *action*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not directly.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. The phrase ""I wanted to die when i made that post"" is a clear, unambiguous expression of a past desire to die. While the post also says ""I just don't want to die,"" this is immediately followed by ""but even before and now after that, i have no hope,"" indicating a current struggle with despair and a desire to escape suffering, which aligns with suicidal ideation even if the user is fighting against the impulse. The overall context is one of a clear desire to escape unbearable pain, where death is a considered option.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die expressed (even if framed in the past or as a struggle against it), the post is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): Yes, the desire to die was present and the current hopelessness is profound.
    *   Does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations? No. There is no mention of how, where, or when the person plans to act, nor any preparations.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The phrase ""I wanted to die when I made that post"" refers to a past *feeling* or *thought*, not a *concrete action* taken to attempt suicide. There is no description of what they *did*.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I wanted to die when I made that post"") and current intense feelings of hopelessness and despair, which rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   However, it lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a concrete past action of attempting suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The content fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of a clear desire to not be alive any longer (even if struggling with it) without a specific plan.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point."" It also says, ""I'm ready to say goodbye"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""feel like shit"", ""pretty much a failure"", ""letting everyone down"", ""so broken and lifeless"".
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. ""Ready to say goodbye"" is a general expression of intent, not a concrete preparation like writing a note or acquiring means. The phrase ""but I'm also not"" indicates ambivalence.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""trying to kill myself"". It also expresses a desire to ""say goodbye"". This confirms it's beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal intent (""trying to kill myself"") but does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""pills"", ""jumping""), specific means being acquired (e.g., ""bought a gun""), a specific location (e.g., ""that bridge""), a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"", ""at 21""), or clear preparations (e.g., ""writing my note"", ""giving away things""). ""Ready to say goodbye"" is a general sentiment, not a concrete preparation for an act. The ambivalence (""but I'm also not"") further suggests a lack of a firm, actionable plan. Therefore, no explicit plan is identified.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life. It focuses on current feelings and intent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""trying to kill myself"") and a clear desire to die (""ready to say goodbye"").
    - However, it lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations) as defined for 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - It is clearly more than 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicidal language.
    - Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category, which covers explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a clear desire to not be alive, without a specific plan.

301,The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it. My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of. I could do it right now. The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared to die and I'm scared of the emptiness after death that all I can do is cry myself to sleep and hope that I don't wake up and do wake up at the same time. It's a neverending cycle. I'm done.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""killing myself"", ""fear of death"", ""scared to die"", ""scared of the emptiness after death"", ""hope that I don't wake up"", ""I'm done"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I hate it"", ""scared"", ""cry myself to sleep"", ""neverending cycle"", ""I'm done"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post states ""I could do it right now."" However, this is immediately qualified by ""The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared to die"". It also mentions parents ""taken any means they can think of,"" which implies a *lack* of means available to the poster for a specific plan, rather than the poster having acquired means. There is no specific method, location, or timeframe for *execution* mentioned by the user. The ""I could do it right now"" is a statement of capability, not a declaration of a specific plan with intent to act.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""killing myself"" and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die (""hope that I don't wake up"", ""I'm done""). This confirms it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses suicidal intent. Now, does it mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation?
        *   **Method:** No specific method is mentioned (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump"").
        *   **Means:** The post implies a *lack* of means (""parents have taken any means they can think of""), not that the poster has acquired or possesses means for a plan.
        *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
        *   **Specific Timeframe:** ""I could do it right now"" is a statement of current potential, but it is immediately followed by ""The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared to die"". This indicates that despite the feeling of capability, there is no *committed timeframe* for the act. It's a statement of current state, not a plan for execution.
        *   **Preparation:** No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   Based on the definitions, the post lacks the concrete elements of a plan required for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""killing myself"", ""hope that I don't wake up""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does *not* describe a specific past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   While there is strong suicidal ideation and a feeling of capability (""I could do it right now""), the post explicitly states that fear of death is *preventing* the action, and it lacks any specific method, means, location, or committed timeframe for a plan. The mention of parents taking away means further suggests a lack of current available means for a plan. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""came extraordinarily close to killing myself.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""extraordinarily painful,"" ""desperate"" (past tense), but current tone is hopeful (""made the decision to live,"" ""light at the end of the tunnel is almost here"").
    *   Specific plans: The post explicitly states, ""I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with."" It also mentions ""my letters were written"" and ""I set a date."" These are clear indicators of past planning and preparation.
    *   Past concrete actions: The post describes being ""extraordinarily close"" and having a plan and preparations, but it explicitly states ""I keep living past that date"" and ""I'm still here,"" indicating that the plan was *not* carried out. It does not describe a concrete action of an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains ""came extraordinarily close to killing myself,"" which is an explicit mention of suicide. This means it's more than 'Indicator'.

    *   The post *does not* describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It describes having a plan and being close to acting on it, but explicitly states they ""keep living past that date"" and are ""still here."" This indicates the plan was *not* executed as an attempt. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a described concrete action (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal language (""killing myself"") and describes a past scenario involving a ""set plan,"" ""letters were written,"" and a ""set date."" These elements perfectly align with the definition of 'Behavior' (specific plan, means/preparation, timeframe).
    *   Crucially, the post explicitly states that the plan was *not* carried out as an attempt (""I keep living past that date,"" ""I'm still here""). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt', which requires a *concrete action*.
    *   While the post's current tone is one of resilience, the *content* being described is a past instance of having a suicide plan and making preparations, which falls under 'Behavior'. The categories classify the *content* described in the post.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The post implicitly refers to suicide with phrases like ""not doing it years ago,"" ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" ""wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it,"" and ""wouldn't be here now."" These all clearly indicate a desire to end one's life or not be alive.
    - Emotional indicators: ""angry at myself,"" ""angry that it would be considered selfish.""
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe for a *current* plan, or preparations are mentioned. The timeframes (""years ago,"" ""the first time I thought about it"") refer to past opportunities that were *not* taken, not a current plan.
    - Past concrete actions: The post states ""angry at myself for not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it."" This describes a regret about *not* having taken action in the past, rather than a description of a concrete action that *was* taken.

    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe for *current* action, or preparation? No. The references to ""years ago"" or ""the first time I thought about it"" are about past missed opportunities, not a current plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The phrases ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it"" indicate regret over *not* having attempted, not a description of an actual attempt that occurred. It does not describe what they *did*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive and thoughts about ending life (Step 2), which means it's more than 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, current timeframe, preparation) mentioned (Step 3), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide (Step 4), which rules out 'Attempt'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes (""suicidal"", ""killing myself"").

        - A specific timeframe: No.
        - Clear signs of preparation: Yes, ""written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a clear preparation.
    - Since there are clear signs of preparation (writing a suicide note/will), it strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post describes current ideation and preparation, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""suicidal"", ""wanting to die"", ""killing myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly mentions a specific preparation for suicide: ""i have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This constitutes a plan element (preparation/means) as defined under 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action of attempting suicide.

    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: No past concrete actions are described. The phrase ""never been more suicidal"" refers to a current state of feeling, not a past action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit term ""suicidal"" and expresses a clear desire to not be alive/suicidal intent (""never been more suicidal in my life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

    - No, the post does not mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide. It describes a feeling, not a plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""never been more suicidal in my life,"" which indicates clear suicidal thoughts/feelings. This means it's not 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, so it's not 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The post uses strong, negative language comparing Australia to Auschwitz and a ""prison colony,"" and talks about a ""fascist regime"" and being ""slaves,"" but these are externalized political/social grievances, not direct or indirect mentions of self-harm or suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: Extreme anger, paranoia, sense of oppression, despair about societal conditions, but not personal hopelessness or worthlessness related to the poster's own existence.
    - Specific plans: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post expresses extreme dissatisfaction and anger with the perceived political/social situation, but it does not express a desire for the poster themselves to die or cease existing. The distress is focused on external circumstances and a perceived lack of freedom, not on the poster's own life or desire to end it.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no suicidal intent or desire to die expressed.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Not applicable, as there is no description of a past concrete action to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, there are no explicit suicide terms and no clear desire to die expressed.
    - The post contains general expressions of distress, anger, and dissatisfaction with perceived external circumstances (""This country is a prison colony,"" ""We are all slaves,"" ""no freedom""). This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition, which states that it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life."" The distress is present, but it's not linked to a personal desire to end their life.

    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""i'm considering suicide"".
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""Life is worse than death"" and the context of ""can't fucking take it anymore"" leading to considering suicide.
    - Since there is an explicit mention of ""suicide"" and a clear desire to end distress, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There are no elements of a plan present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post discusses current consideration, not a past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""i'm considering suicide"" and expresses a clear desire to end their suffering (""can't fucking take it anymore,"" ""Life is worse than death""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) mentioned. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan.

311,"I want to help my suicidal online friend who has been through literal hell but I don't know how and I'm scared. I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks. Sorry for the post that is all over the place I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal online friend,"" ""suicide attempts"" (referring to the friend), and most importantly, ""I'm suicidal myself"" (referring to the poster). It also mentions the friend having ""lucid dreams of their body hanging.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The poster expresses being ""scared,"" ""confused,"" ""having a bit of a breakdown,"" and states ""This fucking sucks."" These indicate distress.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post *does not* contain any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations) for the *poster* to commit suicide. It details the *friend's* past attempts but not the poster's plans or past actions.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The post *does not* describe any specific past concrete actions taken by the *poster* to attempt suicide. The statement ""I'm suicidal myself"" describes a current state of mind (ideation), not a past action. The past actions described (""multiple suicide attempts per month"") refer to the *friend*, not the poster.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post contains the explicit phrase ""I'm suicidal myself"" from the perspective of the person writing the post. This clearly indicates suicidal thoughts/feelings.
    *   Since there is an explicit mention of being suicidal by the poster, it is more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The poster states ""I'm suicidal myself,"" indicating suicidal intent.
    *   However, the post *does not* mention any specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide *by the poster*. The details about attempts belong to the friend.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post *does not* describe any specific past concrete action the *poster* took to try to end their life. The description of ""multiple suicide attempts per month"" refers to the *friend*, not the poster. The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' for the poster.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The poster explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself."" This falls under the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings.""
    *   Crucially, there is no specific plan mentioned by the poster, nor is there a description of a past concrete suicide attempt by the poster.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit phrases like ""kill me"" and ""end my life,"" which are direct expressions of wanting to die. This means it is more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die, but it does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills""), specific means being acquired (e.g., ""bought a rope""), a specific location (e.g., ""from the bridge""), a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), or any preparations (e.g., ""writing a note""). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above. Thanks, have a good day.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end my own life"", ""suicide"", ""killing myself"". The post explicitly discusses the concept of suicide as a solution.
    - Emotional indicators: ""anger issues"", ""caused hurt"", ""emotional pain"", ""numbers dwindle by the day"", ""cry for help"". There is clear distress and a sense of burden.
    - Specific plans: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., bought a gun, acquired pills), location (e.g., specific bridge), or timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"", ""at 21"") is mentioned. No preparations are described.
    - Past concrete actions: The post states, ""I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone,"" which refers to self-directed anger/harm, but it does not describe a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""end my own life,"" ""suicide,"" and ""killing myself."" It also expresses a clear desire not to be alive (""the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth"").
    - This means the post is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2, the post expresses suicidal intent. However, it does not mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for carrying out suicide. The discussion is philosophical and logical, rather than practical planning.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. The mention of ""never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own"" is about past self-harm or anger expression, not a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end their life (""end my own life"", ""killing myself"", ""suicide""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) mentioned. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.

Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""end it all,"" ""don't want to be here."" These are clear expressions of a desire to cease living.
    - Emotional indicators: ""so tired,"" ""won't ever be happy,"" ""everything is a chore, everyday is pressure."" These indicate hopelessness and despair.
    - Specific plans: The post mentions ""I can't get hold of a gun which would solve everything."" This identifies a specific method/tool (gun) that the poster believes would achieve their goal of ending their life. The follow-up question ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"" further reinforces the active consideration of methods.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/cease existing: ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""end it all,"" ""don't want to be here."" Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? Yes, it mentions a specific tool/weapon (""gun"") with clear intent (""which would solve everything""). Even though the poster states they ""can't get hold of"" it, the identification of a specific method/tool that ""would solve everything"" constitutes a plan element as defined in 'Behavior' (specific tools/weapons with clear intent for suicide). The subsequent question about ""a good option for us to end it all"" further indicates an active search or consideration of methods.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I don't want it anymore,"" ""end it all,"" ""don't want to be here""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - It explicitly mentions a specific method/tool (""gun"") that the poster associates with ending their life (""would solve everything""). This goes beyond general ideation and into the realm of considering specific means/methods, even if currently inaccessible. This fits the 'Behavior' definition which includes ""specific tools/weapons (e.g., knives/guns/ropes) or substances (e.g., lethal medication/drugs) with clear intent for suicide."" The active thought process about *how* to end it (""Why isn't there a good option..."") further supports 'Behavior'.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains ""I wish I could die"" (twice) and ""I would worry about them if I died"". It also says ""I would die for them"" but this is clearly an idiom of love, not suicidal intent. The key phrases are ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die"" in contexts of distress.
    - Emotional indicators: ""hate my parents"", ""not doing so great"", ""I feel like a failure"", ""I have anxiety and depression"", ""God but sometimes he feels so far away"", ""I have no one to talk to"". These indicate significant distress, feelings of worthlessness, and isolation.
    - Specific plans: No mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die"" are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/not be alive.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die expressed, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method for suicide? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location being considered for suicide? No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There are no elements of a plan as defined for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post does not describe any actions taken.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear expressions of a desire to die (""I wish I could die,"" ""I wish I could curl up and die""). This indicates suicidal ideation.
    - There are no specific plans (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.

    - Emotional indicators: ""disappointed in myself,"" ""dislike it,"" ""feel like shit,"" ""hate it,"" ""felt disgusted,"" ""disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself,"" ""ugly I felt."" These indicate strong negative emotions, self-disgust, and distress.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post repeatedly mentions ""suicide,"" ""die prematurely,"" ""end my life,"" and ""wanting to end my life."" The author states, ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses a strong sense of conviction about suicide as a solution, frustration with societal stigma, and a feeling of not being heard or supported. The phrase ""I'm tired from working another long shift last night"" is a statement about physical tiredness, not directly an emotional indicator of suicidal distress, but the overall tone of the post is one of deep despair and a desire to escape life.
    *   **Specific plans:** There are no mentions of a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or preparations for suicide. The ""I'm going to bed"" at the end refers to sleep, not a suicidal act.

K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""self harm,"" ""cutting,"" and ""scars."" It describes a past incident: ""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out."" This is a description of a past concrete action of self-harm, strongly implying cutting.

    *   The post does not contain explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" directly from the poster regarding themselves.
    *   However, the phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is a clear expression of questioning the value of life and a desire not to be alive, fitting the definition for 'Ideation' (e.g., ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want it all to end"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   No specific future plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations) for suicide is mentioned by the poster. The post focuses on past actions and current feelings of invalidation.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post describes a ""specific past concrete action"" the poster took: ""A few months ago... i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out."" This is a concrete action of self-harm.
    *   The 'Attempt' definition includes examples like ""when I tried to cut my wrists."" While the poster states the intent was ""to relieve some of the pain"" rather than explicitly ""to end my life,"" severe self-harm incidents like the one described (implied cutting, leading to the girlfriend ""freaking out,"" and the presence of ""a dozen scars"") are often considered within the scope of suicidal behaviors and attempts, especially given the example provided in the definition. The severity and nature of the action align with what could be considered an attempt, even if the immediate stated intent was pain relief. In a suicide risk classification context, such a severe past self-harm incident is a critical indicator.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear desire not to be alive (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore""), which means it is at least 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not describe a *future* plan, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   It *does* describe a ""specific past concrete action"" of self-harm that aligns with the examples provided for 'Attempt' (e.g., ""when I tried to cut my wrists""). Despite the ambiguity of the explicit intent (""pain relief"" vs. ""end life""), the severity of the action and its description as a concrete past event of self-harm makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate classification according to the provided definitions and examples. The presence of current ideation alongside a past concrete self-harm incident further supports this classification.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""act on my suicidal thoughts.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depressive spell,"" ""spiraling worse,"" ""worry,"" ""nightmare,"" ""hell do I do."" Mentions bipolar 1, visual hallucinations, and delusions. Describes a struggle with coping methods and lack of support.
    *   **Specific plans:** There is no mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide. The user states, ""while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change,"" indicating a current *lack* of a concrete plan and an intention to *prevent* acting on thoughts by seeking hospital care.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts."" This confirms it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but *does not* include any specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for carrying out suicide. In fact, the user expresses a desire to go to the hospital ""than act on my suicidal thoughts."" This clearly indicates the *absence* of a plan, not the presence. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to cut myself""). Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts,"" which means it expresses a clear desire not to be alive or suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does *not* contain any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation), ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does *not* describe a specific past concrete action of attempting suicide, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings without a plan perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation'. The user is struggling with these thoughts and actively seeking ways to *avoid* acting on them.

320,"I hope I die soon. I have started to do heroin pretty much daily. Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution for drug addicts and mentally ill people and be forced anti psychotics there. Fuck that I once took a anti psychotic and it just kills me inside and some 'other person' takes over. My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead."" These are direct expressions of a desire to die.
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, anger (""Fuck that,"" ""Fuck them!""), feeling controlled, fear of institutionalization and medication.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: No specific method for suicide is mentioned. The heroin use is described as a daily habit, not as a suicide method.
        - Means: No specific means are mentioned.
        - Location: No specific location is mentioned.
        - Timeframe: ""Soon I will be finally dead."" ""Soon"" is a vague timeframe, not specific enough (like ""tonight"" or ""on my birthday"") to qualify for 'Behavior'. The ""within 4 weeks"" refers to forced institutionalization, not the act of suicide itself.
        - Preparations: No preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes, giving away possessions) are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide are described. The mention of taking an anti-psychotic in the past refers to an experience with medication, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die: ""I hope I die soon,"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations? No. The timeframe ""soon"" is too vague. The heroin use is a daily habit, not presented as a method for suicide. There are no other elements of a plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The past mention of taking an anti-psychotic was an experience with medication, not a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear and explicit desire to die (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead"").
    - It is not 'Behavior' because, while there is a strong desire to die, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations) mentioned. ""Soon"" is not a specific enough timeframe.
    - It is not 'Attempt' because no specific past concrete action of a suicide attempt is described.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes clear expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The core of the post is ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem."" This is a direct inquiry about a method to cause death to oneself.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things."" This indicates severe anhedonia, hopelessness, and a strong dismissal of protective factors, reinforcing a desire to die.
    *   **Specific plans:** The question about the ""position of the gun"" for ""hitting the brain stem"" is a clear inquiry about a specific *method* and *means* for suicide. It indicates active planning or consideration of how to execute the act effectively.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No mention of past actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? While the exact words aren't used, the phrase ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem"" in the context of dismissing reasons to live is an unambiguous expression of wanting to end one's life. It's a direct inquiry about a lethal method.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, the entire context of asking about the most effective gun position for a lethal shot, combined with the dismissal of life's value, clearly indicates a desire to die.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die/end life. This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method** for suicide? Yes, using a ""gun"" and specifically aiming for the ""brain stem"" is a specific method.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent? The mention of ""the gun"" implies possession or immediate access/intent to use.
        *   A specific **location**? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**? No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? Asking for specific technical details on how to carry out the act (gun position for brain stem) is a strong sign of preparation/planning.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, there is a specific method and means being discussed, indicating a plan. This strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post is about current considerations and planning.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (Step 2).
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by inquiring about a specific method (""gun"") and specific means (""the gun"") and how to effectively use it (""position... for hitting the brain stem""). This falls squarely under the 'Behavior' definition, which requires explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a plan, including a specific method or means.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear desire to die and a specific method/means mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because a specific method/means is being discussed, moving it beyond just thoughts or a general desire.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past concrete action is described.

Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thought about killing myself,"" ""self harm scars.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""everything just keeps getting worse,"" ""upset.""
    - Specific plans: None mentioned. There is no method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: The post mentions ""self harm scars,"" which indicates past self-harm. However, it does *not* describe a specific concrete action taken to *attempt suicide*. It only mentions the *scars*, not an action aimed at ending life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head.""
    - Since there are explicit mentions of ""killing myself"" and a clear desire/preoccupation with ending life, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - The post describes persistent thoughts (""haven't thought about killing myself,"" ""it won't leave my head"") but no concrete plan elements. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life?
    - The post mentions ""my self harm scars."" While self-harm can be related to suicidal ideation, the definition for 'Attempt' requires a ""specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life."" The post does not describe *what* the person did to attempt suicide, nor does it explicitly state that the self-harm was an *attempt* to end their life. It simply refers to the *scars*. This is not sufficient for 'Attempt' as it does not describe a concrete action of an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""thought about killing myself"") and a clear, persistent preoccupation with them (""it wont leave my head""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - The mention of ""self harm scars"" indicates past self-harm, but it does not describe a *specific past concrete action* taken to *attempt suicide*. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
    - The post perfectly aligns with the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like 'suicide,' 'kill myself') OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself"", ""Let's just do it"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what the fuck to do anymore"", ""No amount of sleep helps, I still feel like trash"", ""I'm sick of life"" (hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, dissatisfaction).
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or timeframe mentioned. No preparations. ""Let's just do it"" expresses intent but not a concrete plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""killing myself"" and a clear desire to die (""I'm sick of life"", ""Let's just do it"").
    - This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal intent/desire to die.
    - Does it mention a specific method? No.
    - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
    - A specific location? No.
    - A specific timeframe? No (beyond general immediate intent of ""Let's just do it"", which is not a *specific* timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""on my birthday"").
    - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - While ""Let's just do it"" conveys urgency, it lacks the specificity required for 'Behavior' (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation). It's a strong expression of intent but not a plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""killing myself"", ""I'm sick of life"", ""Let's just do it"").
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - It does not contain any specific elements of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation) as defined for 'Behavior'. The phrase ""Let's just do it"" is a strong statement of intent but not a concrete plan.
    - Therefore, it best fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed."" This is a clear description of a past concrete action. ""after my first attempt at the beginning of this year"" also refers to a past attempt, but the overdose description is more concrete.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post describes specific past concrete actions: ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed."" This clearly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains both a clear expression of suicidal intent with a specific timeframe for a future act (pointing to 'Behavior') AND a description of specific past concrete actions taken to end their life (""I've tried to overdose three times"").
    *   According to the 'Attempt' definition: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire for the pain to end, implying a desire to end their life/existence, which means it is more than 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.

I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society.

        - ""I should have killed myself a long time ago."" (Direct mention of past suicidal ideation/action)
        - ""I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is."" (Specific method, clear desire to die)
        - ""I promise I wont fail this time."" (Implies previous failed attempt)
        - ""Gonna be gone after this weekend."" (Direct statement of impending death)
    - **Emotional indicators:** ""drowning in depression,"" ""self hatred,"" ""I cant take it anymore,"" ""I cant do this,"" ""I am trash,"" ""I'm a disgrace,"" ""I hate myself too,"" ""I'm broken,"" ""I'm damaged,"" ""I'm all fucked up."" (Extreme distress, hopelessness, worthlessness).

        - **Method:** ""hanging""
        - **Means/Tools:** ""I'm gonna buy the right stuff.""
        - **Timeframe:** ""Gonna be gone after this weekend.""
        - **Preparations:** ""Say my goodbyes to the one I love.""
    - **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:**
        - ""I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This describes a past concrete action (""I tried"") to end their life, which ""didn't work."" This fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""kill myself"" and clear expressions of wanting to die (""It's over for me,"" ""Gonna be gone after this weekend"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, the post mentions a specific method (""hanging""), means/preparations (""buy the right stuff,"" ""Say my goodbyes""), and a specific timeframe (""after this weekend""). This clearly indicates a plan, fitting the 'Behavior' criteria.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action: ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This indicates a previous failed attempt to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal intent and a clear desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a detailed plan with method, means, timeframe, and preparation, which points to 'Behavior'.
    - Crucially, it also describes a past concrete action taken to end their life (""I tried. But it didn't work."").
    - The 'Attempt' definition states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'.""
    - Since both a past concrete action (attempt) and current plans (behavior) are present, the 'Attempt' category takes precedence according to the rules.

But I'm really grateful to be able to meet you all, if by any chance there is another life, i wish we could hang out again. But this life for me isn't it. Ill update back on this post innnn 8 yrs or so. Maybe? Who knows. No promises &gt;:) anyway, I hope you all have a great day and thank you for reading to whatever this is",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I'm planning on killing myself"". It also uses phrases like ""Adios i can't. It's not worth it."", ""this life for me isn't it.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't know what's wrong with me."", ""I'm sorry to the people i know in advance."" (indicates distress, potential despair, and a sense of finality).
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method:** Not explicitly mentioned.
        *   **Means:** Not explicitly mentioned.
        *   **Locations:** Not explicitly mentioned.
        *   **Specific timeframes:** ""at 30 or 25"", ""by the time im around that age"". This is a clear, albeit future, timeframe for the intended act.
        *   **Preparations:** ""I'm sorry to the people i know in advance."" could be seen as a form of pre-emptive goodbye.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past concrete actions are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""killing myself"" and clear expressions of wanting to end life (""Adios i can't. It's not worth it."", ""this life for me isn't it.""). Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    *   The post mentions a specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide: ""at 30 or 25"" and ""by the time im around that age"". The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., 'I'm ending it tonight,' 'I plan to do it on my birthday,' 'I'll kill myself at 21')"". The post directly matches the example ""I'll kill myself at 21"" but with different ages. This constitutes a plan element.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. It discusses future plans.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""killing myself"" and desire to end life). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes a specific timeframe (""at 30 or 25"") for the planned act. According to the definition, the mention of a specific timeframe is a key criterion for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Because a specific timeframe (a component of a plan) is mentioned, it is more than just 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The term ""suicide rate"" is present.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" indicates distress or being close to a breaking point. ""Perceived as male and a threat"" suggests a source of this distress.
    - Specific plans: None.
    - Past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide rate.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. While ""teetering on the edge"" suggests distress, it is not an unambiguous expression of wanting to die. The mention of ""suicide rate"" is a statistical observation and social commentary, not an expression of the poster's own desire to die. The post does not say ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" or similar phrases indicating the poster's own suicidal intent.

    Based on the definitions, for a post to be 'Ideation' or higher, there must be an *explicit expression concerning suicide* (e.g., ""I'm suicidal"") OR a *clear desire to die* (e.g., ""I want to die""). The mention of ""suicide rate"" is about a general statistic, not the poster's personal desire. ""Teetering on the edge"" is too vague to be a ""clear desire to die."" Therefore, the post does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' or higher.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no clear suicidal intent from the poster.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Not applicable, as no past concrete action is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress (""teetering on the edge"") and discusses a social issue related to suicide (""suicide rate for men"").
    - It does not contain an explicit statement of the poster's own suicidal thoughts or a clear, unambiguous desire to die. The mention of ""suicide rate"" is observational/statistical, not an expression of personal intent.
    - The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" falls under ""general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life"" as described in the 'Indicator' definition. It does not meet the ""clear desire to not be alive any longer"" threshold required for 'Ideation'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide is a coward way to go out"" (direct mention of suicide), ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone"" (indirect but clear reference to ending life in this context).
    - Emotional indicators: Sarcastic ""Thanks mom."", "":("", and ""struggling"" indicate distress, despair. ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling"" sounds like a farewell message.
    - Specific plans: ""within 24 hours"" is a specific timeframe. ""Peace out all"" and ""I wish the best for you all out here struggling"" can be interpreted as a form of goodbye or preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mention of ""suicide"" and a clear desire to die (""Don't be surprised if I'm gone"" in the context of suicide). Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present):
        - Specific method: No.
        - Specific means: No.
        - Specific location: No.
        - Specific timeframe: Yes, ""within 24 hours"" is a specific timeframe.
        - Clear signs of preparation: ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling"" can be seen as a final goodbye, which is a sign of preparation.
    - The presence of a specific timeframe and signs of preparation indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It refers to a future possibility.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal intent/desire to die.
    - It includes a specific timeframe (""within 24 hours"") and elements of preparation (a farewell message). These elements meet the criteria for a ""plan"" under the 'Behavior' definition (specifically, a specific timeframe).
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because it includes a specific timeframe and elements of preparation, which constitute a plan.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Behavior'.

My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""it's killing me"" is present. This is an idiomatic expression for extreme emotional pain, not a literal statement of suicidal intent or a desire to die by one's own hand.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Abused,"" ""don't have a choice,"" ""didn't believe me,"" ""dismissed me,"" ""bullied and emotionally manipulated,"" ""hate myself,"" ""threatened my safety and possibly even my life,"" ""forced into staying silent,"" ""can't go to counseling,"" ""prevent me from moving out,"" ""no proof."" These indicate severe distress, helplessness, self-blame, and a desire for freedom/safety.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of any method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide. The plans mentioned are related to escaping the abuse (restraining order, moving out).
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want it all to end,"" ""I'm going to die soon"" when in a context of severe distress)? No. The phrase ""it's killing me"" refers to the emotional toll of the situation, not a literal desire to die by suicide. The explicit desire is to get a restraining order and move out, not to end their life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no clear suicidal intent or desire to die established in Step 2, this post does not fit the criteria for 'Behavior'. There are no elements of a suicide plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant emotional distress, helplessness, and a desire to escape an abusive situation. However, it *lacks* any explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or a clear, unambiguous desire to die by suicide. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is an idiom for extreme emotional suffering, not a literal statement of suicidal intent.
    *   Based on the definitions:
        *   'Attempt' is ruled out as no past concrete action is described.
        *   'Behavior' is ruled out as there is no suicidal intent *and* no plan.
        *   'Ideation' is ruled out as there are no explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a clear desire to not be alive.
        *   'Indicator' fits best: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., 'life sucks,' 'I'm so unhappy,' 'I feel worthless,' 'I'm struggling')."" This post clearly falls into this category due to the severe distress and hopelessness expressed without any direct or indirect suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""self harm"", ""harming"", ""bloodying myself up now"", ""kill myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, feeling overwhelmed (""every little problem, every panic attack... ended with my harming""), feeling like promises were broken.
    - Specific plans: ""I should do it now and save time."" - This indicates a specific timeframe (""now"") and a clear intent to act immediately. The self-harm described is current (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") and explicitly linked to the progression towards suicide (""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"").
    - Past concrete actions: The post describes current and past self-harm (""I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend... I'm self harming again. I'm bloodying myself up now""), but it does not describe a past *suicide attempt* (i.e., an action taken with the intent to die that failed).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and a clear desire to die (""I should do it now and save time"").
    - This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - The post mentions a specific **timeframe**: ""I should do it now"". This is a clear, immediate timeframe for carrying out the act.
    - While a specific method for suicide isn't explicitly detailed (e.g., ""take pills""), the current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") is presented as a direct precursor and part of the progression towards ""kill myself,"" which, combined with the ""now"" timeframe, strongly points to 'Behavior'. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a specific timeframe for the act.""

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It describes current and past self-harm, but not a past suicide *attempt*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" (ruling out 'Indicator').
    - It does not describe a past concrete suicide attempt (ruling out 'Attempt').
    - It goes beyond mere ideation by including a specific, immediate timeframe for the act (""I should do it now"") and describes current self-harm that is presented as leading directly to suicide. This combination of explicit suicidal intent and a specific timeframe/imminent action fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""someone blow my head off,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" ""please kill me."" These are direct expressions of wanting to die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""im fucking done,"" ""tired if these stupidass ignorant people."" (despair, exhaustion, self-loathing, anger).
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned by the poster for themselves. The phrases ""someone blow my head off"" and ""please kill me"" are desires for external action, not a self-initiated plan.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die: ""someone blow my head off,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" ""please kill me,"" ""im fucking done."" This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a strong desire to die and even a specific *way* of dying (being killed by someone else), but it does not describe a *self-initiated plan* by the poster to commit suicide. There is no mention of a method *they* will use, means *they* will acquire, a location *they* will go to, a timeframe *they* will act within, or preparations *they* are making. The request ""someone blow my head off"" or ""please kill me"" is a plea for external action, not an internal plan for self-harm. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""im fucking done,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" ""please kill me"") and even uses strong imagery of death (""someone blow my head off""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - However, the post does not describe a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) that the individual intends to carry out themselves. The desire to be killed by someone else, while severe, doesn't constitute a self-initiated plan for suicide as defined for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete attempt.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide by the individual.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""cut my life short"", ""if I ended my life right now"". These are direct expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""very anxious"", ""struggle"".
    - Specific plans: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., bought a rope, wrote a note), location, or specific timeframe for action. The phrase ""right now"" is part of a hypothetical statement (""if I ended my life right now this wouldn't be a problem""), not a declaration of immediate intent or a plan.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now"", which are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to end one's life or considering suicide.
    - Since the answer is 'Yes', it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2, suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - Does the post mention a specific method? No.
    - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
    - A specific location? No.
    - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No. ""right now"" is hypothetical, not a concrete plan. The post discusses future anxiety (graduation next year) and long-term issues, but doesn't state a specific time for an act.
    - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there are no explicit plan elements (method, means, location, specific timeframe, preparation), it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There is no mention of ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to cut,"" etc.

    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""cut my life short"", ""ended my life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - However, it lacks any specific plan elements (method, means, location, specific timeframe, preparations) that would classify it as 'Behavior'. The mention of ""right now"" is conditional and part of a hypothetical outcome, not a planned action.
    - It does not describe any past concrete actions, ruling out 'Attempt'.

I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

    - Emotional indicators: ""failure"", ""can't stand the person looking back at me"", ""despise myself"", ""scared"", ""content in knowing that if I was gone"". Strong indicators of hopelessness, worthlessness, self-loathing, and despair.
    - Specific plans: The post describes past actions (""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"", ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers""). It does not describe a *future* specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations) for a *current* or *future* suicide act.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: Yes, ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again"" is a very specific description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" also points to past attempts, and the detailed description confirms one of them.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:

This details the method (pills), the means (specific types and quantities of pills), and the timeframe (yesterday), and the intent (hoped I wouldn't wake up). This perfectly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (ruling out 'Indicator').
    - It describes a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life (""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"").
    - According to the 'Attempt' definition, ""The content describes one or more specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life... A concrete action (what the person *did*) must be described."" This post meets that criterion.
    - The definition further states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" In this case, there is current ideation (""I want to die"") alongside the described past attempt. The presence of the described past concrete action is the determining factor.

Being a Man it is hard for me to find love and I am attacked for dating to have standards (just want a fair deal (and no I am not talking about looks); I am not asking for some blonde hair princess). Women can valuation and offers while a Man has to do all the work (yay equality amirite /s). I've been bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life. My parents won't accept me for who I am because I do not believe the harsh faith I was raised and have no way out cause I don't have a loving partner to go to. And I have other issues with them.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No direct mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""horrible life,"" ""life sucks,"" ""total curse,"" ""bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life,"" ""I have nothing."" These indicate significant distress, despair, and a sense of victimhood/hopelessness about their circumstances.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. While the post expresses extreme dissatisfaction and calls life a ""total curse,"" it does not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" or similar unambiguous desires to cease existing. It focuses on the perceived unfairness and hardship of their life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die, this step is not applicable for classifying as 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, unhappiness, and dissatisfaction with life (""horrible life,"" ""life sucks,"" ""total curse,"" ""bullied, harassed, treated like shit""). It highlights feelings of worthlessness (""I have nothing"") and being attacked.
    *   However, it *lacks* any explicit expression concerning suicide and *lacks* a clear desire to die or end one's life. The language used falls squarely within the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""life sucks,"" ""I'm so unhappy,"" ""I feel worthless,"" ""I'm struggling"").""
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no ""clear desire to not be alive any longer"" or ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings.""
    *   It does not meet 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' as there is no plan or description of a past concrete action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm feeling suicidal,"" ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more,"" ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""not able to deal with what's going to happen,"" ""getting panic attacks,"" ""not able to sleep properly,"" ""feel like a burden.""
    - Specific plans: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., ""I have the pills""), location (e.g., ""that bridge""), timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or preparations (e.g., ""writing notes,"" ""giving things away) are mentioned. The phrase ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide"" expresses intent/desire, not a plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal"" and ""suicide."" It also expresses a clear desire to end the situation through suicide (""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide"").
    - This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2, the post expresses suicidal intent. However, it does not mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for carrying out suicide. It states the *desire* for suicide as an escape, but not *how* or *when* it would be done.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It focuses on current feelings and thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'm feeling suicidal,"" ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more,"" ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide""). This eliminates 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation). This eliminates 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. This eliminates 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a clear desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post clearly mentions a specific method (""jump""), specific means (""Amtrak or Metrolink,"" ""trains""), and a specific location (""tracks""). It also mentions preparatory knowledge (""know the train schedule pretty well,"" ""live really close to the tracks"") and seeking advice on how to execute the plan (""How do I stay on the tracks?""). This fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action: ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."" This directly states a past attempt and provides a concrete detail (911 call) related to it.
    *   The post also describes other concrete actions related to past attempts, even if aborted at the last minute (""the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute,"" ""when I see it, I panic and jump away"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation and intent, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It contains a specific, detailed plan (method, means, location, preparatory knowledge) which would classify it as 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the post *also* explicitly describes a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide: ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."" The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" Since both conditions are met (a described concrete past attempt AND current detailed plans), 'Attempt' is the correct classification.

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation. There's nothing there for me and nobody wants me to be there either. I don't even want to be there.

    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to kill myself"", ""constantly suicidal"", ""assisted suicide""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the definitions, the post fits 'Ideation' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan.

344,Gonna end myself soon. Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""Gonna end myself soon"" is a direct statement of suicidal intent. ""OD on"" indicates a method of self-harm/suicide (overdose).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Clear intent to die, severe distress.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method:** ""OD on"" (overdose).
        *   **Means:** ""1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"" (specific substances/drugs). The phrase ""Have 1g..."" indicates possession of these means.
        *   **Timeframe:** ""soon"" (implies immediate or near-future intent).
        *   **Preparations:** The statement ""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"" indicates that the means are acquired and ready, which is a clear sign of preparation.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, ""Gonna end myself soon"" is an explicit mention of suicide and a clear desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent is present.
    *   The post mentions a specific **method** (""OD on"").
    *   It mentions specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent (""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"").
    *   It mentions a timeframe (""soon"") and clear **preparation** (having the substances).
    *   This strongly indicates 'Behavior' as it contains multiple elements of a plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states a desire to die (""Gonna end myself soon"").
    *   It also clearly outlines a plan by specifying the method (""OD on"") and the means that are currently possessed (""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac""). This directly aligns with the 'Behavior' definition which requires explicit suicidal thoughts/desire *and* a plan including method, means, or preparation.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because there is explicit suicidal intent.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because there is a specific plan (method and means are identified and possessed).
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because it describes a future action/current plan, not a past concrete action.

The neighbors that I had before were my playmates, but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I'm sorry if this was too long a read.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" - This describes a past action of self-harm with suicidal intent (implied by ""couldn't go through with it"" and the overall context). This is a concrete action.
        *   ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood."" - Explicit imagination of self-inflicted death.
        *   ""My mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak."" - Direct mention of ""kill themselves.""
        *   ""My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it."" - Direct mention of ""suicide"" and a current feeling/desire to act on it.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Lonely,"" ""constantly feeling alone,"" ""bullied,"" ""didn't really make much friends,"" ""drifted away,"" ""don't fit in,"" ""inconvenience,"" ""coward."" (Strong indicators of isolation, worthlessness, hopelessness).
    *   **Specific plans:** There is no *current* specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations) mentioned for a *future* suicide act. The knife to the wrist was a *past* repeated action.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" This describes a specific past concrete action (placing a knife to the wrist) taken with the intent to try to end their life, even if the final step of cutting was not completed.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" and ""kill themselves.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die/end life expressed: ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead,"" and ""I feel like I just need to do it.""
    *   Therefore, it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   While there is current suicidal ideation (""I feel like I just need to do it""), the post does *not* describe a *current* specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for a *future* suicide attempt. The knife to the wrist was a past action.
    *   Therefore, it does not fit the 'Behavior' definition for a *current* plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post states: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut.""
    *   This clearly describes ""specific past concrete actions"" the poster took ""to try to end their life."" The action of ""had a knife to my wrist"" with the intent implied by ""couldn't cut"" and ""feel like a coward for not going through with it"" fits the definition of a concrete action taken to attempt suicide.
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" Here, it refers to past attempts (concrete actions) and also mentions current suicidal feelings/desire (""I feel like I just need to do it"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a *current* specific plan for suicide, so it's not 'Behavior' based on a current plan.
    *   However, it explicitly describes ""specific past concrete actions"" taken to try to end their life (""had a knife to my wrist 3x""). This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'. The fact that they ""couldn't cut"" does not negate the concrete action taken with suicidal intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""before I kill myself"" is a direct mention of suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I have done fucked up stuff,"" ""I am not entirely a good person,"" ""I really need to feel loved- is that possible?,"" ""is there any hope of still being loved despite it?"" These indicate feelings of guilt, low self-worth, a desperate need for love/acceptance, and potentially hopelessness regarding that.
    *   Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"") is mentioned. ""Before I kill myself"" indicates a potential future action but lacks specificity for a plan.
    *   Past concrete actions: There are no descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. The ""fucked up stuff"" refers to past actions done *to others*, not self-harm or suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly states ""before I kill myself."" This clearly indicates suicidal intent.

    *   The post does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means being acquired (e.g., ""bought a gun""), a specific location (e.g., ""that bridge""), a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my birthday""), or clear signs of preparation (e.g., ""writing note,"" ""giving things away""). The phrase ""before I kill myself"" is a conditional statement about a future action, not a specific plan.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. The ""fucked up stuff"" refers to past wrongdoings, not suicide attempts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

348,"To anyone that might read this. During lockdown here in Denmark, we had a long winter. I've always felt I've never done what I set out to do and never really connected with people.

Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write.

    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""end myself again tonight"", ""end it tonight again"", ""trying to overdose"". These are direct expressions of suicidal intent.

    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method:** ""overdose""
        *   **Timeframe:** ""tonight"" (mentioned twice)
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The word ""again"" implies a past attempt, but the post *does not describe* a specific past concrete action (e.g., ""I took pills last month and survived""). It states an intention to repeat a future action. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a description of *what they did*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""end myself"" and ""end it,"" which are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life. While ""again"" implies a past attempt, it does not provide details of *what* was done. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a description of the concrete action. Therefore, this post does not classify as 'Attempt' based on the strict definition.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""end myself"", ""end it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post also includes a specific plan, detailing both a method (""overdose"") and a timeframe (""tonight""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation' and squarely into 'Behavior'.
    *   Although the word ""again"" suggests a past attempt, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action. Therefore, it does not meet the strict definition for 'Attempt'. The primary focus of the post is a current, actionable plan.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly indicates a desire to die with a specific method and timeframe.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""knows they're dying,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" ""My death will release my pain.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""can't fight anymore,"" ""can't try anymore,"" ""so tired,"" ""pain,"" ""tortured soul."" These indicate severe hopelessness, exhaustion, and despair.
    - Specific plans:

        - Locations: None mentioned.
        - Specific timeframes: ""in the next month or two"" - This is a specific timeframe.
        - Preparations: ""For anyone who has read this, thank you. Even if just one person reads this, it means a lot to me that you did."" This has the tone of a farewell or final message, which can be a sign of preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" etc.
    - OR, other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: Yes. ""I think my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" ""My death will release my pain."" These are clear expressions of a desire to die/cease existing.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No.
        - Specific means: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: Yes, ""in the next month or two."" This is a specific timeframe.
        - Clear signs of preparation: Yes, the farewell-like message (""For anyone who has read this, thank you..."").
    - The presence of a specific timeframe is sufficient to classify it as 'Behavior' according to the definition.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post discusses current feelings and future intent, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""My death will release my pain""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post includes a specific timeframe (""in the next month or two"") for this desire to end, which, according to the 'Behavior' definition, constitutes a plan element. The farewell-like tone further supports preparation.
    - It does not describe a specific past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Because a specific timeframe (a plan element) is present, it is stronger than 'Ideation'.

As you all well know,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""no interest in modern life,"" ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible,"" ""each year has got worse.""
    - Specific plans: The post says ""I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day."" This indicates thinking about *methods* in general, but it does not specify *a* particular method, means, location, or a specific timeframe for carrying out an act. It's contemplation, not a stated plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts."" This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post states ""I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day."" While this shows a preoccupation with methods, it does *not* specify a concrete method (e.g., ""I'm going to take pills""), specific means, a specific location, or a specific timeframe for the act. It's a general statement about contemplation, not the articulation of a plan.
    - According to the definition, 'Behavior' requires a *specific* method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation. The post does not provide any of these specific elements. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses ""suicidal thoughts,"" moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - It expresses suicidal thoughts but *without* a specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe for the act, or preparations). The phrase ""contemplate method"" indicates ideation about methods, not the formation of a concrete plan. This perfectly aligns with the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me). I was loyal and did that. &amp;#x200B;. And suffered through all of this hell because of that decision",1,ideation,"<thinking>

    - Emotional indicators: The post is filled with indicators of extreme distress, helplessness, feeling trapped, anger, and hopelessness (""I'm at my rope's end,"" ""I hate it so much,"" ""I feel so trapped,"" ""I know no one can save me,"" ""The helplessness I feel"").
    - Specific plans: There are no mentions of a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe for a suicidal act, or preparations for suicide. The date ""Jan 19th"" refers to returning to a house, not a suicide plan.
    - Past concrete actions: There is no description of any specific past concrete action taken by the poster to attempt suicide. The mention of surviving meningitis and losing an ear refers to a medical event, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post does not use explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - However, it contains a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die: ""I jsut want to die."" This satisfies the condition for a clear desire to die.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, the post is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a desire to die.
    - However, it does not mention any specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means being acquired (e.g., ""bought a gun,"" ""have the pills ready""), a specific location for suicide, a specific timeframe for carrying out suicide (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my birthday""), or clear signs of preparation (e.g., ""writing note,"" ""giving things away"").
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. The medical history mentioned (meningitis, ear loss) is not a self-inflicted action.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die (""I jsut want to die""), which means it is beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe for the act, or preparations), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a specific past concrete action of a suicide attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.

I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree. I want to tell a suicide hotline but I don't want to be locked up in a mental facility and never be able to get out. I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""suicide hotline"" and ""driving 100 mph into a tree,"" which is a clear contemplation of a suicidal act.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what to do,"" ""I feel like I'm a fuck up,"" ""can never get anything right,"" ""genuinely stupid human being,"" ""don't want to be locked up."" These indicate hopelessness, worthlessness, and distress.
    - Specific plans: ""I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree."" This is a specific method (driving into a tree), means (car), location (a tree), and a very specific timeframe (right now, thinking of doing it).
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide hotline"" implies suicidal thoughts.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" is an unambiguous expression of suicidal intent.
    - Conclusion: Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific **method**: Yes, ""driving 100 mph into a tree.""
        - Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: Yes, ""car"" is the means, and the person is ""sitting in my car right now.""
        - A specific **location** being considered for suicide: Yes, ""a tree.""
        - A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide: Yes, ""right now thinking of driving."" This indicates immediate consideration.
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: While not explicit preparation like writing a note, being in the car and actively thinking of the act is a form of immediate contemplation/readiness.
    - Conclusion: Yes, there are multiple elements of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe). This strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No, the post describes current thoughts and a current plan, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""suicide hotline,"" ""thinking of driving...into a tree""), so it is not 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a specific plan with method (""driving""), means (""car""), location (""tree""), and a current timeframe (""right now thinking""), which fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of a specific plan differentiates it from 'Ideation'.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly falls under 'Behavior' due to the explicit suicidal intent coupled with a specific, detailed plan.

I put a stop to it again and again but everytime something got hard with my family I kept running to the other woman for support. I knew it was wrong and I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much. We were together for two years. But she found out about the previous incident and left. I am fully responsible for everything that happened.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        - ""my mum is dying from cancer"" (contextual, not self-inflicted).
        - ""I've struggled with suicide before."" (Direct mention of suicide).
        - ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" (Implies a past serious suicidal crisis, but doesn't describe the *action* taken).
        - ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well."" (Clear expression of a desire to die by suicide, linked to a future event).
        - ""im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing"" (Implies future self-inflicted death).
    - Emotional indicators: ""horrible thing,"" ""hated myself so much,"" ""hate myself so much,"" ""regretful,"" ""sorry for hurting her,"" ""dont know how to process any of it,"" ""dont see any future ahead for me,"" ""so scared."" (Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, regret).
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or immediate timeframe for *current* suicide. ""once my mum passes"" is a conditional future event, not a concrete plan with a method or specific timing for an action.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""I've struggled with suicide before"" and ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" While ""hospitalised for it"" indicates a severe past event, the post *does not describe the specific concrete action* the poster took (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). The definition for 'Attempt' requires a description of ""what the person *did*."" Being hospitalized is a consequence, not the action itself.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" (""I've struggled with suicide before"") and clear, unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or cease existing (""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well,"" ""im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing,"" ""I dont see any future ahead for me""). This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal intent (from Step 2).
    - Does it mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump"")? No.
    - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
    - Specific location? No.
    - Specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? ""once my mum passes"" is a conditional future event, not a specific, actionable timeframe for a *plan* (like ""tonight"" or ""on my birthday""). It's a feared outcome, not a planned action.
    - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Therefore, there is no explicit plan for *current* suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life?
    - ""I've struggled with suicide before"" is vague.
    - ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" While this indicates a severe past suicidal crisis, it does not describe the *specific concrete action* the poster took (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I cut myself""). The definition for 'Attempt' explicitly states, ""A concrete action (what the person *did*) must be described."" Being hospitalized is a consequence, not the described action itself. Therefore, this does not meet the strict criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there are explicit suicide mentions and a clear desire to die.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe for current action, or preparation).
    - It's not 'Attempt' because, despite references to past struggles and hospitalization, it does not describe a *specific past concrete action* taken to end their life.
    - It fits 'Ideation' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""struggled with suicide,"" ""joining her as well,"" ""my passing"") and a clear desire to not be alive any longer (""I dont see any future ahead for me,"" ""I will be joining her as well""), but without any specific plan or described past concrete action.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I wake up even more tired of living"" clearly indicates a desire not to continue living. ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" strongly implies ending one's life to stop the suffering, and also suggests an urgent timeframe.
    - Emotional indicators: ""My mind is hell,"" ""losing,"" ""painful,"" ""Nothing, nothing changes,"" ""tear me down,"" ""stupid for falling this low,"" ""weak,"" ""hopeless."" These indicate severe emotional distress, despair, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans: No explicit method, means, location, or preparations are mentioned. However, ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" implies a specific, urgent timeframe for an action to cease living. This fits the ""specific timeframe"" criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete suicide attempts are described. The mention of trying Prozac and other coping mechanisms are not attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used.
    - However, ""I wake up even more tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or cease existing.
    - Therefore, yes, there is a clear desire to die. This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation?
        - ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" This phrase indicates a specific, urgent, and limited timeframe for the intended action. While not a precise date, it conveys immediacy and a decision to act soon, which aligns with the ""specific timeframe"" element of a plan.
    - Yes, the implied urgent timeframe (""I don't have much time left"") suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's a clear desire to die/not be alive.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no specific past concrete action is described.
    - It expresses a clear desire to die (""tired of living,"" ""have to stop it"").
    - Crucially, it includes an element of a plan: a specific, urgent timeframe (""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it""). This moves it beyond mere ideation to 'Behavior' according to the definition.

This directly aligns with the 'Behavior' definition: ""A plan MUST include one or more of the following: ...specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent... mention of specific tools/weapons... or substances (e.g., lethal medication/drugs) with clear intent for suicide"".

It hurts.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die,"" ""I'm tired of being alive.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""depressed,"" ""miserable,"" ""stuck,"" ""no way out,"" ""resent me,"" ""It hurts."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and emotional pain.
    - Specific plans: No mention of method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post does not use ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" directly.
    - However, it contains direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die and not be alive: ""I want to die,"" ""I'm tired of being alive.""
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die expressed. This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a desire to die, but it does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means being acquired (e.g., ""bought a gun""), a specific location (e.g., ""that bridge""), a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or clear preparations (e.g., ""writing notes,"" ""giving things away"").
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life (e.g., ""I overdosed last year""). It describes current feelings and circumstances.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I'm tired of being alive""). This means it is beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I tried with a knife,"" ""I have to do it,"" ""I should've done it a long time ago,"" ""I want this to end.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I hate myself so much,"" ""I am scared.""
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method/Means:** ""I have a rope."" (Indicates a current means for a potential method).
        *   **Location:** ""There's a building..."" (Indicates a considered location).
        *   **Timeframes:** No specific timeframe mentioned.
        *   **Preparations:** No explicit preparations.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This is a clear description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, there are unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/cease existing: ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have to do it,"" ""I want this to end."" (So, not 'Indicator').

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post mentions elements of a current plan: ""I have a rope"" (means/method) and ""There's a building"" (location). This would lean towards 'Behavior' if there were no past attempt.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly describes a specific past concrete action: ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This statement describes what the poster *did* in the past to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die and mentions current planning elements (""I have a rope,"" ""There's a building""). This would typically fall under 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the post also contains a clear description of a *specific past concrete action* taken to attempt suicide: ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work.""
    *   According to the 'Attempt' definition: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'.""
    *   Since both a past concrete attempt and current planning/ideation are present, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification as per the guidelines.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just want to end it"" (implies ending life/existence).
    - Emotional indicators: ""Tired of it,"" ""No point to anything in life with depression,"" ""I feel pain,"" ""so useless,"" ""most useless pos known to mankind,"" ""A fly is worth more than i am."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and severe distress.
    - Specific plans: None. No method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. ""I just want to end it"" in the context of extreme self-deprecation, pain, and hopelessness clearly expresses a desire to cease existing or end their life.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die/end existence, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location being considered? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There are no elements of a specific plan. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There is no description of what they *did*.
    - Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to ""end it"" (meaning to end their life/suffering/existence), which aligns with the 'Ideation' definition: ""a clear desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., 'I want it to be over', 'I want it to end')"".
    - It does not contain any specific plan elements (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - It expresses more than just general distress; it expresses a clear desire to ""end it,"" distinguishing it from 'Indicator'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

363,"Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow. But I will, as always. Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again. Tired of being alone.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" (clear desire to die/not be alive). ""attempt properly again"" (direct reference to a past suicide attempt and a potential future one).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depressed enough,"" ""Tired of being alone"" (despair, loneliness, hopelessness).
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method, means, location, or timeframe for a *current* plan. The mention of ""Christmas probably won't be happening... that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"" describes a *conditional future trigger* for an attempt, but not a concrete plan with specifics (method, means, time, location).
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""attempt properly again"" indicates a past attempt. However, the definition for 'Attempt' requires a description of a ""specific past concrete action"" (what the person *did*). ""attempt properly again"" is a vague reference to a past attempt without detailing the action itself (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). Therefore, it does not meet the strict criteria for 'Attempt'.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" is a clear desire to not be alive.
    *   Yes, ""attempt properly again"" explicitly refers to suicide attempts.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    *   Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe for a *current* act, or preparations? No. The future attempt is conditional and lacks any specific details of a plan.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life?
    *   The phrase ""attempt properly again"" indicates a past attempt. However, the definition clearly states: ""Vague references (e.g., 'I've tried before,' 'my past attempts,' 'I've been suicidal for years and almost did it') without describing the actual action are NOT sufficient for 'Attempt'."" The phrase ""attempt properly again"" falls into this category of vague references without describing *what* the person did.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the strict criteria for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there's a clear desire to die and explicit reference to suicide attempts.
    *   It's not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe for a *current* act, or preparations).
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because, while it refers to a past attempt, it does not describe a specific concrete action taken, as required by the definition.
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"") and suicidal thoughts/history (""attempt properly again"" implies a history of suicidal ideation and actions, even if the action isn't detailed). This fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me,"" ""chop me up,"" ""never get found again."" These are direct expressions of a desire to die and cease to exist through external means, which is a form of suicidal ideation/intent.
    *   Emotional indicators: The desperate plea and specific instructions imply extreme distress and a desire to escape.
    *   Specific plans:
        *   Method: ""kill me,"" ""chop me up"" – this is a specific, albeit unusual, method of death being sought.
        *   Means: The poster is looking for ""someone to kill me,"" indicating a search for means (another person) to carry out the act.
        *   Location: Not specified.
        *   Timeframe: Not specified.
        *   Preparations: ""hide my body so that my family will never find out"" – this is a clear instruction/preparation for the aftermath of the desired act.
    *   Past concrete actions: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill me"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I am happy for u to chop me up as long as i never get found again"" clearly expresses a desire to cease existing and be undiscoverable.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method** for suicide: Yes, ""kill me"" and ""chop me up"" describe a method of death.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: The poster is actively ""looking for someone to kill me,"" which is seeking means (another person) with suicidal intent.
        *   A specific **location** being considered for suicide: No.
        *   A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide: No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: Yes, ""hide my body so that my family will never find out"" is a specific instruction related to the desired outcome and aftermath, fitting the definition of preparation.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die and mentions of a specific method and preparation, this falls under 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No, the post describes a current desire and plan, not a past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to die (""kill me""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by specifying a method (""kill me,"" ""chop me up"") and a clear preparation/instruction for the aftermath (""hide my body so that my family will never find out""). These elements meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death,"" ""some days I consider it [suicide]"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""fed up,"" ""fighting down,"" ""rock bottom lows,"" ""no desire to die"" (but this is immediately qualified by considering suicide due to being fed up). The primary emotion is exhaustion from fighting suicidal thoughts.
    - Specific plans: None mentioned (no method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations).
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None. The post mentions fighting thoughts for 10 years, but no actions taken.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" and ""consider it"" in the context of ending the struggle.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? ""fantasizing about my death."" While the post states ""I have no desire to die,"" this is immediately followed by ""But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it."" The presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death"" indicates a clear presence of suicidal ideation, even if the primary driver is exhaustion rather than a direct desire for death itself.
    - Conclusion for Step 2: Yes, explicit suicide terms and expressions of fantasizing about death are present. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method for suicide? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location being considered for suicide? No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No.

    - Conclusion for Step 3: No elements of a specific plan are present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post refers to fighting thoughts for 10 years, but not a concrete action taken.
    - Conclusion for Step 4: No past attempt is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because it contains explicit ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death,"" and the poster ""consider[s] it"" (suicide). This goes beyond general distress.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned. The phrase ""some days I consider it"" indicates a thought or contemplation, not a formulated plan.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no specific past concrete action to end their life is described.
    - The post clearly describes the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death,"" and the consideration of suicide, without any specific plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""wish to end my life"", ""end all this"", ""can't harm myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""problems are getting worse"", ""struggling more and more"", ""depressed"", ""scared"", ""unimportant"", ""sad"", ""envious"", ""no more options"".
    - Specific plans: None mentioned. The post explicitly states ""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest. I don't know why, but I just. can't."" which negates the presence of a plan or ability to act on one.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""I just really wish to end my life"" and ""I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this."" These are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - No. The post explicitly states, ""The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest. I don't know why, but I just. can't."" This indicates an *inability* to act, not the presence of a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation).

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No. The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. The statement about not being able to harm themselves refers to a current state, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, there is a clear desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 3, there is no specific plan mentioned; in fact, the poster states an inability to harm themselves. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete action to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear desire to not be alive any longer (""wish to end my life,"" ""end all this"") but explicitly states the absence of any ability to act on it, thus lacking a plan.

    - Emotional indicators: ""I lost control,"" ""I've lost control of my head,"" ""I just want to cry,"" ""I can't breathe,"" ""I want to scream help please,"" ""I don't want to live this again."" These indicate extreme distress, overwhelm, and a desire for the current suffering to cease.
    - Specific plans: No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: No.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? The phrase ""I don't want to live this again,"" especially in the context of severe distress (""lost control,"" ""can't breathe,"" ""scream help""), is a clear and unambiguous expression of not wanting to continue living in the current state of suffering. This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition's examples like ""I want it to be over"" or ""I wish I could disappear,"" indicating a desire to not be alive any longer in this painful condition. Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Therefore, no elements of a plan are present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, there is a clear desire not to be alive (""I don't want to live this again"" in a context of severe distress), which means it's more than 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 3, there is no specific plan mentioned.
    - Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete action.
    - The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., 'I want to die,' 'I hate living,' 'I wish I could disappear,' 'I want it to be over,' 'I'm going to die soon' when in a context of distress), but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" fits the ""clear desire to not be alive any longer"" aspect, and there is no plan. This aligns perfectly with the 'Ideation' category.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""too hard,"" ""horrible,"" ""tired,"" ""sickness I've been carrying,"" ""trauma.""
    *   **Specific plans:** The phrase ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it"" is a strong indicator of preparation for suicide (a suicide note).
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. The note is presented as a current preparation for a current decision, not a past failed attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains ""my reason to die"" and ""I decided this is it,"" which are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/end one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post mentions ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" According to the 'Behavior' definition, ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent (e.g., 'I've written a suicide note')"" is a criterion for 'Behavior'. Leaving a suicide note is a clear sign of preparation.
    *   Even though a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or timeframe isn't explicitly stated, the act of writing and leaving a suicide note is a concrete preparation for suicide, fitting the 'Behavior' definition.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. The note is presented as a current preparation for a current decision, not a recounting of a past failed attempt.

369,"All i want is to be normal. I wish I'd been born neurotypical. Had ADHD all my life. They used to say it goes away at puberty, but they were wrong. It gets worse. Much worse. It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore. What's the point of life when you can't even carry your own weight? I just want to be normal. How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states: ""I screamed that I wanted to die,"" ""fired for being suicidal,"" ""I just. Want. To die,"" and ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, self-blame, loneliness, despair, and a sense of being a burden. Phrases like ""unstable freak,"" ""creep,"" ""I don't deserve anything,"" ""I can't keep doing this anymore,"" ""What's the point of life when you can't even carry your own weight?"" are present.
    *   **Specific plans:** The question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" is a direct inquiry about a *method* for suicide, with a specific criterion (not leaving a body). This indicates active consideration and seeking of a method, which is a component of a plan.
    *   **Preparations:** None explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The post mentions ""Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die"" and ""I was fired for being suicidal,"" but these are expressions of ideation or a state of being, not descriptions of a concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal,"" ""want to die,"" and ""kill myself."" This confirms the presence of suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post asks: ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" This is a direct question seeking a *method* for suicide that meets a specific condition. While not stating ""I *will* use X method,"" it is an active inquiry into *how* to carry out the act, which constitutes a planning element related to the method. It goes beyond mere ideation by actively seeking information on execution.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. References to ""screamed that I wanted to die"" or being ""fired for being suicidal"" are not descriptions of concrete actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Based on Step 2, the post contains explicit suicidal intent and a clear desire to die, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete suicide attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   We must differentiate between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' involves suicidal thoughts/desire without a specific plan. 'Behavior' involves suicidal thoughts/desire *with* a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations).
    *   The phrase ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" is a clear indication of seeking a specific *method* for suicide, even if the method itself isn't chosen yet. This active consideration of *how* to commit suicide, with a specific constraint, moves it beyond mere ideation into the realm of planning, which falls under the 'Behavior' definition (specifically, seeking a method).

I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy.

One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""No point in it all,"" ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""I wasn't meant for this world,"" ""I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" These phrases strongly imply a desire to end life.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""No point in it all,"" ""won't get anywhere,"" ""don't see a future""), despair (""trapped in limbo,"" ""view...dim,"" ""sick""), worthlessness (""people are starting to lose hope in me (as they should),"" ""keep disappointing those who care""), anhedonia (""none of it made me truly happy,"" ""Everything here is lame"").
    - Specific plans: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., ""I have the pills""), location (e.g., ""that bridge""), specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or preparations (e.g., ""writing notes""). ""One last push"" is metaphorical for the final action, not a concrete plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes. Phrases like ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""I wasn't meant for this world,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" are clear and unambiguous expressions of a desire to die and cease existing, implying self-inflicted action.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die expressed, the post is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No. (""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" implies hastening death, but not a *specific* time like ""tonight"" or ""on my birthday"").
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since no elements of a specific plan are present, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There is no mention of ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists,"" or similar descriptions of what they *did*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear and unambiguous desire to die and end life (""One last push...free from it all...eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There are no specific details of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear desire to not be alive any longer without a specific plan.

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""commit suicide"" is used, but in a general context, referring to ""People who commit suicide,"" not the poster themselves.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""painful emotions,"" ""snap and break down"" are mentioned, but again, in a general sense (""we've bottled everything up"" referring to a general human experience, not a direct statement of the poster's current state leading to suicide).
    *   Specific plans: None.
    *   Past concrete actions: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""commit suicide"" is mentioned.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post discusses the *reasons* why people might commit suicide, but it does not express the poster's personal desire to die or end their life. The ""we"" in ""we've bottled everything up"" is a generalized ""we"" referring to people who might reach that point, not a statement of the poster's current suicidal intent.
    *   Since there is no clear desire to die *expressed by the poster about themselves*, despite the general mention of ""suicide,"" it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' or higher. The presence of the word ""suicide"" in a general, non-personal context (i.e., not ""I will commit suicide"" or ""I want to commit suicide"") does not automatically elevate it beyond 'Indicator' if there's no personal intent or desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):** Not applicable, as there is no personal suicidal intent expressed.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:** Not applicable, as no past concrete action is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses the topic of suicide and the emotional processes that can lead to it, showing empathy and understanding (""People who commit suicide are not weak."").
    *   However, it does not contain any explicit expression of the *poster's own* suicidal thoughts or feelings, nor a clear desire for the poster to not be alive. The discussion is general and observational.
    *   It fits the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life."" While the word ""suicide"" is present, it's not an expression *concerning suicide by the poster about themselves*. There is no clear desire to die or intent to self-harm expressed by the individual writing the post.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""If I kill myself"", ""leave this world forever"", ""I'd be dead"". These are direct expressions of suicidal intent and death.
    - Emotional indicators: Anger, resentment, defiance (""fuck everyone I knew"", ""I don't owe anybody shit"", ""giant middle finger"").
    - Specific plans: No mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., ""I have the pills""), location (e.g., ""that bridge""), specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"", ""at 21""), or preparations (e.g., ""writing notes""). The phrase ""before I leave this world forever"" indicates a desire to die but not a specific timeframe for the act itself.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""If I kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever"", which are clear expressions of wanting to die. This confirms it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die, but it does not mention a specific method, specific means, specific location, specific timeframe for the act itself (beyond the general ""before I leave this world forever""), or clear signs of preparation. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. It is hypothetical (""If I kill myself"") and focused on current feelings/intentions regarding others after death, not a past action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""If I kill myself"", ""leave this world forever"") and a clear desire to die.
    - It does not contain any specific elements of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, preparation).
    - It does not describe a past concrete attempt.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live."" - Expresses a strong desire not to live.
        *   ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" - A direct statement of future death, in a context of severe distress and inability to function, implying a desire to cease existing.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of having to live,"" ""frustrated,"" ""demoralising,"" ""fucked up majorly,"" ""constant feeling of dread and anxiety,"" ""I hate it,"" ""horrible,"" ""feel nothing anymore,"" ""can't motivate myself,"" ""can't fucking function in this world,"" ""constant state of anxiety and/or depression."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), means (e.g., ""bought a gun,"" ""have the pills ready""), location (e.g., ""that bridge""), or preparations (e.g., ""writing notes,"" ""giving things away"") are mentioned. The phrase ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"" is a projection of a future state of hopelessness, not a specific timeframe for *carrying out* a suicidal act (like ""tonight"" or ""on my birthday"").
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide (e.g., ""I overdosed last year,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life.""
    *   However, there are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live"" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" These phrases, especially in the context of profound distress, clearly indicate a desire to cease existing.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die/not be alive, the post is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on the presence of suicidal intent (from Step 2), I checked for specific elements of a plan:
        *   Method: No.
        *   Means: No.
        *   Location: No.
        *   Timeframe for the act: ""In five years? Dead"" is a statement of future hopelessness, not a plan to *execute* suicide within that timeframe. It does not meet the specificity required (e.g., ""I'm doing it tonight,"" ""I plan to do it on my birthday"").
        *   Preparation: No.
    *   Since no specific elements of a plan are present, it does not classify as 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire not to live and a projection of future death (""tired of having to live,"" ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe for the act, or preparations) required for 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete suicide attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""kill their self"" is a direct mention of suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""end their pain"" suggests distress and a desire for cessation of suffering.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The post is framed as a question (""If someone wants to kill their self... why do people stop them?"").
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""kill their self."" This clearly indicates suicidal intent or thoughts, even if framed as a hypothetical question, especially with the added ""Asking for a personal reason."" This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post does not mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide. It is a general, philosophical question about intervention, not a statement of intent with a plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken by the poster to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""kill their self"" and hints at personal relevance (""Asking for a personal reason"") and distress (""end their pain""). This goes beyond general distress and indicates suicidal thoughts or a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal"", ""jumping in and drowning"" (past thought/plan), ""suicide by a train is on my mind"", ""kill me"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""depressed"", ""faking everything I do"".
    - Specific plans: ""suicide by a train is on my mind"", ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"", ""put neck on the train tracks"". This includes a specific method (train), a specific timeframe (18th birthday), and a specific location/means (train tracks).
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: The mention of the lake (""I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning... So some how she convince me not to."") describes a past *intention* or *plan* that was *interrupted* before a concrete action (like jumping in) was taken. It does not describe a completed action or an action that was initiated and failed. Therefore, it does not meet the definition of a 'concrete action' for 'Attempt'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal"", ""suicide by a train is on my mind"", and a clear desire to die (""will it instantly kill me"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, building on step 2, the post mentions:
        - A specific method: ""suicide by a train"", ""put neck on the train tracks"".
        - A specific timeframe: ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"".
        - A specific location: ""train tracks"".
    - These elements strongly indicate 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post describes a past event at the lake where the poster *thought* about jumping and was *convinced not to*. This means a concrete action (jumping in) was *not* taken. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life."" Since the action was prevented, it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation and a clear desire to die, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a specific plan with a method (""train""), timeframe (""18th birthday""), and location (""train tracks""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - The past event described (running to the lake, thinking of drowning, but being convinced not to) does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' because no concrete action was taken. The action was interrupted.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""tried to end his life"" (referring to someone else), ""keep thinking about it,"" ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""rougher weeks,"" ""can't really explain why I feel like this,"" ""just don't want to think like this anymore.""
    - Specific plans: None mentioned (no method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations).
    - Past concrete actions: The post mentions ""I've had some suicidal thoughts through my life,"" which refers to past *thoughts*, not past *concrete actions* taken by the poster. It also mentions someone *else's* attempt, which is not relevant for classifying the poster's risk.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? The phrase ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try"" in the context of someone else's suicide attempt, combined with ""I keep thinking about it,"" indicates a current, active consideration of suicide for the poster.
    - Since there are explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and a clear implication of current suicidal ideation, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - There are no elements of a specific plan present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post mentions ""I've had some suicidal thoughts through my life,"" which refers to thoughts, not actions. The mention of an attempt is about someone else.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and indicates a current mental engagement with the idea of suicide (""keep thinking about it,"" ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There are no specific plan elements (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action taken by the poster to attempt suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a clear desire to not be alive (implied by ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try"" in context) but without a specific plan.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""just want my life to end"" is a clear expression of a desire to die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""can't even do work, be productive, stay hydrated without having intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions, rage outbursts, followed by depressive episodes"" indicates significant distress, functional impairment, and depressive symptoms.
    - Specific plans: No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"".
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""just want my life to end"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die/cease existing.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): Yes, ""just want my life to end"".
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: No.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - Since there are no elements of a plan, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""just want my life to end""). This means it is not 'Indicator'.
    - It does not contain any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a specific past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category as it expresses a clear desire to not be alive any longer without a specific plan.

378,"not sure what to call this-. i don't know how to describe it, but it feels like i disassociate sometimes. granted, it could just be adhd stuff along with a part of my extreme dysphoria and never feeling like i'm the person i appear as; but, it doesn't feel like i'm in my body. like i'm simply watching someone work and live while i only watch. when others call for me or start conversations, it's like i'm not a part of it. i can't fully think when i talk or write, like i act without my own permission. i feel so disconnected from life in itself already, to the point where my emotions never act how i want. even when it came to serious topics such as my dog's passing or nearly killing myself one night, i don't feel really anything for it. i just sit there and watch people express themselves, not knowing what to do. when i see others sad or stressed, i can't feel the same or help. everything seems so far out of my touch, like it's not even real at some times. i can write things down or do something earlier that day, only to feel as if it were fake or like i wasn't actually doing it/there. this doesn't held that i lucid dream so often that, when i wake back up, real life feels more as a dream than my actual dreams. i zone out fairly often to the point of not realizing where i am or what i was doing prior. i want to talk to a therapist about it, but i have no money nor insurance to talk to one. not like i'd even trust a therapist fully with how trashy past ones have treated me. and i've already caused enough trouble for my parents. all i can do is watch days pass by without me even realizing it. dealing with constant bad moods from my dad, to the point where he throws things at times, and barely seeing my mom as she works. it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""nearly killing myself one night."" It also mentions a future possibility: ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""disassociate,"" ""extreme dysphoria,"" ""never feeling like i'm the person i appear as,"" ""disconnected from life,"" ""emotions never act how i want,"" ""can't feel the same or help,"" ""everything seems so far out of my touch,"" ""constant bad moods,"" ""caused enough trouble for my parents."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, anhedonia, and worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans:** ""step off a building or over a bridge"" mentions a specific method (jumping) and specific locations (a building, a bridge). While ""without thinking"" implies impulsivity, the method and location are clear elements of a plan.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:** ""nearly killing myself one night"" describes a past concrete action. It's not vague; it points to a specific event where the user came very close to ending their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, ""nearly killing myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
    *   Yes, ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" expresses a clear desire to die/end life.
    *   Conclusion: Not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post mentions a specific method (""step off a building or over a bridge"") and specific locations (a building, a bridge). This clearly indicates a plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The phrase ""nearly killing myself one night"" describes a specific past concrete action the poster took (or very nearly took) to try to end their life. This fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains elements that would qualify it as 'Behavior' (current plan with method/location).
    *   Crucially, it also contains a description of a specific past concrete action: ""nearly killing myself one night.""
    *   The 'Attempt' definition states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'.""
    *   Therefore, because a specific past concrete action is described, and current plans are also mentioned, the classification is 'Attempt'.

    - Emotional indicators: ""killed my mental health"", ""lazy"", ""useless"", ""failure"", ""disappointment"", ""coward"", ""burnout"", ""so tired of expectations"", ""scared of the consequences of failure"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
    - Specific plans: The user states ""for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way."" This explicitly states that a method has *not* been found, meaning no specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation is mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""thinking on how to die painlessly"" and ""I want to die,"" which are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. It mentions ""contemplating"" but not a past action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Must end this shit show,"" ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it,"" ""So many people commit suicide,"" ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop,"" ""I'm very OVER this shit.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hatred (""I hate my parents,"" ""I hate the doctor,"" ""I hate the bad memories,"" ""I hate every single day,"" ""I literally hate everything,"" ""I hate who I am living with,"" ""I hate everything and everyone,"" ""I fucking hate""), hopelessness (""lack of future,"" ""My life is ruined,"" ""I have nothing""), despair (""I'm very OVER this shit"").
    *   **Specific plans:** The phrase ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it"" clearly indicates preparation for suicide (writing a suicide note/email).
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop"" describes past ideation, not a specific past concrete action/attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes. The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""killing myself."" It also has clear expressions of wanting to end life (""Must end this shit show,"" ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it,"" ""I'm very OVER this shit""). This confirms it is beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**? No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging) is mentioned.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent? Yes, ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it"" clearly indicates preparation by composing suicide notes/emails. This falls under ""means being acquired or possessed with intent"" or ""preparations"" as per the 'Behavior' definition (e.g., ""I've written a suicide note"").
        *   A specific **location**? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**? No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned, only ""before I do it.""
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? Yes, writing emails to send before the act is a clear sign of preparation.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal intent and a specific element of preparation (writing suicide-related emails), this points to 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No. The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop"" describes ongoing ideation, not a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions and clear desire to die.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.
    *   It's more than 'Ideation' because, in addition to strong suicidal thoughts (""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop,"" ""I want to end this shit show""), there is a clear mention of a specific *preparation* for suicide: ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This element of preparation, akin to writing a suicide note, fits the 'Behavior' definition (""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent"" or ""preparations"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Ending it soon"" (clear intent to end life).
    - Emotional indicators: ""so fucking depressed,"" ""scared,"" ""fucked me up for good.""
    - Specific plans: ""ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here."" This specifies a method (taking the substance), means (the substance itself, being acquired), and a timeframe (""as soon as it gets here"").
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, ""Ending it soon"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method? Yes, ""taking it all"" (referring to the dextromethorphan).
    - Does it mention specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? Yes, ""ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here."" This clearly describes acquiring a specific substance with suicidal intent.
    - Does it mention a specific timeframe? Yes, ""as soon as it gets here.""
    - Does it mention specific tools/weapons/substances with clear intent for suicide? Yes, ""14 grams of dextromethorphan.""
    - Since multiple elements of a plan (method, means, specific substance, and timeframe) are present, this fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It describes a future plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to end one's life (""Ending it soon""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It explicitly details a plan, including a specific substance (dextromethorphan), the acquisition of that substance (""ordered... in the mail""), the intent to use it all, and a timeframe (""as soon as it gets here""). These elements align perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior' (specific method, means, timeframe, specific substance).
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post questions ""how people can want to live?"" and ""how they actually find important to stay alive?"". It discusses the concept of dying around 80 and the remaining years of life. This is a philosophical rumination on life's value and duration, rather than direct mentions of suicide or self-harm.
    - Emotional indicators: The tone expresses cynicism and dissatisfaction with the idea of living a long life (""it wasn't really good"", ""60 fucking years left""). It implies a lack of perceived value in continuing to live for a long period.
    - Specific plans: There are no mentions of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes for suicide (the ""at 21"" refers to current age, not a planned age for suicide), or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: No descriptions of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post questions *why others* would want to live and expresses a personal lack of enthusiasm for living a long life, but it does not state ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" or ""I want it all to end."" It's a rhetorical questioning of the value of life, not a direct statement of suicidal intent or desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die, this step is not applicable for classifying as 'Behavior'. There are no elements of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe for suicide, or preparation) mentioned.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general dissatisfaction with life and questions the desire to live, particularly for a long time. It mentions ""it wasn't really good"" referring to past life experience.
    - It does NOT contain explicit suicidal language or a clear, unambiguous desire to die. The questioning of ""how people can want to live?"" is a philosophical query, not a statement of personal desire to die.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan for suicide.
    - There is no description of a past concrete suicide attempt.
    - Based on the definitions, the post fits the 'Indicator' category, which describes content lacking explicit suicide expression or a clear desire to die, but may include general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""passive suicidal,"" ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal,"" and ""suicide by cop.""
    - Emotional indicators: The post expresses concern or frustration about how people might inadvertently encourage ""suicide by cop"" in someone who is ""passive suicidal."" This indicates a general awareness and perhaps empathy for suicidal individuals, but not necessarily the poster's own distress or suicidal intent.
    - Specific plans: No specific plans are mentioned by the poster for themselves. The ""suicide by cop"" is a hypothetical scenario involving ""someone who's passive suicidal.""
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None are mentioned by the poster for themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal"" and ""suicide by cop"" are used.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No.
    - Crucially, the rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned."" In this post, the mentions of ""suicidal"" refer to a *hypothetical person* (""someone who's passive suicidal"") and a *hypothetical action* (""suicide by cop""). The poster is discussing a general concept or warning, not expressing their own suicidal thoughts or desire to die. Therefore, despite the presence of the word ""suicidal,"" there is no explicit expression of *the poster's own* suicidal intent or desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior): Not applicable, as the post does not express the poster's own suicidal intent or desire to die.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION: Not applicable, as the post does not describe any past concrete actions taken by the poster to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains the word ""suicidal"" but it is used in a discussion about a hypothetical situation involving *other people*, not as an expression of the poster's own state.
    - There is no clear desire to die or end one's life expressed by the poster.
    - There are no specific plans, methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations mentioned by the poster for themselves.
    - There are no descriptions of past concrete actions taken by the poster to attempt suicide.
    - The post is a commentary on a social dynamic related to suicide, rather than a personal expression of suicidal ideation or behavior.
    - According to the definitions, 'Indicator' is for posts that ""lack any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life"" *from the poster*. Since the poster is discussing a general concept and not their own suicidal state, this fits 'Indicator'.

        *   **Method:** Overdosing on insulin using an insulin pump (""with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go"").
        *   **Means:** Insulin pens (already has access) and an insulin pump (potential future access). ""My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens."" ""Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump... with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go.""
        *   **Location:** Not specified.
        *   **Specific timeframes:** Conditional timeframe: ""if it turns out I do [have Type 1 Diabetes],"" ""if my condition goes south quick."" This is a future conditional plan.
        *   **Preparations:** None explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens"" is ambiguous and doesn't clearly describe a concrete action taken *to attempt suicide*. It could be a near-miss or contemplation. ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up"" explicitly states no action was taken.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   However, the phrases ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" (in context of using insulin to die) and ""Had a couple ideas for how to do it"" clearly express a desire to die and intent to end their life. So, yes, there is a clear desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post mentions a specific **method** (insulin overdose via pump) and **means** (insulin pump/pens) with clear suicidal intent. The post explicitly states ""Had a plan in mind ever since"" and then details this plan. It also mentions a conditional **timeframe** (""if my condition goes south quick"").
    *   Since a specific method and means are described as part of a plan, this fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""almost went into shock"" is not a concrete action taken *to attempt suicide* as defined, and ""didn't because it was such a hassle"" explicitly states no action was taken.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear desire to die and expressions of suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by detailing a specific plan, including a method (insulin overdose), means (insulin pump/pens), and a conditional timeframe. This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action that constitutes an 'Attempt'.

Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly asks ""ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday?"" and then states ""well I do"". This is a direct mention of suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""☹️"", ""nobody told me happy birthday or anything . they just walked past me like I was nothing"", ""tired of everything"", ""Worst birthday ever !"". These indicate severe distress, feelings of worthlessness, neglect, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans:** ""I have a chance right now."" This indicates a current opportunity or means is available, and combined with ""on your birthday"" and ""right now"", it points to a specific timeframe and immediate intent.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""kill yourself"" and a clear statement of wanting to do so (""well I do"").
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    *   Does the post also mention elements of a plan?
        *   **Specific method:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned.
        *   **Specific means:** No specific means (e.g., ""I have the pills ready"") are explicitly stated, but ""I have a chance right now"" strongly implies that the means or opportunity are present and available.
        *   **Specific location:** No specific location is mentioned.
        *   **Specific timeframe:** Yes, ""on your birthday"" and ""right now"" are very specific and immediate timeframes for the act. The definition for 'Behavior' includes ""a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., 'I'm ending it tonight', 'I plan to do it on my birthday')"". The post directly aligns with ""on your birthday"" and adds immediacy with ""right now"".
        *   **Clear signs of preparation:** No explicit preparations are mentioned.
    *   The combination of a clear desire to die, a specific timeframe (""on your birthday"", ""right now""), and the statement ""I have a chance right now"" which implies immediate opportunity/means, fulfills the criteria for 'Behavior'. The immediacy and the ""chance"" elevate it beyond mere ideation.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It is focused on current desire and opportunity.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal language and desire to die.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' as no past concrete action is described.
    *   It's 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation' because, in addition to the clear desire to die (""kill myself"", ""I do""), it includes a specific timeframe (""on your birthday"", ""right now"") and implies the availability of means/opportunity (""I have a chance right now""). This goes beyond just thoughts and indicates a present, actionable intent.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide"". It also includes ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit.""
    - Emotional indicators: Stressed, bawling, bad mental health, struggling, crying myself to sleep, terrible, fucked up head, confused, desolate, pathetic, feeling like nothing helps. Expressions of hopelessness (""I don't want to do this anymore,"" ""none of those things help anymore,"" ""this all means nothing"").
    - Specific plans: There is no mention of a specific method, means, location, or timeframe for suicide. The ""2 weeks"" refers to the end of exams, not a suicide timeframe. There are no preparations mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: The post states ""throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it,"" implying no past attempts. There is no description of any past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""I'm finally considering suicide."" This clearly indicates suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post states ""I'm finally considering suicide,"" which is a thought process. It does not mention any specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means being acquired or possessed, a specific location, a specific timeframe for the act itself, or any preparations. Therefore, there is no plan identified.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. In fact, it indicates the opposite by saying they ""never thought about it"" before now.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, the explicit mention of ""considering suicide"" means it is not 'Indicator'.
    - Based on Step 3, the absence of any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) means it is not 'Behavior'.
    - Based on Step 4, the absence of any description of a past concrete action means it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""considering suicide"") and a desire for things to end (""I don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I want it all to end"") without a plan. This perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""attempted to end my life"", ""kill myself"", ""almost committed"", ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"", ""put down my knife"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""shaking and bawling"", ""worst feeling the worst suspense"", ""too much of a pussy"", ""Living life as a shell is bullshit"", ""I couldn't breath"".
    - Specific plans: The post describes an action that was initiated and then interrupted/failed (""My fucking hand wouldn't move. I couldn't breath... then I put down my knife.""). It's a description of a *past* action, not a future plan.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""I just attempted to end my life."" ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"". ""I put down my knife."" ""I almost committed."" These are clear descriptions of a concrete action taken.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""attempted to end my life"" and ""kill myself"". It also expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""Living life as a shell is bullshit"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - While a method (knife) is mentioned, it's in the context of a *just-occurred* action (""I put down my knife""), not a future plan. The primary focus is on what *just happened*.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post describes a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life: ""I just attempted to end my life."" It provides concrete details of this action, including physical evidence (""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"") and the tool used (""put down my knife""). This directly aligns with the 'Attempt' definition.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly states ""I just attempted to end my life"" and provides concrete details of the action taken (""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"", ""put down my knife""). This fits the definition of 'Attempt' perfectly: ""The content describes one or more specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life"". Even though the attempt was interrupted, the action was initiated and described in detail.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

        *   ""I feel like killing myself"" - Direct expression of suicidal thoughts/desire.
        *   ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't"" - Direct expression of suicidal thoughts/desire, with a stated lack of means/courage to act.
        *   ""I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live"" - Expresses a conditional desire to cease living linked to loss of support.
        *   ""I guess I'm dying alone too"" - Passive mention of dying.
        *   ""Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself"" - Mentions suicide, but as an external suggestion, not an internal desire.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""no point to it,"" ""at a dead end,"" ""I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do""), despair, worthlessness (""wanted people to see my worth""), isolation (""haven't had irl friends,"" ""all I have is my family here,"" ""no one to depend on""), severe anxiety, feeling hurt and betrayed by parents.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations. The statement ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't"" explicitly indicates a *lack* of current intention or ability to act on the suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The post explicitly states, ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to."" This clearly indicates no past concrete action was taken.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" and ""killing myself,"" along with clear expressions of wanting to die (""despite wanting to,"" ""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide. In fact, it explicitly states, ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't,"" which indicates a current *lack* of a plan or intent to act. Therefore, this is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to."" This directly contradicts the definition of 'Attempt', which requires a description of a specific past concrete action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (""wanting to [attempt suicide]"", ""I feel like killing myself"", ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations), and the poster explicitly states they lack the ""guts"" to act. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   The poster explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide,"" ruling out 'Attempt'.

392,"""friend"" snitched on me and told family my plan to kill myself. now they're keeping their heads up and watching me. this is like preventing someone to get euthanized. what the fuck.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""my plan to kill myself"" is a direct mention of suicide and a plan. ""preventing someone to get euthanized"" is an indirect reference to ending life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""what the fuck"" indicates frustration and distress.
    - Specific plans: The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself."" While the details of the plan (method, means, location, timeframe) are not *described* in the post, the existence of a plan is clearly stated. The context (""friend snitched,"" ""family watching me"") further implies the seriousness and perceived imminence of this plan.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""kill myself."" This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post states ""my plan to kill myself."" The definition for 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" Even though the specific *details* of the plan are not laid out, the explicit mention of ""my plan"" is sufficient to meet this criterion for 'Behavior'. The surrounding context (friend snitching, family watching) reinforces that a plan exists and is being taken seriously by others.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action taken to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""kill myself"").
    - It explicitly mentions the existence of ""my plan to kill myself."" This goes beyond mere thoughts or a desire to die (Ideation) and indicates a more concrete step towards action, as defined by the 'Behavior' category's inclusion of ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide.""
    - It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

    *   The post mentions a specific timeframe: ""3 weeks from now.""
    *   The post describes clear signs of preparation/withdrawal: ""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children.""
    *   According to the 'Behavior' definition, a plan MUST include one or more of: specific method, means, location, *specific timeframe*, or preparations. The presence of a specific timeframe and preparatory actions clearly indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post describes a future plan, not a specific past concrete action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states suicidal intent (""kill myself"").
    *   It includes a specific timeframe for the act (""3 weeks from now"") and describes preparatory actions (withdrawal from interaction).
    *   These elements align directly with the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes a clear desire to die *and* elements of a plan (timeframe, preparation). It goes beyond mere ideation because of the specificity of the timeframe and the described actions leading up to it.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""Would this kill me"" directly queries the lethal potential of the listed substances, indicating a clear consideration of self-inflicted death.
    - Emotional indicators: Not explicitly stated, but the context implies severe distress and a desire to end life.
    - Specific plans:
        - Methods: Ingesting Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, and alcohol.
        - Means: ""Midol 3 bottles,"" ""Prozac 30 20mg pills,"" ""Tylenol bottle,"" ""Water bottle full of alcohol."" These are specific substances and quantities, implying they are present and being considered for use.
        - Locations: Not specified.
        - Timeframes: Not specified, but the active inquiry suggests immediate or near-future consideration.
        - Preparations: The listing of specific substances and quantities implies they are gathered or ready for use, which constitutes preparation.
    - Past concrete actions: No mention of past actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post asks ""Would this kill me,"" which is a direct and unambiguous expression of considering lethal action and, by extension, a clear desire to die or end one's life by these means. (Yes)

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent is present (from step 2).
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific **method**: Ingesting a combination of specific medications (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol) and alcohol.
        - Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: Yes, ""Midol 3 bottles,"" ""Prozac 30 20mg pills,"" ""Tylenol bottle,"" ""Water bottle full of alcohol."" These are specific substances and quantities, indicating they are available and being considered as tools for suicide.
    - These elements clearly constitute a plan as defined in the 'Behavior' category (specific method and specific tools/substances with clear intent for suicide).

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die/suicidal intent (""Would this kill me""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It explicitly lists specific substances (method and means/tools) that the poster is considering using for suicide. This goes beyond just thoughts or a general desire to die and includes concrete elements of a plan. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

However, recently I've been thinking of doing it in a way that doesn't looks like suicide. Like a car accident or something. I'll get what I want without fucking up anyone's mental health.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""How I'm planning to end it"", ""suicide"", ""doing it in a way that doesn't looks like suicide"", ""Like a car accident or something"", ""I'll get what I want"".
    - Emotional indicators: Clear desire to die, concern for loved ones' mental health, implying severe distress.
    - Specific plans: ""How I'm planning to end it"" indicates a plan. ""Like a car accident or something"" specifies a method for this plan.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide"" and ""end it"".
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I'll get what I want"" in the context of ending life.
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is explicit suicidal intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific **method** for suicide? Yes, ""Like a car accident or something."" This is presented as a specific way to ""end it.""
        - Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific **location** being considered for suicide? No.
        - A specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide? No.
        - Clear signs of **preparation**? No, other than the mention of ""planning"".
    - Conclusion: Yes, a specific method (""car accident or something"") is mentioned as part of the stated plan (""How I'm planning to end it""). This strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""suicide"", ""end it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by explicitly stating ""How I'm planning to end it"" and providing a specific method (""Like a car accident or something""). This fulfills the criteria for 'Behavior' (suicidal intent + specific method).
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in. What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family. Hell I booked driving lesson but me being mentally dumb picked an expensive instructor and all it did was make my sister more stressed than she already was. She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The phrase ""lost cause"" indicates hopelessness, but not suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""complete lost cause,"" ""constantly stuck,"" ""never had any skills that are useful,"" ""family are giving up on me,"" ""constant burden,"" ""never be able to help my mum,"" ""failed miserably,"" ""big fuck up of the family,"" ""mentally dumb,"" ""always going to fail."" These indicate severe hopelessness, worthlessness, despair, and self-blame.
    - Specific plans: No mention of methods, means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: No. The phrase ""Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably"" refers to attempts to fix their life situation (e.g., finding jobs), not suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. While the post expresses extreme distress and hopelessness, it does not explicitly state a desire to die, not be alive, or cease existing. Phrases like ""I'm a complete lost cause"" and ""I'm always going to fail"" indicate a lack of hope and self-worth, but not a direct wish for non-existence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Since there is no explicit desire to die or suicidal intent, this step is not applicable for classifying as 'Behavior'. There are no elements of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation).

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The ""attempts"" mentioned refer to efforts to improve their life circumstances, not suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, there are no explicit suicide terms and no clear desire to die expressed. The post is characterized by general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, and dissatisfaction with life.
    - This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., 'life sucks,' 'I'm so unhappy,' 'I feel worthless,' 'I'm struggling').""
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no clear desire to die or explicit suicidal thoughts expressed.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no plan and no explicit suicidal intent.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as no specific past concrete action of attempting suicide is described.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I feel like shit,"" ""alone and depressed,"" ""fucking sad."" These indicate significant emotional distress, loneliness, and sadness.
    - Specific plans: None. No mention of methods, means, locations, or specific timeframes for suicide. The age ""I'm 21"" is a personal detail, not a timeframe for suicide.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:

No. The post expresses a desire to talk to feel ""a little less alone and depressed,"" implying a desire to *alleviate* distress and continue living, not to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die, this step is not relevant for classifying as 'Behavior'. Even if it were, there are no elements of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, preparation).

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, there are no explicit suicide terms and no clear desire to die.
    - The post expresses general distress (""feel like shit,"" ""sad,"" ""depressed,"" ""alone"") and a need for social connection to cope with these feelings.
    - This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., 'life sucks,' 'I'm so unhappy,' 'I feel worthless,' 'I'm struggling').""

398,"I wrote a note today. I've been struggling with this my whole life. But always I felt that there was some light at the end of the tunnel if only i could just get to it. Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more."" This indicates a consideration of death and a weakening of a deterrent against it.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""struggling,"" ""light has disappeared,"" ""worthless person,"" ""don't know what to do anymore,"" ""at the end of my rope,"" ""at my wits end,"" ""can't keep going like this,"" ""can't continue."" These convey severe distress, hopelessness, and an inability to cope.
    *   **Specific plans/preparations:** ""I wrote a note today."" This is a strong indicator of preparation, typically a suicide note.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital."" This describes a hospitalization for a mental health crisis, but it does *not* explicitly describe a specific concrete action the poster took to try to end their life (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I cut myself""). It describes the *consequence* of distress, not a specific attempt action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit mentions of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   However, there are unambiguous expressions of wanting to cease existing or not be able to continue: ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""lately it feels like I just can't continue,"" ""I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this."" Combined with ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more"" and the act of ""writing a note,"" this clearly indicates a desire to end their life or the severe suffering. Yes, there is a clear desire to die/end suffering.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post mentions ""I wrote a note today."" The definition of 'Behavior' explicitly includes ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent (e.g., 'I've written a suicide note')"" and ""preparations."" Writing a note is a clear preparation for suicide.
    *   Therefore, a specific element of a plan/preparation is identified.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post mentions ending up in the ER and transport to a hospital. However, it does *not* describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). It describes a crisis and subsequent hospitalization, not the *action* of an attempt. Thus, it does not meet the definition for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to end suffering/not continue living (more than 'Indicator').
    *   It includes a specific preparation for suicide (""I wrote a note today""), which falls under the definition of a 'plan' for 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

399,Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Tried to end my life"" is a direct and unambiguous statement of suicidal intent and action.
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied distress, frustration, and a persistent desire to die, given the repetition and failure.
    *   Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, or timeframe for a *future* act is mentioned.
    *   Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" This explicitly describes past actions taken to end their life that were unsuccessful. The phrase ""Tried to end my life"" is a description of a concrete action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, ""end my life"" is an explicit mention.
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die.
    *   Since 'Yes' to both, it's not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post refers to *past* actions (""Tried... didn't work,"" ""Tried... again. Didn't work""). It does not describe a *current or future* plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) for suicide. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post clearly describes specific past concrete actions: ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes one or more **specific past concrete actions** the poster took to try to end their life."" The action described is ""tried to end my life,"" and the outcome ""didn't work"" confirms it was an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states a desire to die (""end my life"") and, crucially, describes past concrete actions taken to achieve this (""Tried... didn't work,"" ""Tried... again""). This perfectly fits the 'Attempt' definition, which focuses on described past concrete actions to end one's life. It is not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond thoughts/desire to describe action. It is not 'Behavior' because it describes past actions, not a current or future plan.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The post focuses entirely on a chronic medical condition and the frustration of not finding a diagnosis or relief.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore."" This indicates significant distress, frustration, and hopelessness related to their ongoing health issues.
    - Specific plans: None. There is no mention of any plan, method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for self-harm or suicide.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: None. The post details a past injury and subsequent medical journey, but no past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrase ""I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore"" expresses extreme frustration and despair with their medical situation, but it does not convey a desire to die or cease existing. It conveys a feeling of being lost and out of options for their health, not a wish to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die, this step is not applicable.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post describes a past physical injury and subsequent medical issues.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness (""I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore""). However, this hopelessness is clearly contextualized within the struggle with a chronic, undiagnosed/untreated medical condition.
    - There are no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, or a desire to die. The language used, while indicative of severe distress, does not cross the threshold into expressing a clear desire to end one's life, which is required for 'Ideation'.
    - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., 'life sucks,' 'I'm so unhappy,' 'I feel worthless,' 'I'm struggling')."" This perfectly aligns with the content of the post. The user is expressing profound distress and hopelessness about their physical symptoms and the lack of effective treatment.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains multiple direct expressions of wanting to die or wishing for death: ""I deserve to die,"" ""I just deserve to be dead,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness (""there is no better, this is it""), worthlessness (""self-absorbed whiny piece of shit,"" ""sad and useless,"" ""fucking monster,"" ""flaming turd,"" ""I know I suck""), and self-loathing.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post explicitly states, ""I have no plans"". While it mentions methods like ""a bullet in my head"" or ""slit my fucking throat,"" these are framed as things the poster *deserves* or wishes *someone else* would do to them, not a plan *they* intend to execute. There are no mentions of means, locations, specific timeframes, or preparations being made by the poster.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No mention of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post does not explicitly use ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" but contains very direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die and cease existing: ""I deserve to die,"" ""I just deserve to be dead,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat."" This clearly indicates a desire to die.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I have no plans"". Although specific methods of death are mentioned (""bullet in my head,"" ""slit my fucking throat""), they are presented as a deserved outcome or a wish for an external force to act, not as a plan the individual themselves is formulating or preparing for. The explicit denial of plans (""I have no plans"") is a critical factor. There are no mentions of acquiring means, specific locations, timeframes, or preparations *by the poster*.
    *   Based on the definition, for 'Behavior', there must be a plan including method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation *by the individual*. The post clearly states the absence of plans.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a strong desire to die and cease existing, using graphic language to describe how they wish this would happen (""I deserve to die,"" ""deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, the post explicitly states, ""I have no plans,"" and the mentions of methods are framed as a deserved fate or an action wished upon by others, not a plan the individual is making or preparing for themselves. This prevents it from being classified as 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete suicide attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation', as it contains explicit expressions of a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I will die alone."" ""But the second they're gone, so am I."" (This is a clear statement of intent to end his life when his parents are gone).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""only alive by obligation,"" ""hideous fucking mutant,"" ""fat retard,"" ""sad man,"" ""sick of this emptiness,"" ""what's the fucking point?"" (hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, self-loathing, anhedonia).
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method, means, location, or preparations are mentioned. However, a specific *conditional timeframe* is given: ""the second they're gone, so am I."" This implies a planned action contingent on that event.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** None described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The phrase ""But the second they're gone, so am I"" is a very direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die by his own hand, contingent on his parents' death. This is a clear desire to cease existing.
    *   Therefore, 'No' to 'Indicator'. Proceed to analyze for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    *   Does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**? No.
        *   Specific **means**? No.
        *   A specific **location**? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**? Yes, ""the second they're gone, so am I."" While conditional, this is a specific future event that serves as a trigger for the intended action, fitting the definition of a ""specific timeframe"" for the act. It's not vague; it's a defined point in time tied to an external event.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? No.
    *   Since a specific (albeit conditional) timeframe for the act is mentioned, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific past concrete action to end their life is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's more than 'Indicator' due to the clear desire to end his life (""the second they're gone, so am I"").
    *   It's not 'Attempt' as no past concrete action is described.
    *   The presence of a clear desire to die combined with a specific, albeit conditional, timeframe for the act (""the second they're gone, so am I"") moves this beyond 'Ideation' into 'Behavior'. The timeframe, though not a fixed date, is a defined condition under which the action is stated to occur, thus functioning as a plan element.

I'm talking to some friends now. not about them or anything, just random stuff. it's helping, but I'm just lying here wondering if I should tell them. every conversation I have with them these days, I'm just thinking ""this might be our last conversation"". during our dnd sessions, I'm thinking it could be my last. then I read this post on tumblr about the aftermath of suicide on people left behind and I started crying. and there's four friends in particular I'd be worried about and I can't help but think about them and hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them and my sibling. and now it's just a guilty downward spiral but I can't do much about it right now, and I don't want to worry any of my friends by telling them how bad it is, like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad. I don't know what I want anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal urges,"" ""self destructive ones,"" ""thinking of killing myself,"" ""aftermath of suicide.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""bad urges,"" ""guilty downward spiral,"" ""don't want to worry any of my friends,"" ""I don't know what I want anymore,"" crying. These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and guilt.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post explicitly states: ""like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" This is a direct admission of having a plan. While a specific date is not set, the existence of ""a plan"" is clearly stated.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal urges"" and ""thinking of killing myself."" This means it's more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    *   The post explicitly states, ""like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" This is a direct statement that the poster *has* a plan. While the specific details (method, means, location) are not provided to *us*, the poster's own admission of having ""a plan"" is sufficient to meet the 'Behavior' definition, which states ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" The lack of a *set date* doesn't negate the existence of *a plan*.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. It talks about past urges but not actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and urges, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The crucial element is the explicit statement: ""like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes posts that ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" The poster directly states they ""have a plan."" Even though the specifics of the plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe) are not detailed *in the post for us*, the admission of *having* a plan is enough to classify it as 'Behavior' according to the provided definitions. The phrase ""no date set"" describes a characteristic of the plan, but not its non-existence.

404,"The questionnaires that include a question asking if I've had suicidal thoughts actually make me less likely to talk about. Because I know it'll cause a massive issue and result in a lot of stress. There going to ask me too many details, and be too insistent with their questioning.

I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts."" It also uses the metaphor ""grave I dug myself,"" which implies a deep, potentially fatal, state of despair or hopelessness.
    - Emotional indicators: ""less likely to talk about,"" ""massive issue and result in a lot of stress,"" ""tough enough as it is,"" ""not sure if I'm strong enough."" These indicate significant distress, avoidance, and feelings of being overwhelmed and lacking strength to cope.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts."" This is a direct reference to suicide.
    - This means the post is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" (indicating suicidal intent/desire to die).
    - However, it does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills""), specific means being acquired (e.g., ""bought a gun""), a specific location (e.g., ""jumping off the bridge""), a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), or clear signs of preparation (e.g., ""writing my note"").
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life (e.g., ""I overdosed last year""). It discusses past *thoughts* but not past *actions*.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts,"" which directly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"")..."").
    - It lacks any specific plan elements required for 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action required for 'Attempt'.
    - It clearly expresses more than just general distress, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - Thus, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""nearly killing myself"", ""I fucking hate living"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""I hate how my ex-friend..."", ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"", ""I fucking hate living"", ""what the fuck did I do wrong?"", ""Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?"". These indicate significant distress, despair, and worthlessness.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" indicates past severe suicidal ideation or being on the brink of an attempt due to bullying. However, it does not describe a *specific concrete action* taken by the poster (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists""). It describes a state or proximity to an action, not the action itself.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""nearly killing myself"".
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I fucking hate living"".
    - Since there are explicit mentions and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method: No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed: No.
        - A specific location: No.
        - A specific timeframe: No.
        - Clear signs of preparation: No.
    - There are no elements of a plan. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" indicates extreme distress and suicidal ideation in the past, possibly being on the verge of an attempt, but it does not describe a *concrete action* that was taken (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). The definition of 'Attempt' requires a description of what they *did*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""nearly killing myself"") and a clear desire to not be alive (""I fucking hate living"").
    - There is no specific plan mentioned (no method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation).
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. ""Nearly killing myself"" is not a description of a concrete action.
    - Therefore, the post best fits the 'Ideation' category as it expresses suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive, without a plan or a described concrete past attempt.

When I sat there and swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle. I definitely feel like my OD was like a *rawrxd* why do I feel like that. Why can't my brain just recognize like I could've died. I wouldn't have (in my brain) I wanted to. . I held off going to the hospital for as long as I could. I don't remember giving consent to go but my boyfriend said I did. Not that I could consent to anything (obv) idk I'm still processing everything and still feel weird even Calling it an OD. Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Survived OD"", ""kill yourself"" (referring to the mother's comment about the attempt), ""OD was like a *rawrxd*"", ""I could've died"", ""I wanted to"" (in the context of dying).
    - Emotional indicators: ""I feel stupid"", ""I feel weird"", ""still processing everything"", ""feel bad asking my boyfriend"".
    - Specific plans: No specific plans for a *future* suicide attempt are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: ""Survived OD."" ""When I sat there and swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle."" This is a very clear and detailed description of a past concrete action to attempt suicide. ""I held off going to the hospital for as long as I could.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains explicit mentions of ""OD"" (overdose, a method of suicide) and ""kill yourself"" (in the context of the mother's comment about the attempt). It also states ""I wanted to"" in the context of dying during the OD.
    - Yes, there is explicit suicidal language and a clear desire to die in the context of the described past event. This means it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post describes a method (""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor"") but this is clearly presented as a *past* action (""When I sat there...""). There is no mention of a *current* or *future* plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post explicitly describes a ""specific past concrete action"" the poster took to try to end their life: ""Survived OD."" and ""When I sat there and swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle."" This perfectly matches the definition for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, and strictly following the definitions, the post clearly describes a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. The phrases ""Survived OD"" and the detailed account of swallowing pills and drinking liquor confirm a past attempt. While there are current feelings and processing, the core of the post is about this past attempt. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most fitting category.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""totally helpless,"" ""misunderstood,"" ""paranoid delusions,"" ""the world is just so rotten to me,"" ""sick of every worthless person around me,"" ""All words are meaningless.

    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past concrete action taken to attempt suicide (e.g., ""I overdosed last year,"" ""I tried to cut myself"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains an explicit mention of ""Suicide has become my quick solution."" This directly indicates suicidal intent/thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent is present (from step 2).
    *   However, the post does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or clear signs of preparation for suicide. It's a general statement about suicide being a ""solution"" without detailing how or when.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does *not* describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It discusses past feelings and interactions but no actual attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action of an attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post mentions ""death stranding"" which is a game title, not a direct reference to suicidal intent. There are no mentions of suicide or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""About depression,"" ""hard to keep going,"" ""Every day feels like the previous one,"" ""badly mangled (psychically),"" ""slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away.""

    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrases ""hard to keep going"" and ""I wonder if a long-term cure even exists"" refer to the struggle with depression and the desire for relief from it, but not a direct wish to end life or cease existing. The post describes the *difficulty* of living with depression, not a *desire* to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die identified in Step 2, this post cannot be classified as 'Behavior'. (No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation is mentioned anyway).

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Based on the analysis, the post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and the chronic nature of depression (""hard to keep going,"" ""badly mangled,"" ""never really goes away""). However, it *lacks* any explicit expression of suicide and *lacks* a clear desire to die or end one's life. It fits the definition of 'Indicator' perfectly: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life...

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""my dad's cause of death and it was suicide"", ""finding out he committed suicide"", ""I get suicidal thoughts"". The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""makes it seem like it's inevitable for me"", ""can't stop thinking about it"", ""felt like shit for years"", ""reliving the same day everyday"", ""takes so much energy"", ""I keep saying to myself I'll see a doctor but deep down I know that's not true"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, and anhedonia.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""I'm 18 and my dad died when I was around 2"" provides context about the poster's age and their dad's death, not a timeframe for the poster's suicide. The statement ""I get suicidal thoughts but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" indicates a lack of intent to act on the thoughts.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None. The post explicitly states ""im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it,"" which means no past attempts are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""I get suicidal thoughts"", which is an explicit mention of suicidal ideation. The phrase ""makes it seem like it's inevitable for me"" in the context of his father's suicide also points to a clear contemplation of suicide for himself. This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation? No. The post explicitly states ""I get suicidal thoughts but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"", indicating that despite the thoughts, there is no plan or immediate intent to act.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The statement ""im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" confirms no such action has been taken.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit ""suicidal thoughts"" and a clear contemplation of suicide (""inevitable for me""), which means it is beyond 'Indicator'.
    - However, there is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations), and the poster explicitly states they are unlikely to act on these thoughts (""im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it""). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts"" multiple times. It also says ""I want to give up my life and just die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE,"" and ""If I die I know my parents would be devastated.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hopeless,"" ""losing my self esteem very fast,"" ""I hate myself,"" ""I feel trapped,"" ""no future for me.""
    *   **Specific plans:** There is no mention of a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide. The post highlights a desire to die but also a conflict (""but I can't leave my parents too"").
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and clear, unambiguous expressions of wanting to die (""I want to give up my life and just die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"").
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post does *not* mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means being acquired, a specific location, a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or any preparations (e.g., ""writing notes"").
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does *not* describe any specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life. It focuses on current feelings and thoughts.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive (""I want to die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"").
    *   However, it explicitly lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations).
    *   This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I've been cutting my self for a long time"" - clear self-harm, described as a coping mechanism (""to subvert the pain to a physical one"").
        *   ""For the past month I've been contemplating suicide."" - direct mention of suicide.
        *   ""I didn't want to live before I met her"" - clear desire not to be alive.
        *   ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it."" - direct statement of intent to end life.
        *   ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" - explicit suicide pact/plan involving the poster.
        *   Mentions another person's suicide attempt: ""she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide"". This is about another person, not the poster.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""numb,"" ""don't get any joy out of life,"" ""fucking lost here.""
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it."" - This is a conditional timeframe and method (""ending it"") for the poster's own suicide.
        *   ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" - This is a specific plan for a joint suicide, including a conditional timeframe and a shared method (""do it together""). This constitutes a plan for the poster.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The cutting is described as self-harm for pain diversion, not explicitly as an attempt to end life. The definition for 'Attempt' requires the action to be taken ""to try to end their life.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""contemplating suicide,"" ""ending it,"" ""didn't want to live,"" and ""kill her self then we will do it together.""
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post mention a plan?
        *   **Method:** ""ending it"" (general method) and ""do it together"" (implying a shared method).
        *   **Timeframe:** Conditional timeframes are present: ""if she gone"" and ""if she should want to kill her self."" The definition for Behavior includes ""a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., 'I'm ending it tonight', 'I plan to do it on my birthday', 'I'll kill myself at 21')"". A conditional timeframe still specifies *when* the plan would be executed.
        *   **Preparation:** The agreement/pact (""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"") can be considered a form of preparation or a concrete step towards a plan.
    *   Yes, there are clear elements of a plan (conditional timeframe, implied method, and a pact). This strongly points to 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post describes ""cutting my self for a long time"" but explicitly states the purpose was ""to subvert the pain to a physical one,"" not to end life. This does not meet the definition of 'Attempt' which requires the action to be taken ""to try to end their life.""
    *   The mention of the girlfriend's attempt is not the poster's own.
    *   Therefore, this does not classify as 'Attempt' for the poster.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by including specific elements of a plan: a conditional timeframe for ending his life (""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it"") and a concrete agreement/pact for a joint suicide (""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together""). These are specific, future-oriented actions or agreements related to suicide.
    *   While there's a history of self-harm, it's explicitly stated as a coping mechanism, not a past suicide attempt.
    *   Based on the presence of suicidal intent *and* a clear plan (even if conditional), 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Why is it frowned upon to kill yourself?"", ""So that means I need to die because it's better than living in pain.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""worse,"" ""wist for her,"" ""Life isn't worth it without her,"" ""I can't,"" ""I'm alone,"" ""living in pain,"" ""I'm fucked."" (Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness).
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: No description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. ""I've fucking tried"" refers to trying to move on, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill yourself"" and a clear desire to die (""I need to die because it's better than living in pain""). This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die.
    - Does it mention a specific method? No.
    - Does it mention specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
    - Does it mention a specific location? No.
    - Does it mention a specific timeframe? No.
    - Does it mention clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Since no elements of a specific plan are present, it does not fit the 'Behavior' category.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The phrase ""I've fucking tried"" refers to trying to cope or move on, not a suicide attempt.
    - Therefore, it does not fit the 'Attempt' category.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill yourself"") and a clear desire to die (""I need to die""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not contain any specific plan elements (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, based on the definitions, the post clearly falls under 'Ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die without a specific plan.

To be continued.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains multiple direct references to suicide and self-harm, primarily through quotes from the poster's parents. Examples: ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""If you disappeared,"" ""Just shoot yourself already,"" ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"". These quotes strongly imply that the poster has previously engaged in or contemplated these actions.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is saturated with indicators of severe emotional distress, worthlessness, and despair, stemming from parental abuse, invalidation, and rejection. The parents' statements are highly critical, dismissive of depression, and actively suggest self-harm/suicide.
    *   **Specific plans:** The poster does not explicitly state a *current* plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparations) for suicide. The methods mentioned (gun, cutting wrists) are in the context of the parents' past observations or suggestions, not the poster's current intent.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** The post contains clear references to past concrete actions taken by the poster. The father's repeated questions ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" directly describe past attempts/self-harm behaviors by the poster.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   While the poster does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself"" in the present tense, the entire context, especially the parents' repeated references to the poster's past ""attempts to kill yourself"" and ""cut your wrists,"" makes it evident that suicidal ideation and past actions are central to the poster's experience being described. The parents' dialogue *describes* the poster's past suicidal intent and actions.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   No current plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) is stated *by the poster* for a future suicide act. The methods mentioned are in the context of past actions or parental suggestions.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes. The post describes specific past concrete actions the poster took. The father's questions ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" are direct references to the poster's past attempts to end their life or engage in self-harm with suicidal intent. These are not vague references but point to specific actions (""try to kill yourself,"" ""cut your wrists"") that have occurred in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes past concrete actions taken by the poster to try to end their life (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes one or more specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life... A concrete action (what the person *did*) must be described."" Even though the description comes via parental quotes, it is a description of the poster's past actions. There is no stated *current* plan or current explicit ideation, but the presence of described past concrete actions is sufficient for 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself,"" ""Kim's"" (likely a typo for ""kill myself"").
    *   Emotional indicators: Desperate, rejecting help (""I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit""), demanding a ""straight up answer.""
    *   Specific plans: The post is a direct question asking for ""the least painful way to kill yourself."" This is a request for a specific method. While not stating a chosen method, it's actively seeking information *about* a method, which is a key element of planning.
    *   Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill yourself,"" ""Kim's"" (kill myself).
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, the entire context is about finding a way to end one's life.
    *   Since 'Yes' to explicit mentions, proceed to analyze for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present): Yes.
    *   Does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**: The user is *asking for* a specific method (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""). This is a direct inquiry about a method, indicating an active search for how to carry out the act. This constitutes a component of a plan.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed: No.
        *   A specific **location**: No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**: No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: No explicit signs, but asking for a method is a preparatory step in forming a plan.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a specific method"" as part of a plan. While the user hasn't *chosen* a method, they are actively *seeking* one. This moves beyond mere ideation (thoughts/desires without a plan) into the realm of active planning by soliciting information on *how* to commit suicide.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a clear desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is for thoughts/desires without a specific plan. 'Behavior' is for thoughts/desires *with* a plan, which includes mentioning a specific method. By asking ""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?"", the user is actively seeking a specific method. This active search for a method is a clear component of planning, even if the method hasn't been decided upon yet. It indicates a more advanced stage than just having the thought or desire to die. Therefore, it falls under 'Behavior'.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal note"" is a direct reference to suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside"" indicates severe emotional and possibly physical distress.
    - Specific plans: ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again."" Writing a suicide note is explicitly listed as a form of preparation or means in the 'Behavior' definition (""I've written a suicide note""). The word ""again"" indicates a past instance of this preparation, but the current statement is about a future action (""I think I'm going to write"").
    - Past concrete actions: The post does not describe a past concrete action taken to *attempt* suicide (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut myself""). It describes a past *preparation* (writing a note).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, ""suicidal note"" is an explicit mention related to suicide, implying a clear desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent is present (from ""suicidal note"").
    - The post mentions a clear sign of preparation: ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again."" The definition of 'Behavior' specifically includes ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent (e.g., 'I've written a suicide note')"". This fits perfectly.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. Writing a note is a preparation, not an attempt itself. The ""again"" refers to repeating the preparation, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear expression related to suicide (""suicidal note""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - It expresses suicidal intent and, crucially, mentions a specific preparation for suicide (""writing a suicidal note""). This falls under the 'Behavior' definition, which includes ""specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent (e.g., 'I've written a suicide note')"".
    - It does not describe a past concrete action of attempting suicide, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - Since a specific preparation (writing a note) is mentioned, it goes beyond mere 'Ideation'.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""slaying myself"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of self-inflicted death, akin to ""killing myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: The preceding phrase ""I will end up committing a massacre"" suggests extreme distress, anger, or violent ideation, which contextualizes the suicidal thought.
    - Specific plans: There is no mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for ""slaying myself.""
    - Past concrete actions: The post uses future tense (""I will end up... or maybe just slaying myself""), indicating a potential future action or thought, not a past concrete attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains ""slaying myself,"" which is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die by one's own hand. This is equivalent to ""kill myself"" or ""end my life.""
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - While there is a clear desire to die, the post does *not* mention:
        - A specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump"").
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed.
        - A specific location.
        - A specific timeframe.
        - Clear signs of preparation.
    - Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post describes a future possibility (""I will end up... or maybe just slaying myself""), not a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life.
    - Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die by suicide (""slaying myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete action of attempting suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings or a clear desire to not be alive, without a specific plan.

I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" It also explicitly states ""As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live.""
    - Emotional indicators: Shame, laziness, feeling stupid, feeling outclassed, intimidated, overwhelmed, passivity, mediocrity, struggling to act on dreams.
    - Specific plans: None. No method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: None. The post does not describe any specific past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, the post uses the phrase ""my suicidal ideation.""
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No, on the contrary, the post explicitly states: ""As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live.""

    *Analysis for Step 2*: The post *does* contain an explicit mention concerning suicide (""suicidal ideation""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator' which ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"". While the post also states ""I don't want to die— I want to live,"" which negates a *current desire to die*, the definition of 'Ideation' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"". The term ""suicidal ideation"" is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts. The post is reflecting on these thoughts as an underlying issue, even if the current sentiment is a desire to live. Therefore, the presence of the term ""suicidal ideation"" places it beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present in the form of ""suicidal ideation"" being mentioned as a part of the poster's experience), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide? No. There is no mention of a plan to commit suicide.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It is not 'Indicator' because it explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation.""
    - It is not 'Behavior' because, despite the mention of ""suicidal ideation,"" there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) mentioned.
    - It is not 'Attempt' because it does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.
    - It fits 'Ideation' because it includes an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (""my suicidal ideation""), even though the poster also states a desire to live. The definition of Ideation covers explicit expressions of such thoughts/feelings, regardless of whether they are currently active or being processed/overcome.

I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""shoot myself in the head,"" ""don't die,"" ""suicide hotline.""
    - Emotional indicators: Clear desire to end life, but also hesitation/fear regarding the outcome (disability).
    - Specific plans: ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head."" This describes a specific method (shoot myself in the head) and means (dad's handgun).
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""shoot myself in the head"" and refers to a ""suicide hotline,"" clearly indicating suicidal intent and a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes, the post mentions a specific **method** (""shoot myself in the head"") and specific **means** (""get my dad's handgun"") for suicide. Even though there's hesitation about the outcome, the plan itself is articulated clearly. This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. It discusses a potential future action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (""I wanna... shoot myself in the head"").
    - It also includes a specific plan, detailing both the method (""shoot myself in the head"") and the means (""get my dad's handgun"").
    - This directly matches the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/a desire to die... AND ALSO mentions... a plan to commit suicide... A plan MUST include one or more of the following: a specific method... specific means being acquired or possessed with suicidal intent... mention of specific tools/weapons... with clear intent for suicide.""
    - The hesitation expressed (""But at the same time I'm hesitant because what if I don't die..."") refers to the *outcome* of the plan, not the absence of the plan itself. The plan is clearly stated.

My life wasnt good before getting sick, but now, it has become unbearable.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post states ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" and ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving."" These are strong expressions of life not being desirable, which is a form of desire to cease living. There are no direct mentions of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Fuck this World,"" ""helpless, angry and sad,"" ""unbearable,"" ""nothing i can enjoy anymore,"" ""I hate this world,"" ""I hate how this world works,"" ""I hate the people in my country."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, and distress.
    - Specific plans: No specific methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""Idk i can't do anything anymore"" indicates helplessness, not a plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No descriptions of past suicide attempts or concrete self-harm actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" etc.: No.
    - Other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: Yes. The phrases ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" and ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving"" are clear and unambiguous expressions of a desire for life to end or not to continue, aligning with the ""clear desire to not be alive any longer"" part of the 'Ideation' definition (similar to ""I hate living"" or ""I want it to be over""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No. There is no indication of how, where, or when any potential suicidal act would occur, nor any preparation for it.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire for life to end (""my life isn't worth living anymore,"" ""I can't see myself having a life worth living""), which places it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - However, it lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) for suicide, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - It also does not describe any specific past concrete actions of a suicide attempt, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes... a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""I'll be gone"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""don't see the point anymore"".
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: Not explicitly stated.
        - Means: Not explicitly stated.
        - Locations: Not explicitly stated.
        - Specific timeframes: ""soon"", ""not on Christmas"", ""by February"". The phrase ""by February I think I'll be gone"" indicates a specific timeframe for the intended act.
        - Preparations: ""hope I believe behind something good"" is not a clear preparation as defined (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means).
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""I'll be gone"", which are direct expressions of suicidal intent and a clear desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2, the post mentions a specific timeframe for carrying out suicide: ""by February I think I'll be gone"". According to the definition of 'Behavior', a plan MUST include one or more elements, and ""a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., 'I'm ending it tonight,' 'I plan to do it on my birthday,' 'I'll kill myself at 21')"" is one such element. The phrase ""by February"" clearly fits this criterion.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""kill myself"", ""I'll be gone"") and a clear desire to die.
    - Crucially, it includes a specific timeframe (""by February"") for when the act is intended to occur. This element of a plan, as defined in the 'Behavior' category, differentiates it from 'Ideation'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts."" It also discusses the ""world is falling apart and soon will turn into hell,"" which indicates a bleak outlook but not direct self-harm intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""suffering,"" ""mental illnesses,"" ""pessimistic.""
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: No specific past suicide attempts are described. The phrase ""suicidal thoughts helped me to understood"" refers to the thoughts themselves, not an action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts."" This indicates a clear presence of suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. It refers to past ""suicidal thoughts"" but not an actual attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts,"" which falls under the definition of 'Ideation' (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings).
    - There is no specific plan mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action of attempting suicide, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Since there is an explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts,"" it is more than just general distress, ruling out 'Indicator'.

    - Past concrete actions: No mention of any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No direct use of these exact phrases.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""thinking of ending it all"" is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to cease existing/end one's life. The phrase ""So what is the point anymore I've failed"" further reinforces this sentiment in the context of ""ending it all.""
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die/end life. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:

        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent: No.
        - A specific location being considered for suicide: No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide: No.

    - Conclusion: No specific plan elements are present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post discusses current thoughts (""thinking of ending it all""), not a past action.
    - Conclusion: No past attempt described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to end one's life (""thinking of ending it all"") which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I want to get it over with,"" ""my death will be following very soon too."" These phrases clearly indicate an intent to end life.
    - Emotional indicators: Expresses a sense of finality and consideration for family (""I feel kind of sorry for my mom,"" ""I hope she learns to cope well""), indicating a resolved state regarding ending their life.
    - Specific plans:
        - Timeframe: ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend."" This is a specific timeframe.
        - Preparations: ""It's probably best if I get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents."" This is a clear preparatory action.

    - The post contains unambiguous expressions of wanting to die and cease existing: ""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I want to get it over with,"" ""my death will be following very soon too.""
    - This is a 'Yes'. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend."" (Yes)
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: ""It's probably best if I get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents."" (Yes)
    - Since there are specific elements of planning (timeframe and preparation), this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere thoughts or a general desire to die by including specific elements of a plan: a timeframe (""this weekend"") and preparations (""get a will in place""). This moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""The final test that will decide whether or not I'll live till October is coming up."" - Implies a life-or-death scenario tied to a test outcome.
        *   ""for the first time i don't wanna die, it's not like i wanna live either"" - Explicitly addresses desire to die (or lack thereof) and ambivalence about living.
        *   ""i don't want to waste money to then die right after."" - Suggests dying is still a possibility being considered.
        *   ""But i really cannot live if i fail."" - Conditional statement of not being able to live.
        *   ""The right time is gone, i have no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep."" - This is critical. It mentions past self-harm (""blades i used to cut"") and the *lack* of current specific means/methods for suicide.
        *   ""I don't even know how I'll do it"" - Reinforces the lack of a current specific plan.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""almost happy,"" ""almost enjoying,"" ""feeling better,"" ""decent place right now,"" ""want to keep doing things."" This indicates a current improvement in mood, but the underlying suicidal thoughts are still present, albeit with ambivalence and a lack of current means.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post explicitly states ""no access to my meds, no place to jump from"" and ""I don't even know how I'll do it."" This clearly indicates the *absence* of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) for a *current* suicide attempt.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** ""the blades i used to cut won't go that deep."" This is a direct description of a past concrete action (""cut"") taken by the poster, implying self-harm that was potentially intended to be lethal or was severe.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes. While the poster states ""for the first time i don't wanna die,"" they immediately follow with ""it's not like i wanna live either"" and ""But i really cannot live if i fail."" The discussion of ""no access to my meds, no place to jump from"" also implies previous consideration of these methods for ending life. There is a clear, albeit conditional and ambivalent, desire to die or thoughts about ending life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   No. The post explicitly states the *absence* of a current specific plan: ""no access to my meds, no place to jump from,"" and ""I don't even know how I'll do it."" This rules out 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes. The phrase ""the blades i used to cut won't go that deep"" describes a **specific past concrete action** (""cut"") taken by the poster. This fits the definition of 'Attempt' which requires a description of what they *did*. The context of discussing methods of suicide (""no access to my meds, no place to jump from"") further supports this interpretation as a past action related to suicidal intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation/desire to die (even if ambivalent), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It explicitly states the *lack* of a current specific plan, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    *   It describes a **specific past concrete action** (""the blades i used to cut"") taken by the poster, which directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'. The 'Attempt' definition explicitly states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" In this case, there's a past concrete action described, and current ideation (not a plan) about potential future suicide. The presence of the past concrete action is the determining factor.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**

    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrase ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" expresses despair and feeling lost, but it is not an unambiguous expression of wanting to die or cease existing. It indicates a lack of direction and severe distress, but not suicidal intent. The feeling of being ""exhausted and thrown out"" refers to a systemic issue, not a personal desire to die by self-infliction.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die (as determined in Step 2), this post cannot be 'Behavior'. There are no mentions of method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, exhaustion, and a feeling of being directionless (""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"").
    *   However, it *lacks* any explicit mention of suicide or a clear, unambiguous desire to die or end one's life. Phrases like ""taken my will to strive"" or ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" fall under general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'Indicator' is for posts lacking explicit suicide expression AND lacking a clear desire to die, but containing general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, etc.
        *   'Ideation' requires explicit suicidal thoughts OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living"").
    *   This post fits the 'Indicator' definition perfectly as it shows severe distress and hopelessness but no clear desire to die.

Im sorry everyone. Im not strong enough.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""kill myself"", ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"", ""start cutting myself to try and ease my pain"". It also mentions ""Its a net gain for the world if i die"", ""I'm just waiting for the end"", and ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""failed"", ""failure"", ""toxic family"", ""depression, fear, regret and worthlessness"", ""dumbass"", ""lazy asshole"", ""hate myself"", ""sad"", ""afraid"", ""not strong enough"".
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Methods:** ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"". ""start cutting myself"" is also mentioned, though framed as easing pain, it's within the context of other lethal methods.
        *   **Means:** ""a gun"" (mentioned as a potential tool).
        *   **Locations:** ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't"" suggests a location is being considered, but not a *specific* identifiable place (like ""the bridge""). ""if im far enough away and cut off enough"" implies a desire for isolation for the act.
        *   **Specific timeframes:** ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do."" This is a conditional timeframe, not a fixed date/time like ""tonight"" or ""on my 21st birthday"". ""I'm just waiting for the end"" is passive.
        *   **Preparations:** None explicitly mentioned (e.g., writing notes, giving away possessions).
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and clear expressions of wanting to die (""Its a net gain for the world if i die"", ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold"", ""I'm just waiting for the end"").
    *   This confirms the post is beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   The post mentions specific **methods**: ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"".
    *   It also mentions specific **tools/weapons** with clear intent for suicide: ""a gun"".
    *   These elements are sufficient to classify it as 'Behavior' according to the definition.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does *not* describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. Vague references are not present, nor are concrete descriptions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post does not describe a past concrete action of attempting suicide, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post goes beyond general suicidal thoughts by detailing specific methods (""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"") and mentioning a specific means (""a gun"") for suicide. This fulfills the criteria for 'Behavior' as it includes a specific method and means.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No direct mentions of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" ""dying,"" or ""self-harm.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses significant emotional distress, including feelings of the world being ""shit,"" paranoia (""people around me are out to get me,"" ""am I just paranoid as fuck?""), confusion (""I don't know what I'm doing wrong,"" ""I seriously don't know what's real,"" ""how do I know which 'delusions' are real""), feelings of being played/manipulated, abandonment issues, feeling ""unlovable,"" and a strong desire to cry. There's a desperate plea for ""the damn truth.""
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of any method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. While the post conveys extreme distress, confusion, and feelings of worthlessness (""why am I so unlovable""), it does not express a desire to die, not be alive, or cease existing. The core of the distress seems to be about understanding reality, being loved, and dealing with perceived manipulation and paranoia.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die, this step is not applicable for classifying as 'Behavior'. Even if it were, no elements of a plan are present.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly indicates significant emotional distress, feelings of worthlessness (""unlovable""), paranoia, and confusion, which aligns with ""general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life"" as described in the 'Indicator' definition.
    *   It does not contain any explicit mentions of suicide or a clear, unambiguous desire to die, which would be required for 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not include any elements of a plan, which would be required for 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe any past concrete actions of an attempt, which would be required for 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category due to the presence of severe emotional distress and negative self-perception without any explicit suicidal ideation or intent.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment.""), self-hatred, anxiety, guilt.

        *   **Explicit statement of plans:** ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No. The post mentions ""I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year."" and ""Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked."" These refer to coping/support methods, not past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:** Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""I want to die,"" and ""contemplating suicide."" This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):** Yes. The post details specific methods (ingesting isopropyl alcohol, hanging, jumping in front of a car), means (isopropyl alcohol, noose), and preparations (calculating amounts, testing attachment points, figuring out how to avoid detection). The poster explicitly states, ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself."" This clearly meets the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:** No. The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to end their life. References to ""methods"" that ""fell through"" refer to coping strategies, not suicide attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post describes highly specific and detailed plans, methods, means, and preparations for suicide. This goes beyond mere 'Ideation' (which is defined as ideation *without* a specific plan).
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action of attempting suicide, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with detailed planning and preparation places this post firmly in the 'Behavior' category. The fact that the poster states they haven't acted *yet* due to a specific personal conviction does not negate the extensive planning described, which is the core of the 'Behavior' definition.

    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of a past concrete action. ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to long-term ideation, not an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to end life (""the day i chose is very soon"", ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"", ""i'm not cut out for life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**

        *   **Timeframe:** Yes, ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates an imminent timeframe.
        *   **Preparations:** Yes, the contemplation of calling grandparents, telling friends ""I love them"", and hugging a little brother are clear signs of saying goodbyes, which fall under preparations.
    *   Since both a specific timeframe and preparations are mentioned, this strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The phrase ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to long-term ideation, not a described past attempt.

    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes a specific, imminent timeframe (""very soon"") and clear signs of preparation (saying goodbyes to loved ones), which fit the definition of a 'plan' for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a concrete past action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""most suicidal I've been"", ""want to be out of my misery"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""pain"", ""cba anymore"" (can't be bothered anymore), ""misery"".
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, specific timeframe for the act (e.g., ""tonight"", ""at 21""), or preparations are mentioned. ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" indicates withdrawal but not a plan for suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of a past concrete action to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""most suicidal I've been"".
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die/cease existing: ""I Just want to be out of my misery"".
    - Since there's explicit suicidal language and a clear desire to die, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses suicidal intent/desire to die.
    - Does it mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills"")? No.
    - Does it mention specific means being acquired (e.g., ""bought a gun"")? No.
    - Does it mention a specific location (e.g., ""jumping off the bridge"")? No.
    - Does it mention a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., ""doing it tonight"", ""on my 21st birthday"")? No. The phrase ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" is about social withdrawal, not a timeframe for the suicide act itself.
    - Does it mention clear signs of preparation (e.g., ""writing my note"")? No.
    - Since no elements of a specific plan are present, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" refers to the intensity of current suicidal thoughts, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""most suicidal I've been"") and a desire to die (""I Just want to be out of my misery"").
    - It does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe for the act, or preparations).
    - It does not describe a specific past concrete action of an attempt.

    *   Emotional indicators: Despair, frustration (""Why is it so hard to die,"" ""I can't find a suitable way to go"").
    *   Specific plans: None mentioned. The post explicitly states ""I can't find a suitable way to go,"" indicating a *lack* of a plan.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""I just want to die"" and ""I just want to kill myself.""
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die and explicit suicidal language, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation. On the contrary, it states, ""I can't find a suitable way to go,"" which means there is no plan.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It focuses on current desire and difficulty finding a way.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I just want to die,"" ""I just want to kill myself"").
    *   However, it explicitly states the *absence* of a plan (""I can't find a suitable way to go"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Im in the low point"", ""shitty grammar"" (implies distress), ""zero social skills/low self esteem/lonely"". These indicate general distress, feelings of inadequacy, and isolation.
    - Specific plans: None. The post discusses a potential plan to move to another country for ""better living,"" which is a coping mechanism, not a suicide plan.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrases ""low point,"" ""lonely,"" and ""zero social skills"" indicate distress and dissatisfaction with life, but not a direct desire to die or cease existing. The user is asking for ""ADVICE"" and if ""it is worth moving in another country for better living?"", which implies a desire to improve their life, not end it.

    - Since 'No' to both, the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no suicidal intent or desire to die expressed.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Not applicable, as there is no description of a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress, low self-esteem, loneliness, and a feeling of being at a ""low point."" These align with the definition of 'Indicator' which includes ""general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life.""
    - There is no explicit mention of suicide or a clear desire to die. The user is seeking advice on improving their life by potentially moving, which contradicts a suicidal intent.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no ""clear desire to not be alive any longer.""
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no suicidal plan.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as there is no description of a past concrete action.
    - Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate classification.

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
    - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm (direct and indirect language). The post mentions ""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP"". This is a wish for *another person* to die.
    - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, anhedonia, etc.). The primary emotion is anger/vengefulness directed at another person.
    - Look for specific plans: methods, means, locations, specific timeframes (e.g., ""tonight"", ""next week"", a specific date/age like ""at 21""), or preparations (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means, saying goodbyes). No plans related to the poster's own suicide.
    - Check for clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists""). No past actions related to the poster's own suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want it all to end,"" ""I'm going to die soon"" when in a context of severe distress)? No. The desire for death is directed outwards (""I hope *you* die""), not inwards towards the poster themselves.
    - If 'No' to both of the above (i.e., no explicit suicide terms AND no other clear desire to die expressed), then the post is likely 'Indicator'. This is the case here.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention: Not applicable, as no self-directed suicidal intent is present.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, and strictly following the definitions below, which category fits best?
    - The post expresses anger and a wish for *another person* to die. It does not contain any self-directed expressions of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, or self-harm intent from the person writing the post.
    - According to the ""IMPORTANT RULES"", the suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post.
    - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""life sucks,"" ""I'm so unhappy,"" ""I feel worthless,"" ""I'm struggling"")."" This post fits this definition because the distress (anger) is present, but there is no self-directed suicidal intent or desire to die.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no self-directed desire to die or suicidal thoughts.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' because there is no self-directed suicidal plan.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past self-directed suicide attempt.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I will kill my bullie,"" and ""I will kill her"" multiple times. It also mentions ""type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses extreme anger, frustration, and a desire for peace, but this is framed around killing another person.
    *   **Specific plans:** The user asks, ""Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?"" This indicates a desire for a method to kill *another person*.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No mention of past suicide attempts by the poster themselves.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases *referring to the poster's own life*? No. The phrase ""type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others"" is a general statement, not an expression of the poster's own suicidal intent. The intent is directed outward, towards another person.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing *by the poster themselves*? No. The desire expressed is to kill someone else ""to finally live my life in peace."" This is homicidal, not suicidal.
    *   Since there is no explicit suicide term AND no clear desire to die expressed *by the poster about themselves*, the post is likely 'Indicator' based on this step. The core subject is violence towards others, not self-harm or suicide by the poster.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   This step is only relevant if suicidal intent/desire to die by the poster is present. As determined in Step 2, the intent is homicidal, not suicidal for the poster. Therefore, this step does not lead to 'Behavior' for suicide risk.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end *their own* life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses severe distress and homicidal ideation, but it lacks any direct or indirect expression of the poster's own suicidal intent or desire to die. The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   Therefore, based on the definitions:
        *   It is not 'Ideation' because there is no clear desire for the *poster* to not be alive or explicit suicidal thoughts *about themselves*.
        *   It is not 'Behavior' because there is no suicidal intent or plan by the *poster* for *themselves*.
        *   It is not 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past suicide attempt by the *poster*.
        *   It fits 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress (""I have a problem,"" ""this women is bullying me"") and dissatisfaction with life (""to finally live my life in peace""), but without any self-inflicted intent or a wish to cease living. The context of violence towards others, while serious, does not qualify as suicide risk for the poster.

I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all."" Also, ""the stress might kill me before I even kill myself"" indicates a preoccupation with death and suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""cannot do this anymore,"" ""mental health really bad,"" ""stress,"" ""disappointment,"" ""failure.""
    *   **Specific plans:** The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" implies a plan exists in the user's mind. However, the post *does not explicitly state* any specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""end it all."" It clearly expresses a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post mention:
        *   A specific **method**? No (e.g., no mention of pills, jumping, etc.).
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed? No.
        *   A specific **location**? No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**? No.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**? No.
    *   The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" indicates the *existence* of a plan in the user's mind, but it *does not describe* any of the specific elements required by the 'Behavior' definition (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation). According to the guideline, if uncertain about the presence of an *explicit* plan (as defined), choose 'Ideation'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all""), so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. While ""I know exactly what to do"" suggests a plan, the post *lacks the explicit mention of a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation* that is required for the 'Behavior' category. The definition for 'Ideation' states it is ""WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide. A plan is defined by mentioning a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations."" Since these specific elements are not explicitly stated, the post falls into 'Ideation'.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

    - Emotional indicators: Implies significant distress and a wish to escape current circumstances.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die: ""Someone kill me"" and ""I just wanna die"".
    - This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die, but it does NOT mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide. There is no plan outlined.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. It expresses a current desire.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I just wanna die"", ""Someone kill me""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action to end their life, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes a clear desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** None. The post uses phrases like ""tired of being unhappy,"" ""tired of being depressed,"" ""lost and alone,"" ""unhappy life."" These are expressions of distress, not suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of being unhappy,"" ""lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed,"" ""always rejected,"" ""unhappy life."" These clearly indicate significant emotional distress, despair, and dissatisfaction with life.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post expresses a strong desire for things to change (""make me normal,"" ""take all thoughts away,"" ""take all gayness away all gender disphoria all depresion everything negetive out my life""), and profound unhappiness, but it does not state a wish to die or cease existing. The repeated ""please god"" is a plea for intervention and change, not for an end to life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent or clear desire to die, this step is not applicable for classifying as 'Behavior'. Even if it were, no elements of a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) are present.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly indicates significant distress, unhappiness, and depression (""tired of being unhappy,"" ""lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed"").
    *   However, it *lacks* any explicit mention of suicide and *lacks* a clear desire to die or end one's life. The pleas are for a change in circumstances and identity, not for non-existence.
    *   Based on the definitions:
        *   'Attempt' is ruled out as no past concrete action is described.
        *   'Behavior' is ruled out as there is no plan and no clear desire to die/suicidal ideation.
        *   'Ideation' is ruled out because there are no explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings or a clear desire to not be alive any longer. The distress is about current life circumstances and identity, not about wanting to die.
        *   'Indicator' fits perfectly: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life (e.g., 'life sucks,' 'I'm so unhappy,' 'I feel worthless,' 'I'm struggling')."" This post is a strong expression of distress and dissatisfaction with life, seeking relief and change, but without crossing into suicidal ideation or intent.

441,"Anyone suicidal from knee pain?. Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly asks ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"". This directly uses the term ""suicidal"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts,"" ""no change in sight."" This indicates chronic pain, frustration, and hopelessness regarding the pain's resolution.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past attempts are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, the post uses the word ""suicidal"". While framed as a question (""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?""), in the context of the poster's personal suffering and hopelessness about their condition, it strongly implies the poster is experiencing or contemplating suicidal thoughts themselves, or at least considering suicide as a response to their situation. It's not just general distress; it directly introduces the concept of ""suicidal"" as a potential outcome of their pain.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" in the context of chronic, unresolving pain suggests that the poster is grappling with the idea of suicide due to their suffering. This is sufficient to move beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present or strongly implied by the use of ""suicidal"" in a personal context), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation? No, there is no mention of *how*, *where*, or *when* any suicidal act might occur, nor any preparation.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No, there is no description of any past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly uses the term ""suicidal"" in relation to the poster's personal experience of chronic pain and hopelessness. This indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or at least the contemplation of them, which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - However, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category, as it includes an explicit mention of ""suicidal"" thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I don't think I can go on much longer."" (Implies desire to end current state)
        *   ""I'm over life."" (Direct expression of wanting life to end)
        *   ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" (Implies a final task before ending life; ""finally over"" refers to life ending)
        *   ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death and not feel so guilty."" (Clear desire for death, viewing it as an escape)
        *   ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again."" (Connects personal desire for death with reunion, reinforcing suicidal intent)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""destroyed me mentally,"" ""pain,"" ""alone,"" ""abandoned,"" ""ruined,"" ""irreparable damage,"" ""distant,"" ""hate,"" ""guilty."" High levels of distress, hopelessness, despair.
    *   **Specific plans:** ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This indicates a *preparatory action* or a *time-bound condition* (""after this, it's over"") before the intended act of ending life. While not a method or location, it functions as a clear step leading to the intended end.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** None described by the poster for themselves. The mention of someone else's suicide is not relevant for classifying the *poster's* risk.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   No explicit use of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" by the poster for themselves.
    *   However, there are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/not be alive: ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""I'm over life,"" ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death."" These are strong indicators of a clear desire to cease existing.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die/not be alive. This means it is at least 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent is present (from Step 2).
    *   Does the post mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations?
        *   **Method:** No.
        *   **Means:** No.
        *   **Location:** No.
        *   **Timeframe/Preparation:** ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This phrase suggests a *specific task* or *condition* that must be completed *before* the act of ending life. This functions as a form of preparation or a conditional timeframe. It's a concrete pre-suicidal step.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions the *poster* took to try to end their life. The mention of someone else's suicide is not relevant for this category for the poster.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm over life,"" ""looking forward to... death""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post does not describe a past concrete attempt by the poster, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The key distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is suicidal thoughts without a plan. 'Behavior' includes a plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations).
    *   The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" indicates a specific *preparatory action* or a *conditional timeframe* before the intended end. This moves it beyond mere ideation into the realm of 'Behavior' because it outlines a specific step or condition leading to the act.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I want to die.""
    - Emotional indicators: Anger, resentment, pain, desire for revenge (""make my mom feel pain,"" ""she belittles me,"" ""so she can feel pain and hurt"").
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is, it'll be worth it"" refers to the *impact* of their death, not the *how* or *when* of the act itself.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I want to die."" This is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.

Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror.

    - The presence of specific methods, means, and preparation strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide. ""My life has already been over for six years now"" is a metaphorical expression of despair, not a description of a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to end life and explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts by detailing specific methods (""pistol"", ""gasoline and light up""), means (""pistol"", ""gasoline"", ""escape bag""), and preparation (""escape bag""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete suicide attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category.

But everytime I try I fail. Today I failed because my best and only friend wants to have dinner with me on sunday and I can't leave him alone down here. I was raped for 10 years by my father and grandfather and it was recorded. I was at the police but the didn't even inform the suspect, there was no trial. nothing. ""Lack of proof"" . and they didn't even search for proof. &amp;#x200B;. I can't go on like this. I'm 27 years old. I have nightmares every night, I have nobody . only my best friend who understands me. he's the reason why I'm still here. I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it. Today was a Fwb visiting me and I felt so dirty and I didn't feel secure and he touched me but stoped when I didnt react. I didn't feel like talking so I kept everything to myseld. When he said he would leave, I asked him if he wouldn't wanna talk about it and he just said that he is mentally drain (15 years realtionship then break up) but I can't do this right now. Humans only care about you, when they get something from you. God left me alone, he never answered my prayers. I was in therapy on and off since I was 15.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck."" (Current, imminent self-harm/suicide action)
        *   ""I've been suicidale all my life."" (Direct mention of suicidal thoughts/state)
        *   ""When I was four I told my mom that I would wanna go to the angels."" (Indirect desire to die)
        *   ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists."" (Past concrete action)
        *   ""When I was 19 I laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over."" (Past concrete action)
        *   ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train."" (Past concrete action)
        *   ""But everytime I try I fail."" (Refers to past attempts)
        *   ""Today I failed because my best and only friend wants to have dinner with me on sunday and I can't leave him alone down here."" (Implies current suicidal intent, thwarted)
        *   ""I can't go on like this."" (Clear desire to end suffering/life)
        *   ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it."" (Future intent to commit suicide)
        *   ""I just can't pull myself togehter and just do it."" (Refers to the act of suicide)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I can't go on like this,"" ""my life is just full of rape, abuse and suffering""), despair, worthlessness (""I felt so dirty""), self-deprecation (""I'm a chicken""), anhedonia (implied by lack of reaction to Fwb).
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck."" - This describes a specific method (rope), means (chair, rope), and implied location (where they are). This is a very active and imminent step towards suicide.
        *   ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it."" - This indicates a specific timeframe (""then"") for carrying out the act.
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions:**
        *   ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists."" (Yes, specific action)
        *   ""When I was 19 I laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over."" (Yes, specific action)
        *   ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train."" (Yes, specific action)

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions (""suicidale"") and very clear desires to die (""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck,"" ""I can't go on like this,"" ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post describes a specific method, means, and implied location for a *current* suicidal act (""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck""). It also mentions a timeframe for future intent (""then do it""). This strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post describes multiple specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life: ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists,"" ""When I was 19 I laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over,"" and ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train."" These are clear descriptions of what they *did*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (Step 2 is Yes), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It describes a *current* plan/imminent action (""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"") which would classify it as 'Behavior'.
    *   Crucially, it also describes multiple *specific past concrete actions* taken to try to end their life (e.g., ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists,"" ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train""). This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.
    *   The 'Attempt' definition explicitly states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'."" Since both conditions are met (multiple past concrete attempts are described, and current plans/imminent actions are mentioned), 'Attempt' is the correct classification.

447,"Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?. I feel like I'm at the point in my life where if I die then I die. As of right now I don't have any plans to end it, but I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come. Even if that means I die at 50 or earlier. I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be. Especially when I see that the future is really grim.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post directly asks ""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?"". It also contains phrases like ""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" ""die at 50 or earlier,"" and ""not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""future is really grim"" indicates hopelessness.
    - Specific plans: The post explicitly states, ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it."" It mentions ""stopped visiting the doctor's,"" which is a form of self-neglect or passive acceptance of death, but not an active plan to *cause* death (i.e., a method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation for suicide).
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post uses the word ""suicidal"" directly in the question.
    - Yes, there are other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or not wanting to be alive: ""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" ""not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be.""
    - Conclusion: The post is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post explicitly states, ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it.""
    - While ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" and ""willing to accept when my time has come"" suggest a passive stance towards death, this does not constitute a *specific plan* (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations) as defined for 'Behavior'. The definition of 'Behavior' requires an active, concrete plan to *commit* suicide, not merely a passive acceptance of death or self-neglect.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal language (""suicidal"") and clear expressions of a desire to cease living or a profound indifference to continuing life (""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" ""not worth pushing my life further""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly states ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it."" While the passive acceptance of death is concerning, it does not meet the criteria for a *specific plan* (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) required for 'Behavior'. The non-attendance at doctor's appointments is not an active plan to *commit* suicide.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' because it expresses suicidal thoughts and a clear desire not to be alive, but without a specific plan to act on those thoughts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""too much of a coward to kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I just fucking hate myself,"" ""too depressed,"" ""too ugly,"" ""too lazy,"" ""thyroid is too fucked up"" indicate severe self-loathing, depression, worthlessness, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" actively indicates the *absence* of a plan or intent to act.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? While the post expresses deep distress and self-hatred, the ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" part suggests a lack of current intent to act, but the *thought* and the *term* are clearly present. According to the Ideation definition, ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"")."" This condition is met.
    - Since ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present, or explicit mention of suicide term is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" explicitly negates the presence of a plan or immediate intent to act.
    - Therefore, there is no plan present, ruling out 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. There are no descriptions of what they *did*. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly uses the term ""kill myself,"" which, according to the 'Ideation' definition (""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"")""), means it is at least 'Ideation'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations) mentioned. In fact, the phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" indicates the *absence* of a plan or current intent to act on the thought. This prevents it from being 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit as it captures the explicit suicidal thought without a plan.

A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it.

Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""thinking about suicide"" but explicitly states this is in the context of ""a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide."" It's about helping *others*, not the poster themselves.
    - Emotional indicators: No emotional indicators for the poster's own state. The tone is advisory and supportive towards others.
    - Specific plans: None.
    - Past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide"" is mentioned.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No.
    - *Crucial point*: The mention of ""suicide"" refers to a *friend*, not the person writing the post. The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned."" Therefore, based on the poster's own content, there is no explicit suicide mention or clear desire to die *from the poster*.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no suicidal intent or desire to die expressed by the poster.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Not applicable, as there is no description of a specific past concrete action taken by the poster to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post is about providing advice on how to help a friend who is struggling with suicidal thoughts. The content does not express any suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, or past attempts from the person who wrote the post.
    - It lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide *from the poster* and lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life *from the poster*.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Indicator'.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""no reason to live"" - Clear expression of hopelessness and desire not to live.
        *   ""it just seems like the end to me"" - Implies an end to life.
        *   ""I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that."" - Direct mention of ""suicide"" and an acceptance/contemplation of it.
        *   ""will only drive me further to killing myself."" - Direct mention of ""killing myself.""
        *   ""nature is just telling me it's time to die."" - Clear desire to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, hopelessness, worthlessness (""waste of life""), isolation (""no one anymore,"" ""no one""), extreme distress, feeling hurt.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), means (e.g., ""have the pills ready,"" ""bought a gun""), location, timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or preparations (e.g., ""writing notes,"" ""giving away things"") are mentioned. The mention of Ativan is about the *lack* of a coping mechanism, not a plan to use it for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past concrete actions to attempt suicide are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" (""suicide is their life's purpose"") and ""kill myself"" (""will only drive me further to killing myself"").
    *   It also contains other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die (""no reason to live,"" ""it's time to die"").
    *   Since there are explicit mentions and clear desires to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on the presence of suicidal intent, I look for a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation.
    *   The post states ""I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me."" This indicates a loss of a coping mechanism leading to increased distress and a feeling of ""the end,"" but it does *not* describe a plan to use Ativan or any other substance/method for suicide. It's about the *consequence* of not having the medication, not a *plan* involving it.
    *   No other elements of a specific plan are present.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. There are no phrases like ""I overdosed last year"" or ""when I tried to cut my wrists.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""drowning yourself"", ""guaranteed death"", ""smooth transition to death"", ""go and do that"". These are direct references to self-inflicted death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I think its the best option for me"" implies a deep level of despair or hopelessness, viewing death as an escape or solution.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""drowning yourself"" (explicitly stated).
        - Means: Not explicitly mentioned (e.g., specific tools or substances).
        - Location: ""ocean"" (specific location type).
        - Specific timeframes: ""If I get kicked out of my house"" - this is a conditional trigger for the action, indicating a future intent linked to an event.
        - Preparations: None explicitly mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post does not use the exact words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""drowning yourself"" is a direct and unambiguous phrase for self-inflicted death.
    - There are clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/cease existing: ""I think its the best option for me,"" ""guaranteed death,"" ""smooth transition to death,"" ""I might go and do that"" (referring to drowning).
    - Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die and a direct reference to a method of self-inflicted death. This is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific **method**: Yes, ""drowning yourself.""
        - Specific **means**: No.
        - A specific **location**: Yes, ""ocean.""
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""If I get kicked out of my house"" is a conditional timeframe, indicating a trigger for the action. While not a fixed date, it points to a specific future circumstance for the act.
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: No.
    - Since a specific method (""drowning yourself"") and a specific location (""ocean"") are mentioned, this strongly suggests 'Behavior'. The conditional timeframe further solidifies this.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post discusses future actions (""If I get kicked out... I might go and do that"") and questions about a method, not a specific past concrete action taken to try to end their life.
    - Conclusion: Not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and discusses a specific method (""drowning yourself"") and a specific location (""ocean"") for doing so. It also provides a conditional timeframe (""If I get kicked out of my house""). This combination of suicidal intent with a specific method and location fits the definition of 'Behavior'. It is not 'Ideation' because a plan (method, location) is present. It is not 'Attempt' as no past concrete action is described. It is definitely not 'Indicator' as there's a clear desire to die and a specific method discussed.

So Disney just announced they'll be releasing a Star Wars dozen films/tv shows in the coming years and it's all I've ever wanted in life :) That should hopefully postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so lol. I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""not to kill myself"", ""suicide attempts"".
    - Emotional indicators: The post implies a history or current presence of suicidal thoughts/intent, as the person is finding a ""reason not to kill myself"" and hoping to ""postpone any suicide attempts"".
    - Specific plans: No specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe for action, or preparations) for a *current* or *future* suicide act is mentioned. Instead, a reason to *postpone* such acts is given.
    - Past concrete actions: The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" is a general reference to ""attempts"" but does not describe a *specific past concrete action* taken by the poster (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists""). It's a vague reference, not a detailed description of an action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"". This indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts or tendencies.
    - Since explicit suicide terms are present, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post does not mention a specific method, means, location, or timeframe for carrying out suicide. It explicitly states a reason *not* to act and to ""postpone"" any attempts. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life. The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" is a general reference to the concept of suicide attempts, not a description of a specific past event or action. This does not meet the strict definition of 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" indicating the presence of suicidal thoughts or a history of ideation. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan for a current or future suicide act; rather, the post describes finding a reason to *postpone* such acts. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - The reference to ""suicide attempts"" is general and does not describe a specific past concrete action taken by the poster. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The post clearly indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts/tendencies (""kill myself"", ""suicide attempts"") but without a current plan or a description of a specific past concrete action. This aligns perfectly with the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"")... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

I'm 32 and the thought of having to trudge on like this for another 50-60 years just makes this feeling even worse. I'm going nowhere in life, no friends, shitty job, shitty family, shitty neighbors, shitty house, shitty everything. I just want to end it all because I'm just so tired of living like this every day. I have no skills, no talents, nothing, I'm such a fucking worthless loser with nothing to contribute to this world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""no will to live anymore,"" ""I just want to end it all,"" ""tired of living like this."" These are clear expressions of a desire to cease living.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired and beaten,"" ""can't take it anymore,"" ""going nowhere,"" ""worthless loser,"" ""nothing to contribute."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., ""I have the pills""), location (e.g., ""the bridge""), or preparations (e.g., ""writing notes""). The mention of ""another 50-60 years"" refers to the perceived future duration of life, not a timeframe for suicide. The age ""32"" is the current age, not a planned age for suicide.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any specific past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut myself"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains clear and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/not be alive: ""no will to live anymore,"" ""I just want to end it all,"" ""tired of living like this every day.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (from Step 2).
    *   However, it does *not* mention:
        *   A specific method (e.g., ""gonna overdose"").
        *   Specific means being acquired or possessed (e.g., ""I have the pills ready"").
        *   A specific location (e.g., ""that tall building"").
        *   A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my 21st birthday""). The mention of ""another 50-60 years"" is about the *duration of life*, not a plan for suicide.
        *   Clear signs of preparation (e.g., ""writing my suicide note"").
    *   Therefore, there is no explicit plan.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Based on Step 2, there is a clear desire to die, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   Based on Step 3, there is no specific plan, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive and to ""end it all"" but lacks any specific plan or description of a past attempt. This perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation'.

    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. It refers to future intent (""I'm going to kill myself"") and current distress, not a past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""I'm going to kill myself,"" which is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.

    - There is no description of a past concrete action to attempt suicide, so it is not 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Feel like dying again."", ""Just kill me.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""endless misery of depression"", ""feeling like shit"", ""no end to anything"", ""tearing me apart"".
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions of attempting suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains the direct phrase ""Just kill me."" and ""Feel like dying again."" These are explicit expressions of a desire to die.
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a desire to die, but it does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping""), specific means being acquired, a specific location, a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or any preparations (e.g., ""writing notes"").
    - There are no elements of a plan as defined for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. Phrases like ""Feel like dying again"" refer to recurring feelings, not a past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

    - It lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a concrete past action of trying to end their life, which rules out 'Attempt'.

I dont know what options I have left. I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""smell of a Dead Body"" is mentioned, but it refers to a false report made by the landlord/neighbors, not the poster's own state or intent. There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, or dying in relation to the poster's own actions or desires.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm so tired,"" ""My heads messing with me,"" ""I just wanna leave this place,"" ""it's hard to deal,"" ""I cant take this torture from these people,"" ""I want to leave,"" ""I have no money to just walk out,"" ""I dont know what options I have left,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs."" These indicate extreme exhaustion, mental distress, paranoia, feelings of being trapped, hopelessness regarding their current situation, and suffering.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of any method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for suicide. The desire to ""leave this place"" refers to their apartment, not life.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrases ""I'm so tired"" and ""I cant take this torture"" express severe distress and exhaustion, but not a direct desire to die or cease existing. The desire to ""leave this place"" and ""walk out"" refers to their living situation, not life itself. The statement ""Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs"" expresses deep despair and paranoia, but not a direct wish to end their life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):** Not applicable, as there is no suicidal intent or clear desire to die expressed.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:** Not applicable, as no specific past concrete actions to attempt suicide are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Based on Step 2, there are no explicit suicide mentions and no clear desire to die.
    *   The post expresses general distress, exhaustion, hopelessness about their current situation (housing, finances, health), and feelings of being tortured and trapped. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive..., it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'."" Since no clear desire not to be alive is present, 'Indicator' is the correct classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Possible suicide date is in July."" This is a direct mention of suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""My parents don't love me,"" ""I have nobody :),"" ""Too bad I'm fucking debating it,"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope',"" ""I don't even know who I am anymore."" These express hopelessness, worthlessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans: ""Possible suicide date is in July."" This indicates a specific timeframe for a potential suicide act.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - The post contains explicit mention of ""suicide"" (""Possible suicide date"").
    - This confirms it is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - The post mentions a specific **timeframe** for carrying out suicide: ""Possible suicide date is in July."" The definition of 'Behavior' explicitly includes ""a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., 'I'm ending it tonight,' 'I plan to do it on my birthday,' 'I'll kill myself at 21')"". ""in July"" fits this criterion.
    - No specific method, means, location, or explicit preparations are mentioned, but the specific timeframe is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It refers to a future ""possible suicide date.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""Possible suicide date"") and includes a specific element of a plan, which is a specific timeframe (""in July"").
    - This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior', which requires explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND a plan including a specific timeframe.
    - It is not 'Indicator' because there's an explicit suicide mention and a plan element.
    - It is not 'Ideation' because a specific timeframe (a plan element) is present.
    - It is not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.

It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""makes me suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" and ""never kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""immediately get sad,"" ""It hurts so much.""
    *   **Specific plans:** There are no mentions of specific methods, means, locations, timeframes, or preparations for suicide. In fact, the post states, ""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person.""
    *   **Past concrete actions:** There is no description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal"" and ""kill myself."" This confirms the presence of suicidal ideation. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post does NOT mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for suicide. On the contrary, it states a reason *against* acting on the thoughts (""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person""). This clearly indicates a lack of a plan to commit suicide.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does NOT describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""makes me suicidal,"" ""never kill myself"") which rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The crucial point is the absence of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation). The post expresses the *thoughts* and *feelings* of being suicidal, but not any intent or steps towards carrying out an act. The statement ""I will probably never kill myself"" further reinforces the lack of a current plan or intent to act. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""ending it all"", ""suicide notes"", ""end it"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""awful year"", ""lonely bastard"", ""fucked it up"", ""fucking idiot"", ""tired of failing everyone"", ""can't fucking do another year"". These indicate despair, self-blame, hopelessness, and exhaustion.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: Not explicitly stated.
        - Means/Preparation: ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" This is preparation (writing a suicide note).
        - Location: None mentioned.
        - Specific timeframes: ""on new year's eve."" This is a specific timeframe.
    - Past concrete actions: The post mentions ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year,"" which are preparations, not concrete actions of an attempt (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to cut my wrists"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit phrases like ""ending it all,"" ""suicide notes,"" and ""end it,"" which clearly express a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from Step 2).
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific timeframe: ""on new year's eve."" (Yes)
        - Clear signs of preparation: ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" (Yes, writing a suicide note is preparation).
    - Since there is a specific timeframe and preparation, it strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year"" refers to preparation, not a physical attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear desire to die (""ending it all,"" ""end it""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - It contains a clear desire to die AND specific elements of a plan: a specific timeframe (""on new year's eve"") and preparation (""I've made 3 other suicide notes... this is the one"").
    - These elements fit the definition of 'Behavior' (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/a desire to die AND mentions a plan including a specific timeframe and means/preparation).
    - It does not describe a past concrete action of an attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I tried to cut myself last night"" - This is a clear description of a past self-harm action.
    - Emotional indicators: ""during a breakdown,"" ""very bad night,"" ""kind of drunk,"" ""wanted to feel something real"" - indicate significant distress and emotional dysregulation.
    - Specific plans: No future plans are mentioned.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""I tried to cut myself last night"" is a specific past concrete action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The stated motivation for cutting was ""wanted to feel something real,"" not explicitly a desire to die.

    *Initial thought:* Since there's no explicit desire to die, it might not be Ideation/Behavior. It describes a past action.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as the post describes a past event, not a current or future plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a **specific past concrete action** the poster took to try to end their life? Yes, ""I tried to cut myself last night.""
    - The 'Attempt' definition provides examples: ""e.g., 'I overdosed last year,' 'when I tried to cut my wrists,' 'my failed attempt with pills five months ago'.""
    - The phrase ""I tried to cut myself"" directly aligns with the example ""when I tried to cut my wrists"" provided under the 'Attempt' definition. While the stated motivation (""wanted to feel something real"") might suggest non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), the classification system's examples explicitly list ""tried to cut my wrists"" as an 'Attempt'. In a risk assessment context, such an action, especially during a ""breakdown,"" is considered a serious indicator and is categorized as an 'Attempt' by the provided guidelines. The system prioritizes the action itself when it's a known method of suicide and is listed as an example for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post describes a ""specific past concrete action"" (""I tried to cut myself last night"").
    - This action is similar to the example ""when I tried to cut my wrists"" provided in the 'Attempt' definition.
    - Despite the stated motivation being ""to feel something real"" rather than explicitly ""to die,"" the action of ""trying to cut myself"" is a form of self-harm that can be lethal and is explicitly used as an example of an 'Attempt' in the provided definitions. In this classification framework, describing such a past action triggers the 'Attempt' category.
    - It is not 'Indicator' because it describes a concrete self-harm action that is explicitly linked to the 'Attempt' category via examples.
    - It is not 'Ideation' or 'Behavior' as it describes a past action, not current ideation or a future plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""lost feelings for me"", ""became toxic"", ""nothing and no one"", ""no purpose to live"". These indicate hopelessness, worthlessness, despair.
    - Specific plans: The phrase ""plan to kill myself"" indicates suicidal intent and a state of planning, but the post does *not* specify a method, means, location, or timeframe for this plan.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Yes, ""plan to kill myself"".
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".
    - Since 'Yes' to explicit mentions, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific method for suicide? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location being considered for suicide? No.
        - A specific timeframe for carrying out suicide? No. (The age ""I'm 15"" is current, not a future date for the act).
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - Although the post says ""plan to kill myself"", it does not provide any of the *specific elements* of a plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation) required for 'Behavior'. The guideline states: ""If suicidal intent/desire to die is present, but you are genuinely uncertain about the presence of an explicit plan (as defined by method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation), choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" There is no explicit plan detail provided.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not describe any specific past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - While it states ""plan to kill myself"", it does not provide any specific details (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation) that would qualify it for 'Behavior' according to the definition. It expresses the *intention* to plan or that a plan exists, but not the *details* of the plan.
    - Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., using terms like 'suicide,' 'kill myself') OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""killing yourself soon.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The tone suggests a firm decision and a lack of hope for intervention (""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"").
    *   **Specific plans:** ""soon"" indicates a specific, albeit not precise, timeframe. The discussion about ""let folks know"" or ""just surprise em"" is a clear sign of preparation or consideration related to the act itself, not just a fleeting thought. It implies the act is impending and the user is thinking about its logistics/impact.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No mention of past concrete actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""killing yourself soon.""
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    *   The post mentions a specific **timeframe**: ""soon."" This is a strong indicator of a plan.
    *   It also shows signs of **preparation/consideration**: The user is actively thinking about *how* to communicate the impending act (""let folks know"" vs. ""surprise em""), which goes beyond mere ideation and into the realm of planning for the event. The statement ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"" reinforces the intent and the belief that the plan will proceed.
    *   While a specific method isn't named, the presence of a timeframe (""soon"") and active consideration of the act's immediate impact/communication strongly points to 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""killing yourself soon"") and clearly expresses a desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   It contains explicit suicidal ideation (""killing yourself""). Crucially, it also includes a specific timeframe (""soon"") and shows active consideration of the act's execution and immediate aftermath (how to inform others), which constitutes planning. This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' into 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to kill myself"" (direct language).
    - Emotional indicators: ""struggled daily with loneliness,"" ""no gf, friends,"" ""What a joke,"" ""I hate pets.""
    - Specific plans: ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching"" (specific timeframe). ""Already started to cancel friendships"" (preparation/saying goodbyes).
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""I want to kill myself,"" which is an explicit mention of suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - The post mentions a specific timeframe: ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching.""
    - It also mentions preparation: ""Already started to cancel friendships.""
    - These elements clearly fit the definition of a 'plan' under the 'Behavior' category (specific timeframe, means/preparation).

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It describes future intent and current preparations.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself,"" ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a clear desire to die AND specific elements of a plan: a set date (timeframe) and preparations (canceling friendships). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""so i dont kill myself"" and asks ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death."" These are direct mentions of suicide and self-inflicted death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""This life doesnt fit me,"" ""I don't like this shithole I live in,"" ""I can't change it."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. The act of sleeping all day is described as a coping mechanism *to avoid* killing themselves, not a part of a plan.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""suicide.""
    - This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post does not mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide. It discusses the *thought* of suicide and a coping mechanism to *prevent* it, but no plan to carry it out.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Based on Step 2, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" indicating more than general distress.
    - Based on Step 3, there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and contemplation (""so i dont kill myself"", ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"") without detailing a plan. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die"" is stated twice.
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, self-deprecation (""too much of a coward"").
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned. In fact, the phrase ""too much of a coward to do it"" explicitly indicates a lack of current action or plan.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I want to die"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    - Conclusion: Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present).
    - Does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - The phrase ""I'm too much of a coward to do it"" explicitly states an *absence* of action or a plan, despite the desire.
    - Conclusion: There are no elements of a plan present. This rules out 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post discusses current feelings and perceived inability to act, not a past attempt.
    - Conclusion: This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Step 2 established a clear desire to die, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - Step 3 confirmed the absence of any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. The statement ""I'm too much of a coward to do it"" reinforces the lack of a plan or immediate intent to act.
    - Step 4 confirmed no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes... a clear desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., 'I want to die')... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

Ive planned it all out, this is just a way of dying, knowing somebody noticed, and i feel cared about and worth it for the last few seconds i can ever memorize.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Goodbye"", ""throw myself off a bridge"", ""suicidal since i was 9"", ""self-harmed"", ""dying"", ""my last"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""I cant take it"", ""hated myself"", ""tired of everything around me"", ""at peace, no longer in pain"" (often a sign of resolved decision), ""dont have the confidence to even say a word"".
    - Specific plans: ""throw myself off a bridge"" (specific method and location), ""Ive planned it all out"" (explicit statement of planning), ""locked in the bathroom"" (current location/preparation, implying immediacy), ""my last vent before i littitimatly decide"".
    - Past concrete actions: ""i self-harmed"". This is a past action, but the definition for 'Attempt' requires a ""specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life"" (e.g., ""I overdosed"", ""I tried to cut my wrists""). ""Self-harmed"" alone is too general and doesn't explicitly state it was an *attempt* to end life, rather than a coping mechanism. The post's focus is on the *current* plan.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains ""throw myself off a bridge"" (a direct action to end life), ""suicidal"", ""Goodbye"", ""my last vent"", ""dying"". This clearly indicates a desire to die and explicit suicidal ideation. This is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific **method**: ""throw myself off a bridge"" (jumping).
        - A specific **location**: ""off a bridge"".
        - A specific **timeframe**: Implied immediacy with ""Goodbye"", ""my last vent"", ""last few seconds i can ever memorize"", and being ""locked in the bathroom"".
        - Clear signs of **preparation**: ""Ive planned it all out"", ""locked in the bathroom"".
    - All these elements point strongly to 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post mentions ""i self-harmed"". As discussed in step 1, this phrase, without further detail describing a concrete action taken *to try to end their life*, does not meet the strict definition of 'Attempt' provided (which requires examples like ""I overdosed last year"" or ""when I tried to cut my wrists""). It's a general past behavior, not a described past suicide attempt. The primary focus of the post is on the *current* and *imminent* plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere thoughts by explicitly stating a plan, including a method (""throw myself off a bridge""), a location (""off a bridge""), and a sense of immediate preparation/timeframe (""Goodbye"", ""Ive planned it all out"", ""locked in the bathroom"", ""last few seconds""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - While ""i self-harmed"" is mentioned, it does not meet the specific criteria for 'Attempt' as it doesn't describe a concrete action taken to try to end life. The primary classification should be based on the strongest and most immediate risk indicated, which is the current plan.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm gonna commit suicide,"" ""die of blood loss."" The phrase ""twist my dick off"" is presented as the method for self-harm leading to death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** While not explicitly stated, the content implies severe distress and a desire to end suffering.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method:** ""twist my dick off"" and ""die of blood loss."" This is a specific, albeit unusual, method described.
        *   **Means:** Not explicitly mentioned as acquired, but the method implies using their own body.
        *   **Location:** Not mentioned.
        *   **Timeframe:** ""I'm gonna wait it off"" is vague, not a specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""on my birthday.""
        *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No past actions are described; all language is future-oriented (""I'm gonna"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""I'm gonna commit suicide."" It also expresses a clear desire to die (""die of blood loss""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post mentions a specific **method** for suicide: ""twist my dick off"" leading to ""die of blood loss."" The definition for 'Behavior' states: ""A plan MUST include one or more of the following: a specific method (e.g., 'I'm going to take all these pills,' 'thinking of jumping from the bridge')."" The stated method, even if medically dubious, fulfills this criterion.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. All statements are about future intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states suicidal intent (""I'm gonna commit suicide,"" ""die of blood loss""), which means it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   It includes a clear expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a specific method (""twist my dick off"" leading to ""die of blood loss""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' because a specific method is part of the stated plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""Sayonara"" (a farewell, implying an end), ""I will eventually die in a much painful way"" (could be passive, but in context of distress, it adds to the despair), ""no reason to live"" (clear expression of desire to not be alive).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker,"" ""much painful way,"" ""endured the physical pain and mental depression for years,"" ""I am lonely,"" ""no reason to live."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, chronic pain, and loneliness.
    *   **Specific plans:** No mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), means (e.g., ""I have the rope""), location (e.g., ""that bridge""), specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or preparations (e.g., ""writing notes""). ""Eventually"" is not a specific timeframe.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**

The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis.

    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""I thought of killing myself multiple times.""
    - Yes, there are other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, such as ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" and ""he is the only reason im alive right now,"" which strongly imply a desire to not be alive if not for that reason. ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" also points to a desire for the current suffering to end.
    - Since there are explicit suicide mentions and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post does not mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post describes past *thoughts* (""I thought of killing myself multiple times""), but it does not describe a *specific past concrete action* taken to try to end their life (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). Therefore, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a strong desire not to be alive (""I thought of killing myself multiple times,"" ""he is the only reason im alive right now""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a concrete past action taken to attempt suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits the 'Ideation' category as it contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan.

474,"Where can I find out how to die. I don't care if it's slow or painful or both, I just want to definitely die",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The phrases ""how to die"" and ""definitely die"" are direct mentions of wanting to cease living.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't care if it's slow or painful or both"" indicates extreme despair, hopelessness, and a strong desire to end life, overriding concerns about suffering.
    *   **Specific plans:** The post *asks* ""Where can I find out how to die,"" which indicates the *lack* of a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation) at the moment of posting. The user is seeking information to formulate a plan, not stating an existing one.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No mention of any past actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   The post does not explicitly use ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   However, it contains a very direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die: ""I just want to definitely die"" and ""Where can I find out how to die."" This clearly indicates a desire to die.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses a desire to die. Now check for a plan.
    *   Is there a specific method? No. The user is *asking* for a method.
    *   Are specific means being acquired or possessed? No.
    *   Is a specific location mentioned? No.
    *   Is a specific timeframe mentioned? No.
    *   Are there clear signs of preparation? No.
    *   The core of the post is seeking *information* on how to die, which means a plan is not yet formed or stated. This absence of a concrete plan is crucial.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there's a clear and unambiguous desire to die (""I just want to definitely die"").
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action is described.
    *   It expresses a clear desire to die and suicidal thoughts (""Where can I find out how to die,"" ""I just want to definitely die""). However, it explicitly *lacks* any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation). The phrase ""Where can I find out how to die"" signifies the user is *seeking* a plan, not stating they have one.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings OR a clear desire to not be alive any longer... but WITHOUT any specific plan to commit suicide.""

475,"It Never Quite Goes Away. I stick around for other people, but not because I want to be alive. It's not just that I don't see a future for myself, I just don't really want one either. It does get better, and then it gets worse, and then it gets better, and then worse, etc. I'm tired of buying time from myself over and over again. I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly? Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore. Maybe that's shitty. Maybe it's that 'indifference toward other people' that they were talking about when I got diagnosed with PTSD (still reeling from that one, it never seemed bad enough to me. Turns out not everyone lives in constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation). I just don't care. I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I don't want to be alive,"" ""will to die,"" ""If I do it"" (referring to suicide), ""If I do attempt again.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""tired of buying time,"" ""tired of fighting to heal,"" ""don't care,"" ""constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation,"" ""left alone.""
    - Specific plans: ""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"" (specific timeframe). ""I've made enough plans to look forward to"" (suggests existence of plans, though not detailed).
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""If I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail."" This explicitly states a past attempt has occurred. While it doesn't detail the method, the word ""attempt"" itself, especially with ""again,"" implies a concrete action was taken.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains clear expressions of wanting to die (""I don't want to be alive,"" ""will to die"") and explicit reference to suicide (""If I do it,"" ""If I do attempt again"").
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent is present.
    - The post mentions a specific timeframe for a future act: ""at least a few months out."" This qualifies as a planning element for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post states: ""If I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail."" This directly describes a past concrete action (an ""attempt"") taken by the poster. It's not vague; it confirms a prior attempt.
    - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation (""I don't want to be alive,"" ""will to die"").
    - It includes an element of a plan (a specific timeframe: ""at least a few months out""), which would lean towards 'Behavior'.
    - Crucially, it explicitly states a past concrete action: ""If I do attempt again."" The definition for 'Attempt' specifically states that if a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) AND also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. The phrase ""do attempt again"" strongly implies a concrete action was taken in the past.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""take my life,"" ""imagine myself free from everything,"" ""I simply won't live a comfortable life,"" ""I just want the pain to stop,"" ""use any method aside from a gun to the head,"" ""Going by my plan,"" ""grab a kitchen knife and do it there.""

These show clear signs of hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and anhedonia.
    - Specific plans:
        - Method: ""gun to the head,"" ""grab a kitchen knife.""
        - Means: Implied access to a ""kitchen knife.""
        - Location: ""do it there"" (implies current location, likely kitchen).
        - Specific timeframes: ""For the past week, I haven't thought about anything other than how and when I'm going to take my life."" ""Going by my plan, I still need to wait another 480 days until I'm able to (for the gun)."" ""But I can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there."" The latter indicates an immediate, ongoing timeframe for the knife method, contrasting with the longer-term gun plan.
        - Preparations: No explicit preparations mentioned (e.g., writing notes, giving away things).
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""take my life.""
    - Yes, there are other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die/cease existing, such as ""I just want the pain to stop"" and ""imagine myself free from everything.""
    - Since there are explicit mentions and a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific **method**: ""gun to the head"" (future plan) and ""grab a kitchen knife"" (current temptation/plan).
        - Specific **means**: Implied access to a ""kitchen knife.""
        - A specific **location**: ""do it there"" (implies the current location, likely where the knife is).
        - A specific **timeframe**: ""Going by my plan, I still need to wait another 480 days until I'm able to"" (for the gun method). Crucially, ""But I can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there"" indicates an immediate, active temptation/plan for the knife method. The phrase ""Going by my plan"" explicitly states a plan exists.
    - Yes, there are multiple elements of a plan present (method, means, location, timeframe, and explicit mention of a ""plan"").

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It focuses on current thoughts, temptations, and future/imminent plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's explicit suicidal language and a clear desire to die.
    - It's not 'Ideation' because, in addition to the desire to die, there are specific elements of a plan mentioned: specific methods (""gun to the head,"" ""kitchen knife""), implied means (access to a kitchen knife), an implied location (""there""), and a clear, immediate timeframe for the knife method (""can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted""). The explicit phrase ""Going by my plan"" further confirms the presence of a plan.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action of an attempt is described.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly uses ""kms"" (kill myself) multiple times. It also refers to ""when I do it"" and ""before I go,"" clearly indicating an intent to end their life. ""hangman's noose"" is mentioned as a wallpaper to ""stay on track,"" which is a strong symbolic reference to a suicide method.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Gah but it's so hard,"" ""One of the hardest decisions I've taken in my life,"" ""Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too"" show significant distress and internal struggle.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   **Method:** ""hangman's noose"" wallpaper ""to stay on track"" implies a specific method is being kept in mind or considered.
        *   **Means/Preparations:** ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it."" This is a clear statement of preparation, indicating the poster is taking steps to ensure their mother's financial security before committing suicide. This aligns with ""getting affairs in order"" or ""giving away my things"" as defined under 'Behavior'.
        *   **Location/Timeframe:** Not explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of a past concrete action taken to attempt suicide. ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" refers to overcoming an obstacle *to* committing suicide, not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kms"" (kill myself) and clear expressions of wanting to die (""when I do it,"" ""before I go""). This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, there are elements of a plan. The statement ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" is a clear sign of **preparation** for suicide, which is a key element of the 'Behavior' definition. The ""hangman's noose"" wallpaper used ""to stay on track"" also suggests a specific method is being focused on, even if not explicitly stated as *the* chosen method.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""kms"", ""when I do it"", ""before I go""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past concrete attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The crucial element is the presence of a plan. The statement ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" clearly indicates **preparation** for suicide. This falls directly under the definition of 'Behavior' (e.g., ""getting my affairs in order"" is a form of preparation).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die."" The phrase ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore"" indicates distress and a desire for their current state to end, but the initial ""I want to die"" is direct.

    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I want to die."" This is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die. The later phrase ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore"" shows internal conflict but does not negate the initial clear desire to die.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations? No. There is no mention of how, where, or when the person intends to act, nor any preparations.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly mentions ""committing suicide,"" ""suicide,"" ""desire to die."" Describes past actions: ""took 120 extra strength aspirin pills,"" ""purchased a gun,"" ""chambered my round,"" ""pulled the trigger,"" ""purchased rope,"" ""partial suspension hanging,"" ""went with the plan."" Describes current actions: ""made an exit bag,"" ""exit bag set up,"" ""turned that gas valve.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared me,"" ""panicked,"" ""shock,"" ""lonely,"" ""anxious,"" ""sad,"" ""exhausted,"" ""despair,"" ""numb,"" ""empty.""
    *   **Specific plans/preparations (current):** ""Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly... When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked."" This describes a current, active plan with a specific method (exit bag, gas) and means.
    *   **Past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide:**
        *   ""At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills."" (Concrete action: taking pills with intent to die).
        *   ""At 21, I purchased a gun. ... I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward... when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened."" (Concrete action: acquiring a gun, chambering a round, pulling the trigger with intent to die).
        *   ""Just recently, I purchased rope. ... I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain... I gave up..."" (Concrete action: acquiring rope, going to a location, attempting hanging with intent to die).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""committing suicide,"" ""suicide,"" and a clear ""desire to die."" It also describes active preparation and execution of a suicide method.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post describes a current, active plan with a specific method and means: ""Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly... When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked."" This indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly describes multiple specific past concrete actions the poster took to try to end their life:
        *   Taking 120 aspirin pills at 15.
        *   Purchasing a gun, chambering a round, and pulling the trigger at 21.
        *   Purchasing rope, going to a remote location, and attempting partial suspension hanging recently.
    *   These are all clear descriptions of past concrete actions, qualifying for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and describes a current plan (which would lead to 'Behavior').
    *   However, the post also details *multiple specific past concrete actions* taken to attempt suicide.
    *   According to the definition of 'Attempt': ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'.""
    *   Therefore, despite the presence of a current plan, the detailed descriptions of past concrete attempts make 'Attempt' the most fitting category.

483,Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile. I'm a garbage person who should just end my life for my benefit and the benefit of those around me. I'm just a leech who will never accomplish anything.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""should just end my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile""), worthlessness (""I'm a garbage person,"" ""I'm just a leech who will never accomplish anything"").
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No past concrete actions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the phrase ""should just end my life,"" which is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2, there is suicidal intent. However, the post does not mention a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), specific means being acquired (e.g., ""bought a gun""), a specific location (e.g., ""that bridge""), a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or clear signs of preparation (e.g., ""writing my note""). Therefore, there is no explicit plan.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It expresses a current feeling/belief about ending their life, not a historical event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to end life (""should just end my life""), which means it is more than 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) mentioned, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a specific past concrete action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to end life without a specific plan, the post best fits the 'Ideation' category.

484,I'm about to kill myself. I don't see a reason to live. Life sucks.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm about to kill myself"" (direct language).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't see a reason to live,"" ""Life sucks"" (hopelessness, despair, dissatisfaction).
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method (how), means (what tools), location (where), or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""I'm about to"" indicates immediacy but is not a specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""on my 21st birthday"" as defined for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, it contains an unambiguous expression of wanting to die/not be alive (""I don't see a reason to live"").
    *   Therefore, it is more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses suicidal intent. Now check for a plan:
        *   Specific method? No.
        *   Specific means? No.
        *   Specific location? No.
        *   Specific timeframe? ""I'm about to"" implies immediacy, but it is not a *specific* timeframe like ""tonight,"" ""next week,"" or ""on my 21st birthday"" as required by the 'Behavior' definition. It's a statement of imminent intent rather than a defined plan element.
        *   Clear signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since none of the explicit plan elements (method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparation) are present, it does not strongly suggest 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No, the post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Based on Step 2, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Based on Step 3, while there is a strong sense of immediacy (""I'm about to""), the post lacks any specific method, means, location, or a *specific* timeframe (like ""tonight"" or ""on my birthday"") or preparations required for 'Behavior'. It states the intent and immediacy but not *how* or *where* or *when* in a specific, definable sense.
    *   Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm about to kill myself"") and a clear desire to not be alive (""I don't see a reason to live""), but without any specific plan elements as defined for 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""face death"", ""until i die"", ""if not, well, you know what happened"" (strongly implying death by self-inflicted means).
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm done"", ""I'm too pissed"", ""don't even want to feel good anymore, just gonna embrace the pain"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a desire to end suffering.
    - Specific plans: ""gonna start working out until i die or pass out"". This is presented as a method for self-harm with lethal intent. The ""I'll be back in 12 hours if i survived"" provides a timeframe for the anticipated outcome and reinforces the seriousness of the intent.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"".
    - However, there is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die/cease existing: ""just gonna embrace the pain and face death"", ""gonna start working out until i die"", ""if not, well, you know what happened"" (clearly implying death).
    - Since there is a clear desire to die, it's not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present (from step 2).
    - Does the post mention a specific method? Yes, ""working out until i die or pass out"". While unusual, the intent is clearly described as lethal.
    - Does it mention a specific timeframe? Yes, ""i'll be back in 12 hours if i survived"" implies the action will occur within this timeframe and its outcome will be known.
    - Does it mention means, location, or preparation? Not explicitly beyond the method and implied timeframe.
    - The presence of a specific method (""working out until i die"") and a timeframe (""12 hours if i survived"") with lethal intent strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to try to end their life. It describes a *current* plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a specific method (""working out until i die"") and a timeframe (""12 hours if i survived"") for a self-destructive act with lethal intent. This goes beyond mere thoughts or desires (Ideation) and describes a current plan of action.
    - It does not describe a past concrete attempt.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

I'm sorry for the question but I was hoping someone would be able to talk and help me figure it out.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""contemplated suicide for years,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" ""plan to be dead long before I retire.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses a long-standing, fixed suicidal intent (""I know I am going to do it""), combined with a practical dilemma, indicating deep distress and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   Methods: None mentioned.
        *   Means: None mentioned.
        *   Locations: None mentioned.
        *   Specific timeframes: ""maybe in my 20's or 30's. im unsure how long that will take"". This is a very broad and uncertain age range, not a specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""on my 21st birthday"". The definition of 'Behavior' specifies ""a specific timeframe for the act (e.g., 'I'm ending it tonight,' 'I plan to do it on my birthday,' 'I'll kill myself at 21')"". The given timeframe does not meet this specificity.
        *   Preparations: None mentioned.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""suicide"" and direct phrases like ""I know I am going to do it"" and ""plan to be dead long before I retire,"" which are unambiguous expressions of wanting to die.
    *   This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   The post expresses suicidal intent (from step 2).
    *   Does it mention a specific method, means, location, *specific* timeframe, or preparations? No. The timeframe ""maybe in my 20's or 30's"" explicitly states ""im unsure how long that will take"" and is too broad to be considered a *specific* timeframe for a plan as defined in the 'Behavior' category. There are no other elements of a specific plan.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. It mentions contemplating suicide for years and knowing they will do it in the future, but no description of a past *action*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die and suicidal thoughts (""contemplated suicide for years,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" ""plan to be dead""). This means it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a specific past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post expresses suicidal thoughts and future intent, but it lacks any *specific* plan components (method, means, specific location, *specific* timeframe, or preparations) required for 'Behavior'. The timeframe mentioned is explicitly vague (""unsure how long,"" ""maybe in my 20s or 30s"") and therefore not specific enough for 'Behavior'.
    *   Thus, the best fit is 'Ideation' as it describes clear suicidal thoughts/desire to die without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" This is a direct inquiry about the lethal potential of a specific substance.
    *   Emotional indicators: The context implies distress and a contemplation of ending life.
    *   Specific plans: ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later."" This indicates possession of means (pills) and a future timeframe (""later"") for their use, strongly implying suicidal intent.
    *   Past concrete actions: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? Not explicitly ""kill myself,"" but ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" combined with ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" is a very strong implicit expression of suicidal intent and a desire to die. The user is clearly contemplating using the pills to die.
    *   Therefore, yes, there is a clear desire to die/suicidal intent. This means it's more than 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent is present), does the post also mention:
        *   A specific **method**: Yes, taking duloxetine pills.
        *   Specific **means** being acquired or possessed with intent: Yes, ""I have a few pills that I've been saving"". This indicates possession of the means with intent for future use.
        *   A specific **location**: No.
        *   A specific **timeframe**: ""for later"" - this is a future timeframe, even if not precise.
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: ""saving for later"" implies preparation and intent to use them.
    *   Since there is a specific method (pills), specific means (having the pills), and a timeframe (""later"") with clear intent (asking about lethality), this strongly suggests 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The post refers to current possession and future intent, not a past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (asking about lethality of pills one possesses and is saving).
    *   It contains specific elements of a plan: a specific method (pills), specific means (having the pills), and a timeframe (""for later"").
    *   It does not describe a past concrete action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because it includes the possession of specific means and a clear contemplation of their use for suicide in the future.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I just want to end"" is a clear expression of a desire to cease existing.
    - Emotional indicators: ""stop feeling this way,"" ""It's hell,"" ""I know it isn't me [who cares about my life]. Not anymore,"" ""I feel so empire [empty],"" ""So out of place."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of worthlessness.
    - Specific plans: There are no mentions of a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations. The phrase ""haven't yet"" explicitly states no action has been taken or planned.
    - Past concrete actions: The phrase ""haven't yet"" indicates no past concrete action has been taken.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""I just want to end"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to cease existing/die.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die/cease existing, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present), does the post also mention:
        - A specific method? No.
        - Specific means being acquired or possessed with intent? No.
        - A specific location? No.
        - A specific timeframe? No.
        - Clear signs of preparation? No.
    - The post explicitly states ""haven't yet"", which confirms the absence of a current plan or action. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No. The phrase ""haven't yet"" explicitly states that no action has been taken, negating a past attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to ""end"" (""I just want to end""), which falls under ""a clear desire to not be alive any longer"" as defined in 'Ideation'.
    - It does not contain any specific plan elements (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation), ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - It explicitly states ""haven't yet,"" ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - It expresses more than general distress; it expresses a clear desire to cease existing, ruling out 'Indicator'.

It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    -   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""dead by the end of the day today"", ""off myself"", ""cant off myself"".
    -   **Emotional indicators:** ""Living by procrastination"", ""too tired"", ""fatigue"", ""My brain is my body's worst enemy"". Indicates distress, internal conflict, and a sense of being stuck.
    -   **Specific plans:**
        -   **Method/Means:** ""buy the gas"" (implies a method like self-immolation or carbon monoxide poisoning using gas). This is a specific means/method being considered.
        -   **Timeframe:** ""by the end of the day today"". This is a very specific and imminent timeframe.
        -   Location: Not specified.
        -   Preparations: No explicit preparations, rather the opposite is mentioned (procrastination, too tired to act, not leaving the house).
    -   **Past concrete actions:** No past attempts are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    -   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of wanting to die (""dead by the end of the day today"") and self-inflicted death (""off myself"", ""cant off myself"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    -   Suicidal intent/desire to die is clearly present (from step 2).
    -   The post mentions:
        -   A specific **method/means**: ""buy the gas"" is mentioned as a necessary step to ""off myself"". While not acquired, it's part of the contemplated action.
        -   A specific **timeframe**: ""by the end of the day today"". This is a clear, specific timeframe for the potential act.
    -   The post articulates a hypothetical scenario (""If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today"") which includes a specific timeframe and an implied method/means. The subsequent sentences explain why this plan hasn't been executed (fatigue, not leaving the house to get the means), but the elements of the plan are still articulated. This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which requires a desire to die *and* mention of a specific method, means, location, or timeframe.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    -   No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    -   The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') because it explicitly expresses a desire to die and mentions ""off myself"".
    -   It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because it includes specific elements of a plan: a specific timeframe (""by the end of the day today"") and a specific method/means being considered (""buy the gas""). Even though the poster states they haven't acted on it due to fatigue, the *elements of a plan* are present in their thoughts as described. This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition requiring a desire to die AND mention of a specific method, means, or timeframe.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" and the phrase ""do it"" in a clear suicidal context (""I should stop being a pussy and do it... I should just suck it up and do it already"").
    - Emotional indicators: Frustration, self-criticism, a sense of pressure or urgency to act on suicidal thoughts.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a clear desire to ""do it"" (referring to suicide). This means it is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post does not mention a specific method, means, location, specific timeframe, or preparations for suicide. It's a general statement of intent/desire to act, but without the specifics required for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. The phrase ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to communication, not a physical attempt. ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" refers to a future action, not a past one.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's explicit mention of suicide and a clear desire to act on it.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation).
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no specific past concrete action is described.
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a clear desire to act on them, but without any specific plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself)."" - This is self-harm. The stated intent is ""to calm me down,"" not explicitly to end life.
        *   ""And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January."" - Explicit mention of a past suicide plan (which was not executed).
        *   ""but now it time to stop the lie and end it."" - Clear expression of wanting to end life.
        *   ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" - Explicit current suicide plan.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm done and happy,"" ""big relief,"" ""done with everything,"" ""unmotivated to find motivation,"" ""happy at the same time,"" ""weird feeling."" Despite claiming happiness, the core message is a decision to end life.
    *   **Specific plans:**
        *   ""And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January."" (Past plan, not executed).
        *   ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" - This is a current, detailed plan.
            *   **Method:** ""hang myself,"" ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe.""
            *   **Means/Tools:** ""the rope, the axe and the car.""
            *   **Location:** ""the highest tree of the forest.""
            *   **Timeframe:** ""now it time to stop the lie and end it"" implies immediacy. ""Everything is ready"" reinforces this.
            *   **Preparations:** ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car.""
    *   **Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide:**
        *   ""During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself)."" - This describes a concrete action (cutting), but the stated purpose (""to calm me down"") does not indicate it was an attempt to end life. It's non-suicidal self-injury.
        *   The January plan was explicitly stated as ""But I didn't"" (i.e., not executed).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Yes, the post contains explicit mentions like ""kill myself"" and ""end it,"" and a clear desire to cease existing.
    *   This means it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions a current plan: ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe.""
    *   It includes:
        *   A specific **method**: ""hang myself,"" ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe.""
        *   Specific **means**: ""the rope, the axe and the car.""
        *   A specific **location**: ""the highest tree of the forest.""
        *   Clear signs of **preparation**: ""Everything is ready.""
        *   An implied **timeframe**: ""now it time to stop the lie and end it.""
    *   The presence of these elements strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post describes past self-harm (""cut my rights leg"") but explicitly states it was ""to calm me down,"" not as an attempt to end life. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.""
    *   The mention of ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't"" refers to a past *plan* that was *not executed*, not a past *attempt*.
    *   Therefore, the post does not describe a past suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal intent and a clear desire to die (Step 2).
    *   It also contains a detailed, current plan with method, means, location, and preparations (Step 3). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   While there is past self-harm, it's not described as a suicide attempt, and a past suicide plan was not executed (Step 4). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
    *   The detailed plan differentiates it from 'Ideation'.

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The post mentions ""die"" (""just going to die anyway"", ""don't really want to die""). It also expresses ""I wish I was never born.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""dumbest shit ever,"" ""no point for us being here."" These indicate frustration, hopelessness, and existential despair.
    - Specific plans: None. No method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations.
    - Past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life"": No.
    - Other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing: The phrase ""I wish I was never born"" could suggest a desire not to exist. However, this is immediately and directly contradicted by ""but at the same time don't really want to die."" This explicit statement negates any clear desire to die or end one's life. The post is more about questioning the point of life and expressing general existential distress rather than a desire for self-inflicted death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior): Not applicable, as there is no clear suicidal intent or desire to die.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION: Not applicable, as no past concrete actions are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post lacks explicit suicide terms.
    - Crucially, it lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life because it explicitly states ""don't really want to die.""
    - It contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (""What's the point of living..."", ""I wish I was never born..."", ""no point for us being here"").
    - Based on the definitions, particularly the 'Indicator' definition (""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide AND lacks a clear desire to die or end one's life. There may be general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life... If the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive... it should be 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'.""), this post fits 'Indicator' because the ""don't really want to die"" clause prevents it from being 'Ideation'. It expresses existential angst, not suicidal intent.

493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
    - Emotional indicators: Shame (""I am very ashamed""), fear (""I am afraid of everyone will think of me""), distress (""I really need help,"" ""I know I messed up big time"").
    - Specific plans: None.
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The post expresses significant social anxiety, shame, and regret about a past action and its social consequences, but not a desire to die or cease existing. Phrases like ""What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting"" indicate a plea for advice on how to handle a difficult social situation, not a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no suicidal intent or desire to die expressed.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Not applicable, as there is no description of a specific past concrete action to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress, shame, and fear related to a social situation.
    - It does not contain any explicit mention of suicide or a clear desire to die.
    - It does not describe any specific plan or past attempt.
    - Therefore, it best fits the 'Indicator' category, which covers general expressions of distress, sadness, or dissatisfaction with life without suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""don't let you kill yourself"" is a direct mention of suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""sick of it,"" ""suffer,"" ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"" indicate distress and frustration.
    - Specific plans: No specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation is mentioned.
    - Past concrete actions: No description of any past concrete action taken to attempt suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit phrase ""kill yourself.""
    - Yes, there is an unambiguous expression of wanting to die/cease existing, implied by ""sick of it"" and the desire to ""kill yourself.""
    - Since there is an explicit suicide mention, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post does not mention a specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), specific means being acquired, a specific location, a specific timeframe (""tonight,"" ""at 21""), or clear signs of preparation (e.g., ""writing note,"" ""giving things away"").
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life. It discusses the inability to do so due to family, not a past attempt.
    - Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""kill yourself,"" ""sick of it"") but lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, timeframe, preparation) or description of a past concrete attempt. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""pls fucking end me"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die or cease existing. The phrase ""till i say im going to do it"" strongly implies a future suicidal action.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""lonely,"" ""nobody fucking cares,"" ""Nobody cares ever,"" ""Im such a spoiled piece of shit"" indicate feelings of intense loneliness, worthlessness, despair, and a sense of being uncared for.
    *   **Specific plans:** No specific method (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump""), means (e.g., ""I have the rope""), or location (e.g., ""the bridge"") is mentioned. The phrase ""before the day"" is a timeframe, but it's attached to a plea (""pls fucking end me"") rather than a self-directed plan (""I will end it before the day""). There are no clear preparations.
    *   **Past concrete actions:** No description of any past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:**
    *   Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No direct use of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? Yes, ""pls fucking end me"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of wanting to die. The phrase ""till i say im going to do it"" also clearly refers to a suicidal act.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear desire to die. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):**
    *   Building on step 2 (suicidal intent/desire to die is present):
        *   Specific method: No.
        *   Specific means: No.
        *   Specific location: No.
        *   Specific timeframe for carrying out suicide: ""before the day"" is mentioned, but it's part of a plea (""pls fucking end me before the day""), not a self-directed plan (""I am going to end it before the day""). The phrase ""till i say im going to do it"" is a general reference to a future act, not a specific plan with a timeframe for *their own* action.
        *   Clear signs of preparation: No.
    *   Conclusion: No elements of a specific self-directed plan (method, means, location, specific timeframe for *their own* action, or preparation) are present.

4.  **PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Does the post describe a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Based on Step 2, the post contains a clear desire to die (""pls fucking end me,"" ""till i say im going to do it""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   Based on Step 4, there is no description of a past concrete action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Now, differentiate between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post expresses a clear desire to die and hints at future suicidal action, which aligns with 'Ideation'. However, it lacks any specific plan (method, means, location, specific self-directed timeframe, or preparations) as required for 'Behavior'. The ""before the day"" is a timeframe for a plea, not a self-directed plan. Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I hope it'll be me next"" in the context of stabbings clearly expresses a desire to die. The word ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family"" indicates feelings of being a burden or worthlessness, and a desire to avoid shame associated with suicide.
    - Specific plans: There is no mention of a specific plan for the individual to *commit* suicide themselves (no method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations for a self-inflicted act). The desired method of death (being stabbed) is external.
    - Past concrete actions: No past attempts are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains the explicit word ""suicide"".
    - Yes, there is a clear and unambiguous expression of wanting to die (""I hope it'll be me next"" in the context of deadly stabbings).
    - Since both are 'Yes', it is more than 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - The post expresses a desire for death and mentions ""suicide"" in the context of avoiding shame. However, it does *not* mention a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation for the individual to *commit* suicide themselves. The desired outcome (death by stabbing) is framed as an external event, not a self-inflicted action being planned by the individual. While the desire to die is strong and linked to suicidal thoughts, the criteria for a 'Behavior' classification (a *self-inflicted* plan) are not met.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No, the post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken by the poster to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal language (""suicide"") and a clear desire to die (""I hope it'll be me next""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no description of a past concrete action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - While there is a strong desire to die, there is no specific plan for the individual to *commit* suicide themselves (no self-inflicted method, means, location, timeframe, or preparation). The desired death is external. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - It best fits 'Ideation' because it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings and a clear desire to not be alive, but without a self-inflicted plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all"", ""disappear"" (in the context of suicide).
    - Emotional indicators: ""0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money"" (hopelessness, despair, worthlessness).
    - Specific plans: The post asks ""how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?"" and then elaborates: ""go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it?"". This describes a specific location (""another country"") and preparations (""run from everyone"", ""disappear"", ""another identity"") with the clear intent to facilitate suicide.
    - Past concrete actions: None described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes, the post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""I want to put an end to it all"".
    - Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Suicidal intent/desire to die is present.
    - The post mentions:
        - A specific method: The method is suicide itself, and the post is asking *how* to achieve it through specific actions.
        - Specific means/preparations: ""run from everyone"", ""disappear"", ""have another identity"" are described as preparatory steps to enable the suicide.
        - A specific location: ""another country"" is mentioned as a location to carry out the act.
    - These elements (location, preparation) constitute a plan as defined under 'Behavior'.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - The post does not describe any specific past concrete actions taken to attempt suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It does not describe a past concrete attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - It goes beyond mere ideation by describing a specific plan involving a location (""another country"") and preparations (""run from everyone"", ""disappear"", ""have another identity"") that are intended to facilitate the act of suicide. This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' which includes mentioning a specific method, means, location, timeframe, or preparations.

    - Specific plans: ""I'm gonna try again tonight."" (specific timeframe: ""tonight""). ""I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful."" (indicates a future plan, even if method is vague). ""This is the least pain-proof way I could die."" (implies method consideration).
    - Clear descriptions of past concrete actions: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets."" This is a very clear and detailed description of a past concrete action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Yes. The post explicitly states ""I tried to kill myself,"" ""almost kill myself,"" and ""I'm gonna try again tonight."" It also expresses a clear desire to die (""wanted to as well,"" ""THIS NEEDS TO END"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Yes. The post mentions a specific timeframe for a *current* intention: ""I'm gonna try again tonight."" It also alludes to ""another plan in mind"" (Plan B). This satisfies the criteria for a plan (timeframe).

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes. The post clearly describes a specific past concrete action: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets."" This is a detailed account of what the poster *did*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal intent and a clear desire to die (ruling out 'Indicator').
    - It describes a clear past concrete action taken to end their life (""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets"").
    - The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts (describing a concrete action) and also mentions current plans for suicide, label it as 'Attempt'.""
    - This post perfectly fits this condition, as it describes a past attempt and also mentions current plans (""I'm gonna try again tonight""). Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Just don't want to get out of bed,"" ""soooo tierd,"" ""I just want to sleep 24/7,"" ""I feel empty,"" ""worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔"". These indicate fatigue, anhedonia, emptiness, and concern about depression.
    - Specific plans: None.
    - Past concrete actions: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS / CLEAR DESIRE TO DIE:
    - Does the post contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or very similar direct phrases? No.
    - OR, are there other direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to die, not be alive, or cease existing? No. The phrase ""I just want to sleep 24/7"" indicates extreme fatigue and a wish to escape current feelings through sleep, not a desire to die or cease existing. The overall tone is one of depressive symptoms and worry about their impact, not a desire to end life.
    - Since 'No' to both, the post is likely 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for Behavior):
    - Not applicable, as there is no suicidal intent or clear desire to die expressed.

4. PAST ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION:
    - No description of a specific past concrete action the poster took to try to end their life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress, fatigue, emptiness, and worry about a depressive episode.
    - It does not contain any explicit mentions of suicide or a clear, unambiguous desire to die or cease existing. The desire to ""sleep 24/7"" is indicative of severe fatigue and a wish for escape from current feelings, but not a desire to end life.
    - Therefore, it best fits the 'Indicator' definition, which describes general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with life without explicit suicidal intent or a clear desire to die.
