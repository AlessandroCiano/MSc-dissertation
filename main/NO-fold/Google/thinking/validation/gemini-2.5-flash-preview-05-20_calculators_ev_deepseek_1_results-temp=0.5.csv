0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""ending my life""
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""Never will find love"" (hopelessness), ""mental breakdown"", ""everything in my life is crap even me"" (worthlessness, despair), ""hate being gay and I hate being myself"" (self-loathing).
    *   Specific methods: ""go to a bridge and jump off"" (jumping, specific location).
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: ""Kind of thinking about ending my life *again*."" This indicates recurring suicidal ideation, not a past attempt.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again."" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off."" These are active expressions of desire and intent.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No explicit disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""mental breakdown from the past few weeks"" (context for distress). ""thinking about ending my life *again*"" refers to recurring ideation.
    *   Present intent: ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again."" ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off."" (Current desire/ideation).
    *   Future ideation: ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" implies a future action, but it's a desire, not an immediate plan.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No. ""Thinking about ending my life again"" refers to thoughts, not a past concrete action/attempt.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""ending my life"", ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"").
        *   Specific method: Yes (""go to a bridge and jump off"" - this is a specific method and location, fitting ""jumping location"" under Behavior definition).
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   Since the condition is ""(specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)"", and a specific method is present, this path leads to **BEHAVIOR**.

    *   *Self-correction/Verification*: The Ideation category defines ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"". The method ""go to a bridge and jump off"" is specific and actionable, not non-actionable, which confirms it's beyond Ideation. The Behavior category explicitly lists ""jumping location"" as a specific method. While there's no immediate timeline or preparation, the decision tree states ""explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)"". The presence of explicit intent AND a specific method is sufficient for Behavior.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: None. ""die soon"" is ambiguous and does not explicitly state suicide.
    *   Indirect death references: ""die soon"" - could be natural death, or self-inflicted, but lacks explicit suicide context.
    *   Emotional markers: ""inconsolable"" - indicates high distress, despair, hopelessness.
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I'm going to die soon"" - writer claims ownership of the statement.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? No.
    *   The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" is a statement of perceived future state, not an explicit active desire or intent to commit suicide. It could refer to feeling so overwhelmed that death feels imminent, or a metaphorical death, or even a natural death. It lacks the explicit ""I want to die by suicide"" or ""I will kill myself"".

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: No.
    *   Future ideation: ""soon"" indicates a non-specific future time.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. There is no explicit suicide intent, no method, no preparation, and ""soon"" is not immediate.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. ""I'm going to die soon"" is not an explicit *desire* to die by suicide (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead""). It's a statement about an impending event, which is ambiguous regarding suicide.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts →
        *   ""I'm inconsolable"" clearly indicates distress.
        *   ""I'm going to die soon"" without explicit suicide context fits the *Clarification* for **Indicator**: ""I'm going to die soon"" without explicit suicide context → indicator. This phrase, in isolation, expresses a feeling of impending doom or hopelessness rather than an active suicidal desire or plan.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
*   Writer-focused: Yes.
*   Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable.
*   Immediacy trumps: ""soon"" is not immediate.
*   Rejection downgrade: Not applicable.
*   Output exactly one: Will do.

Based on the framework, particularly the clarification for the **Indicator** category, ""I'm going to die soon"" without explicit suicide context falls under distress without actionable suicide intent.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: None.
    *   Indirect death references: ""I hate living."" - This expresses a strong negative sentiment towards life, implying a desire not to continue living, but not directly stating a wish for death or self-harm.
    *   Emotional markers: ""I hate living."", ""fuck"" - hopelessness, despair, anger, existential distress.
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I hate living."" is an active statement of feeling. ""sometime i think about why i have to live"" is an active thought process.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No explicit disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""sometime i think about why i have to live until now"" describes past/ongoing thoughts.
    *   Present intent: ""I hate living."" describes a present feeling.
    *   Future ideation: No specific future plans mentioned.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No explicit suicide intent (""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself"") is present, nor are methods, preparations, or an immediate timeline. So, not 'BEHAVIOR'.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → The post states ""I hate living."" and ""sometime i think about why i have to live"". While this expresses extreme distress and a negative view of life, it does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead,"" which are the key qualifiers for 'Ideation'. It's more about questioning existence and disliking life rather than actively desiring death. So, not 'IDEATION'.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts →
        *   ""I hate living."" fits ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"".
        *   ""sometime i think about why i have to live"" also fits ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" and existential questioning.
        *   There are NO expressions of *active suicidal desire* (as defined for Ideation).
        *   It is not a rejected thought.
        *   This fits the criteria for 'Indicator'.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: N/A.
3.  Immediacy trumps: N/A.
4.  Rejection downgrade: N/A.
5.  Output exactly one: Yes.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses profound distress, unhappiness with life, and existential questioning, but it lacks an explicit statement of desiring to die or any specific suicidal intent, plan, or immediacy. Therefore, it falls into the 'Indicator' category.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself"" - Yes.
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: The plea implies distress.
    *   Specific methods: ""barbiturates/Nembutal"" - Yes, specific drug class.
    *   Preparations: ""help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal"" - This is actively seeking means, which falls under preparation/capability.
    *   Past actions: None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""Help me kill myself"" - Yes, clear active endorsement of the thought.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: ""Help me kill myself"" implies current desire and intent. The request for help *finding* means suggests an immediate or near-future plan to act.
    *   Future ideation: No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → Yes.
        *   Explicit suicide intent: ""Help me kill myself.""
        *   Specific method: ""barbiturates/Nembutal.""
        *   Preparation: ""Please somebody help me find..."" (seeking means/preparation).
        *   Immediate timeline: The direct plea for help to acquire means implies an imminent desire to act.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** No, because there is clear active suicidal desire, a specific method, and seeking means.
*   **Ideation:** No, because it goes beyond just a wish to die by including a specific method and active steps to acquire means.
*   **Behavior:** Yes.
    *   ""Specific method stated: pills"" (barbiturates/Nembutal are a type of pill).
    *   ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note"" (asking for help to *find* them is a form of preparation/seeking means).
    *   ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"" (The urgent and direct request for help to acquire means implies immediacy of intent to act).
    *   ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"" - The direct plea for help to ""kill myself"" by finding a specific method strongly suggests immediate intent and capability seeking.
*   **Attempt:** No, no past action is described.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, the post is about the writer's intent.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as only one category fits.
3.  Immediacy trumps: The urgency of the request for help to find a specific method points towards 'behavior'.

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""Is there a painless way to die"", ""how to die with certainty and without pain"", ""I want to sleep forever"" (metaphorical for death/ending life).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""I want to sleep forever"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""struggling"", ""unmotivated"", ""feel so sorry for them"", ""selfish"", ""can't get off my lazy ass"", ""world scares me"", ""fear intimacy"", ""feel worthless"", ""tired"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
    *   **Specific methods:** None stated. The phrase ""painless way to die"" is a *desire* for a method, not a specific one (e.g., ""pills"", ""hanging"").
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The user asks ""Is there a painless way to die"" and states ""I want to sleep forever"", indicating a direct, active desire to die. The lack of knowledge (""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain"") is a barrier, not a rejection of the intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal (""but I won't do it""). The uncertainty about *how* to die is a practical limitation, not a rejection of the desire itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** The question ""Is there a painless way to die"" is a present inquiry, but there's no immediate timeline for action (""doing it tonight"").
    *   **Future ideation:** The desire to ""sleep forever"" and the search for a ""painless way to die"" suggest future ideation, contingent on finding a method.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

        *   Specific method: No.
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → Yes. The post expresses a clear wish to die (""want to sleep forever"", ""painless way to die"") but lacks a specific method or an immediate timeline. The phrase ""painless way"" without further detail fits ""non-actionable methods"".
        *   This leads to **IDEATION**.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is clear active suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *are* expressions of active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"". Yes, ""I want to sleep forever"", ""painless way to die"". ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"". Yes. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". Yes.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific method, preparation evidence, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out because there is no description of a past concrete action.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as only ideation is present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as no immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable, as there is no rejection of the suicidal desire. The uncertainty about *how* to die is a barrier, not a rejection of the desire itself.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'ideation'.

**Conclusion:** The post clearly expresses an active desire to die and is seeking information on how to do so painlessly, but without a concrete plan, specific method, or immediate intent to act. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

People do things, but why? they study, work, want to go somewhere in life, but where does the desire come from? I have never experienced that, never. Theres no space for me around these parts, no space. I think i have n incurable disease or something is wrong with my brain, i cant even relate to otehr people that want to shoot their heads off like me. Im damaged. I cant feel nothing ive been falling down this void for like 5 or 6 years and i havent cried once, just once. All i know is that i want to call it a day and kill myself for the sake of my family. Ive seen the way they talk about me and while its not malicius or anything like that its obvious they try to not talk about me. I think theyre gonna be better off without me, everyone is going to be better without me. Im too weird, my face is weird, my demeanor is weird. Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant if there was a button i could press that would erase all traces of my existence i wouldnt even doubt it, id go for it. But these things dont exist, so either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids. i dont know, i wouldnt know, im damaged",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kill myself"", ""want to die now, right now in this instant"", ""erase all traces of my existence""
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""call it a day"", ""they're gonna be better off without me"", ""everyone is going to be better without me""
    *   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness (""no today, nor tommorrow"", ""stuck, stagnant"", ""no space for me""), worthlessness (""Im too weird, my face is weird, my demeanor is weird"", ""Im damaged""), unbearable pain (""falling down this void for like 5 or 6 years and i havent cried once"")
    *   **Specific methods:** ""run towards a cop with a knife"", ""find a dealer with some opioids"" (these are presented as potential, specific means).
    *   **Preparations:** None explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""I have a knife"", ""I found a dealer""). The methods are hypothetical options.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""I want to call it a day and kill myself"", ""Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant"". The desire is clearly owned by the writer.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No. The statement ""i cant even relate to otehr people that want to shoot their heads off like me"" indicates an inability to relate to *their specific method*, not a rejection of suicide itself. The overall tone is one of strong desire.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I want to call it a day and kill myself"", ""Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant"". This indicates a strong, immediate desire.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids"" - these are presented as potential actions stemming from the immediate desire, suggesting consideration of *how* to act.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""kill myself"", ""want to die now"").
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, specific methods are being considered (""run towards a cop with a knife"", ""find a dealer with some opioids""). While presented as options, they are concrete methods.
        *   **Preparation:** No explicit preparation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes, definitively (""now, right now in this instant"").

    **Applying Category Definitions and Irreducible Rules:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is clear, active suicidal desire.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is explicit desire, there is also an immediate timeline (""now, right now"") and specific methods being considered. The Ideation definition states ""No preparation or immediate timeline"".
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past concrete action.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits.
        *   ""Intent + Capability"": Strong intent is present. Capability is implied by the consideration of specific methods.
        *   ""Specific method stated"": Yes, ""knife"", ""opioids"".
        *   ""Imminent timeline"": Yes, ""now, right now in this instant"". This is a critical factor.
        *   The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior is highly relevant: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"". Here we have ""want to die now, right now in this instant"" *and* specific methods being considered.

    The combination of strong, immediate suicidal intent and the consideration of specific means aligns best with the **Behavior** category.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

""The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it."" (This explicitly refers to the act of ending one's life, contemplating the physical consequences).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""deteriorating"", ""not working anymore"" (general decline, but not direct death references).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""not working anymore"", ""haven't slept in weeks"", ""all I see and think are people are going to hurt me"", ""deteriorating"", ""can't tell anyone"", ""refuse to be sent back to a mental hospital against my will"" (extreme distress, paranoia, hopelessness, fear, isolation, feeling trapped).

    *   **Preparations:** None stated.
    *   **Past actions:** None stated.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I just want to get it over with."" (This is an active, explicit desire to end the current state/life). ""if I go through with it"" (This shows contemplation of taking action).
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal of the desire. The fear is of the *pain* associated with the act (""The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it""), not a rejection of the desire to ""get it over with."" This indicates a barrier to action, but not a disavowal of the underlying ideation.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

    *   **Present intent:** ""I just want to get it over with."" (Present desire).
    *   **Future ideation:** ""if I go through with it"" (Contemplation of a future action, but without a specific timeline).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""I just want to get it over with"" and ""if I go through with it.""
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   *Conclusion for b):* Does not meet the full criteria for BEHAVIOR as it lacks method, preparation, or immediacy.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, ""I just want to get it over with"" is an explicit desire to end suffering/life. The contemplation of ""going through with it"" reinforces this.
        *   Non-actionable methods: The post discusses the *pain* of ""going through with it,"" implying an action, but without specifying *how*, making it non-actionable in terms of a plan.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes, this is true.
        *   *Conclusion for c):* This aligns perfectly with IDEATION. There is clear, active suicidal desire and contemplation of the act, but without a concrete plan, specific method, or immediate timeline.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No. The post contains active suicidal desire (""I just want to get it over with"") and contemplation of the act (""if I go through with it""), which goes beyond mere distress or rejected thoughts. The fear of pain is a deterrent to action, not a rejection of the desire itself.

**Final Check against Category Definitions:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* active suicidal desire (""I just want to get it over with"").
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'..."" fits ""I just want to get it over with."" ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" fits. The contemplation of ""pain if I go through with it"" further solidifies this as active consideration of the act without a concrete plan.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of past action.

The phrase ""I just want to get it over with"" combined with ""if I go through with it"" clearly indicates active suicidal desire and contemplation, but without the actionable components (method, preparation, immediacy) that would elevate it to Behavior.

    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? Yes. The post is primarily about general unhappiness, hopelessness about relationships, despair, and contains a metaphorical expression of wanting to escape oneself (""I'd leave myself if I could"") which signifies deep emotional pain and self-rejection, but not active suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator**: Fits perfectly. Contains general unhappiness, hopelessness, despair, and a metaphorical ""death reference"" (""I'd leave myself if I could"") which is about escaping one's own painful state rather than literal suicide. There are NO expressions of active suicidal desire.

4.  **Rejection downgrade:** ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator. The post says ""I want to die"" (active desire) but ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon"" (rejection of *action* for the near future). The ""Indicator"" definition states ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire."" Since the post *does* express active suicidal desire (""I want to die""), it does not fit the Indicator category perfectly, even with the rejection of immediate action. The rejection here is of *acting* on the desire, not of the *desire itself* (as implied by ""I don't actually want to"").
5.  **Output exactly one:** Yes.

**Conclusion:**
The post explicitly states an active desire to die (""I want to die"") but clearly indicates a lack of immediate plan or timeline (""not any time soon"", ""5 more years""). This perfectly aligns with the definition of **Ideation**. While there is a rejection of immediate action, the active desire to die is still present, which distinguishes it from an ""Indicator"" based on the provided definitions and rules.

Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → NO. (The ""tried over and over again"" refers to jobs, not suicide).
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: YES (""only way out is suicide"", ""considered hanging"", ""make my escape"").
        *   Specific method: YES (""hanging"").
        *   Preparation: NO.
        *   Immediate timeline: NO.
        *   **Crucial point:** The presence of a specific method (""hanging"") would normally push this towards BEHAVIOR if actionable. However, the post explicitly states, ""I don't really have the guts to do it,"" ""I can't seem to go through with it,"" and ""but I don't have the guts."" This negates the *actionability* of the specific method from the writer's perspective.

    *   Let's evaluate against the definitions:
        *   **Indicator:** ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" or ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"". This post *does* express active suicidal desire (""only way out is suicide"", ""make my escape""). While there's a rejection of *acting* on it, it's not a rejection of the *desire* itself or an intrusive thought. So, not Indicator.
        *   **Ideation:** ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan"". This fits perfectly. The writer has an active desire for suicide (""only way out is suicide"", ""make my escape"") and has considered a specific method (""hanging""), but explicitly states they lack the ""guts"" or ability to ""go through with it,"" making it *not actionable* from their perspective. There is no preparation or immediate timeline.
        *   **Behavior:** Requires ""Intent + Capability"" (specific method *and* preparation *or* imminent timeline). While a specific method is mentioned, the explicit lack of ""guts"" or ability to ""go through with it"" means the perceived *capability* to act on it is absent, and there's no preparation or immediate timeline. So, not Behavior.
        *   **Attempt:** Not applicable as no past action is described.

    *   The core distinction here is between desiring suicide and having a method in mind, versus having the perceived capability to act on it. The writer clearly desires suicide and has a method in mind, but explicitly states they are unable to act on it. This aligns with Ideation.

*   **Indirect death references:** None.
*   **Emotional markers:** Implied hopelessness/despair (""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"").
*   **Specific methods:** Not explicitly stated, but ""how"" is mentioned as a decision point.
*   **Preparations:** ""i already got my suicidal notes ready."" This is a concrete preparation.
*   **Past actions:** None described.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""i already know i'm going to kill myself and i've decided on it."" This is a clear, active, and firm endorsement of suicidal intent.
*   **Passive experience:** No indication of intrusive or passive thoughts.
*   **Rejection noted?** No rejection or disavowal.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""already know"", ""already got"".
*   **Present intent:** ""decided on it"".
*   **Future ideation:** ""just a matter of when and how."" The phrase ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"" sets a firm, though not immediate (like 'tonight'), future timeline for the action.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""i already know i'm going to kill myself and i've decided on it"").
    *   **Specific method/preparation:** Yes, ""i already got my suicidal notes ready"" is clear evidence of preparation.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** While ""within a year"" isn't ""tonight,"" the presence of preparation is sufficient to qualify for Behavior. The definition for Behavior explicitly includes ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note"".

This post clearly demonstrates active suicidal desire, a firm decision, and concrete preparation (suicidal notes). These elements align perfectly with the ""Behavior"" category.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None. The post focuses on self-loathing and a desire for transformation (""wish I could press a button and be someone else"").
    *   **Indirect death references:** None. ""Wish I could press a button and be someone else"" is a wish to escape current identity/body, not a wish for death.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""sick of seeing my face,"" ""tired of having to get dressed and seeing my body,"" ""feel so ugly and horrible,"" ""hate everything about myself,"" ""still look disgusting."" These clearly indicate intense distress, self-hatred, body dysmorphia, and hopelessness regarding self-image.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** ""dyed and cut my hair, ive started doing more makeup, i got new clothes, i ate less, and i ate more"" are past actions related to trying to change appearance, not past suicide attempts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer actively expresses strong negative feelings about their appearance and a desire to be someone else. However, this desire is for *transformation* (""be someone else""), not for *death*.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** Not applicable to suicide, as no suicidal thoughts are present to be rejected.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes past attempts to alter appearance.
    *   **Present intent:** Expresses current feelings of disgust with self and a wish to be different.
    *   **Future ideation:** None related to suicide.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No. There is no explicit suicide intent.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No. The post expresses a desire to ""be someone else,"" which is distinct from a desire to die. There is no mention of wanting to die.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post is overwhelmingly focused on distress, self-hatred, and body image issues. It contains general unhappiness, hopelessness, and despair. There are *NO* expressions of active suicidal desire, no death metaphors, and no rejected suicidal thoughts (because no suicidal thoughts are present).

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no suicide elements are present.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable.
*   **Output exactly one:** Will do.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses significant distress, self-hatred, and a desire to escape the current self, but it lacks any direct or indirect mention of suicide, death, or self-harm with suicidal intent. It fits the definition of ""Indicator"" as it describes ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" with ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire.""

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: The post mentions ""kill themselves"" and ""hurt themselves,"" but these refer to *other* people who might post about suicide, not the writer themselves.

    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The writer is asking a question and stating an opinion about *others'* intent, not their own.
    *   Passive experience: Not applicable.

    *   Present intent: None from the writer.
    *   Future ideation: None from the writer.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No. The writer is not expressing their own intent.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No. The writer is not expressing their own desire.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** This is the only remaining option. However, the post does *not* express the *writer's* distress, metaphors, or rejected thoughts. It is a meta-commentary on the behavior of *other* users.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** This rule is critical here. The post is entirely focused on the actions and motivations of *other* people who might post about suicide. The writer is not expressing any personal suicidal ideation, behavior, or distress.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no suicidal content from the writer.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable to the writer's own thoughts.
5.  **Output exactly one:** I must choose one category.

**Conclusion:**
Based strictly on the ""Writer-focused"" rule and the definitions, this post does *not* contain any suicidal content from the writer themselves. It is a discussion *about* suicide, but not an *expression* of suicide risk by the author. None of the categories (Indicator, Ideation, Behavior, Attempt) truly fit the *writer's* state as defined.

However, the task requires outputting exactly one category. If a post mentions suicide in any context, and does not fit higher-risk categories for the *writer*, the 'indicator' category is the most benign and serves as a default for posts that touch on the topic without expressing personal risk. While the 'indicator' definition primarily focuses on the *writer's distress*, in a forced-choice scenario where no personal risk is present, it's the least incorrect option to acknowledge the topic's presence without attributing personal suicidal intent or action to the author.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""My desire to kill myself has not [died down]"", ""Killing myself is painful"", ""getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape"" (metaphorical, but strong suicidal connotation of wanting an immediate, violent end).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""just want out of that tunnel"" (implies desire to escape current life/pain).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""rage"", ""no reason to live"", ""little motivation... ripped from your hands"", ""brutally destroyed"", ""hardest I think I may have ever fought"", ""recoil... hit me in the face even harder"", ""shit just gets more fucked up"", ""don't care anymore"", ""painful"". These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and unbearable pain.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""overdose"" (in the context of past attempts), ""getting hit by an incoming train"" (as a means of escape, implying a violent end).
    *   **Preparations:** None explicitly stated for a *new* immediate attempt.
    *   **Past actions:** ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months"". This is a direct statement of past suicide attempts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""My desire to kill myself has not [died down]"", ""I'd honestly choose that at this point."" (referring to getting hit by a train). The writer clearly owns these thoughts and desires.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No. The contemplation of pain (""Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore."") suggests a *lack* of rejection, moving towards acceptance of the pain for the sake of escape.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months."" This is a clear description of past actions.
    *   **Present intent:** ""My desire to kill myself has not [died down]"", ""I'd honestly choose that at this point."" (Strong current desire for an end, but no *new* immediate plan or timeline for an *additional* attempt).
    *   **Future ideation:** Not explicitly stated as future-only; the desire is current.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → **YES**. The post explicitly states: ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months"".

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all actions and feelings described belong to the writer.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since past attempts are explicitly described, this takes precedence over the current strong ideation.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While there's strong current desire for an end (""I'd honestly choose that at this point""), there isn't a *new* specific plan with an immediate timeline for *another* attempt. The primary classification is driven by the explicit past attempts.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal thoughts or desires.
5.  **Output exactly one:** The presence of concrete past attempts is the defining factor.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post contains explicit descriptions of past suicide attempts (""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months""). According to the framework's ""Attempt"" definition, this category is for ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" and ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned."" While there is also clear current suicidal ideation and intense distress, the direct mention of past attempts immediately places this post in the ""Attempt"" category due to the temporal hierarchy rule.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""I can't live without estrogen"" - This is a strong statement of dependency and inability to cope, implying life would be unbearable without it, but not an explicit death reference or desire to die. It's a statement about a condition for living.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""very worried"", ""fucking horrified"", ""keep crying"", ""panic attacks"", ""too much"", ""I'm going insane"", ""so fucking scared"". These clearly indicate significant distress, overwhelm, and fear.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The post expresses extreme distress and feeling overwhelmed (""its just too much"", ""I'm going insane""). The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" indicates a profound dependency and a feeling that life would be impossible or unbearable without it. However, it is *not* an explicit statement of active suicidal desire (""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself""). It's a statement about a critical condition for their well-being and ability to function, and the fear of losing it.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts, but importantly, no explicit endorsement either. The focus is on the overwhelming problems and fears.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None related to suicide.
    *   **Present intent:** The distress and feeling of being overwhelmed are present. The ""can't live without estrogen"" is a present feeling of dependency.
    *   **Future ideation:** None related to suicide.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No explicit suicide intent. The post describes overwhelming distress and a feeling of being unable to cope without a specific factor (estrogen), but it does not state a desire to die, a method, preparation, or immediate timeline for suicide.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No. The post does not contain phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I don't deserve to live."" The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" is a statement of extreme dependency and distress, implying that life would be unbearable *under those specific circumstances*, but it does not explicitly state a desire to end one's life. It's a cry of desperation about a life-sustaining element, not a direct suicidal wish.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** This fits best. The post is overwhelmingly focused on general unhappiness, hopelessness, despair, and being overwhelmed by problems (""too much"", ""going insane"", ""so fucking scared""). ""I can't live without estrogen"" functions as an extreme expression of distress and inability to cope with a specific situation, rather than an active suicidal desire. It's a statement about a condition for living, not a direct wish for death.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt/behavior).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable (no immediate intent).
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable (no explicit suicidal thought to reject).
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses profound distress, fear, and a feeling of being overwhelmed by current problems and dependencies. While ""I can't live without estrogen"" is a serious statement of desperation, it falls short of being an explicit statement of active suicidal desire (""I want to die""). It describes a condition under which the writer feels they *cannot* continue living, rather than an active intention or wish to die. Therefore, it aligns with the 'Indicator' category, which covers distress without actionable suicide intent.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** Yes. The phrase ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" explicitly describes past suicide attempts.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all statements are about the writer.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since past attempts are explicitly mentioned, this category takes precedence over the current intent (which would otherwise be Behavior).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While ""Now it's time to end it"" indicates immediacy, the explicit mention of *past attempts* (""I tried... and I tried again"") overrides it due to the temporal hierarchy (Attempt being the highest).

5.  **Output exactly one:** Confirmed.

**Conclusion:** The post clearly describes multiple past suicide attempts (""I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more.""). Although there is also current intent (""Now it's time to end it""), the ""Attempt"" category takes precedence due to the defined hierarchy.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday."" This is an active, recurring thought.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not presented as intrusive thoughts (e.g., ""my brain tells me""). It's ""I am thinking.""
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""Everyday I am trying to survive."" This is a crucial statement. It indicates a struggle *against* the suicidal thoughts and an active effort to cope/stay alive. While it's not a full, explicit rejection like ""I don't want to do it,"" it shows a protective factor and an ongoing fight for survival. However, it doesn't negate the *presence* of the daily suicidal thoughts.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None related to suicidal actions.
    *   **Present intent:** ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday."" (Ongoing present ideation).
    *   **Future ideation:** None explicitly.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" fits explicit suicidal desire/preoccupation. There is no plan or immediacy.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → The phrase ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" is a direct, active expression of suicidal thought, which goes beyond mere distress or fully rejected thoughts. While ""Everyday I am trying to survive"" indicates resistance, it doesn't fully negate the active and persistent nature of the suicidal thoughts. The framework's definition of ""Indicator"" for rejected thoughts is ""brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to."" The post's phrasing is ""I am thinking about suicide everyday,"" which is more active, followed by a statement of struggle (""trying to survive""), not a complete disavowal of the thought itself. The core of the statement is the daily contemplation of suicide.

    **Irreducible Rules Check:**
    *   Rule 1 (Writer-focused): Adhered to.
    *   Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy): Not applicable as only ideation is present.
    *   Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps): Not applicable.
    *   Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade): The ""trying to survive"" is a form of resistance, but it doesn't fully negate the *active, daily thinking about suicide*. It's not a clear ""I don't actually want to"" that would downgrade it to Indicator. The continuous ""thinking about suicide everyday"" remains the primary active component.

    Based on the definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire."" This post *does* express active suicidal desire/preoccupation (""thinking about suicide everyday"").
    *   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die' ... No preparation or immediate timeline."" ""Thinking about suicide everyday"" is a strong, active preoccupation with suicide, akin to an explicit wish, without a plan or immediacy.

    Therefore, the presence of daily, active suicidal thoughts, despite the struggle to survive, places this post in the Ideation category.

24,"What's the use. I'm just about 22 and over the past 3 years I've dropped out of college and cut almost all of my friends off. I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family but I've given up in life and spend my time drinking and smoking which has made me gain 25 lbs. Haven't gotten laid in a year and a half. There is no hell so I'm not scared to die. I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April. For some life may end up getting better but  for me it doesn't. Good luck to the rest of you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""not scared to die"" (implies willingness/desire to die).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""given up in life"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""What's the use"", ""given up in life"", ""doesn't get better for me"" (hopelessness, despair).
    *   **Specific methods:** Not explicitly stated, but ""I have a plan"" strongly implies one.
    *   **Preparations:** ""note"" (writing a suicide note), ""plan"" (implies specific steps/means).
    *   **Past actions:** None related to suicide attempts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I'm not scared to die. I have a plan, note and date..."" The writer clearly owns these thoughts and actions.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No. The past statement ""only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family"" is presented as a past reason for *not* acting, but the current statement ""I have a plan, note and date"" indicates this restraint is no longer holding.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""over the past 3 years I've dropped out..."", ""only decided to keep living..."" (describes past circumstances and past reasons for living).
    *   **Present intent:** ""I have a plan, note and date"" (current state of readiness).
    *   **Future ideation:** ""early April"" (specific, relatively imminent future timeline).

        *   **Imminent timeline:** ""early April"" is a specific and relatively imminent timeline.
        *   This combination clearly points to **Behavior**.

    *   **Category Definition Check:**
        *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to active intent, plan, and date.
        *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there's a specific plan, note, and date, which goes beyond mere desire.

        *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempt is described.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        *   1. Writer-focused: Yes.
        *   2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt mentioned, so Behavior is the highest applicable.

25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care. If it happens it happens. My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kill myself"", ""actually do go through with it and kill myself"", ""end up dead in a gutter one day"", ""This will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.""
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""hopefully forever"" (in an institution), ""stay on the inside the rest of my days"", ""no one would care or miss me"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""suicidal thoughts have just been too much"", ""anger is worse than ever"", ""constantly on edge"", ""no family anyway"", ""I don't care. If it happens it happens."" (resignation/hopelessness).
    *   **Specific methods:** No specific method for suicide is stated. ""cuts I have all over myself"" indicates past self-harm, but not explicitly a past *suicide attempt* (intent not specified for those cuts).
    *   **Preparations:** No preparations for suicide are mentioned. The speaker states, ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet.""
    *   **Past actions:** ""cuts I have all over myself"" describes past self-harm. This is not explicitly stated as a *suicide attempt* (i.e., self-harm *with suicidal intent*). It's more a description of their current physical state due to past actions.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The speaker presents a clear choice: ""So it's either I walk into an ER... or I actually do go through with it and kill myself."" This shows active consideration and ownership of the suicidal thought as a potential action. ""I'm going to kill myself"" is stated as a direct option.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently"" describes the thoughts as overwhelming, but the subsequent framing is an active choice.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of suicide. The debate is between seeking help and acting on suicide, not rejecting suicide itself. The ""goodbye"" reinforces potential intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""cuts I have all over myself"" refers to past self-harm, but not a past *suicide attempt* as defined (no explicit suicidal intent for those cuts).
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet."" This indicates a current, active dilemma. The phrasing ""This will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" strongly implies an imminent timeline for a decision and potential action.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""could one day lead to me being sent to prison"", ""end up dead in a gutter one day"" are future possibilities, but the core of the post is the immediate dilemma.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. While ""cuts I have all over myself"" indicates past self-harm, the post does not specify that these cuts were made *with suicidal intent*, which is required for the ""Attempt"" category. It's a description of their current physical state.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""actually do go through with it and kill myself"".
        *   **Specific method/Preparation:** No specific method for suicide is stated, nor any preparation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes. The phrase ""This will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" strongly implies an imminent timeline. The speaker is actively debating between two *immediate* courses of action: going to the ER or ""actually do go through with it."" This fits the ""Behavior"" category's critical expansion: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" The ""goodbye"" signals an immediate, potentially final, decision.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** This is not the case because of the strong implication of immediacy (""last post ever. Goodbye."") and the active, present debate between two immediate options.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear active suicidal intent.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all analysis is on the writer's statements.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No clear past attempt, so this doesn't apply to override.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** The strong implication of immediacy (""last post ever. Goodbye."") combined with active intent points to Behavior.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** There is no rejection of suicide; it's presented as a viable option.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output one category.

The combination of explicit suicidal intent and the strong implication of an immediate timeline (""This will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."") elevates this from Ideation to Behavior, even without a specific method or preparation. The speaker is actively weighing an immediate choice between seeking help and acting on suicide.

    *   Past actions: ""I told someone that im suicidal"" (disclosure, not an attempt).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I can't kill myself"" implies a desire to do so, but an inability to act. ""I know a good clif"" and ""its possible to get there"" show active consideration of a specific plan. ""I told someone that im suicidal"" is an active statement of intent.
    *   Passive experience: ""maybe its my brain playing with me"" refers to their belief in others' care, not a rejection of the suicidal thoughts themselves.
    *   Rejection noted?: The phrases ""can't kill myself"" and ""can't commit to it"" indicate an *inability* to act or ambivalence, but not a *rejection* of the suicidal desire or plan. The desire and the specific plan elements are still present.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""I told someone that im suicidal"" (historical disclosure).
    *   Present intent: ""Im so tired i can't kill myself"", ""I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there, i just can't commit to it."" (Current struggle with a specific, considered plan).
    *   Future ideation: Not explicitly stated, but the present struggle implies ongoing ideation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""suicidal"", ""can't kill myself"" implies desire).
        *   Specific method: Yes (""a good clif"" - jumping location).
        *   Preparation: Yes (""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there"" - scouting/evaluating feasibility of reaching the location for the method).
        *   Immediate timeline: No (""i just can't commit to it"" indicates lack of immediate action).

    **Applying Category Definitions:**
    *   **Indicator**: Ruled out because there *are* expressions of active suicidal desire and a specific plan.
    *   **Ideation**: ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". This post *does* have a specific method (""clif"") and elements of preparation/scouting (""possible to get there""). Therefore, it goes beyond simple ideation.
    *   **Behavior**: ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"" (Yes, ""clif""). ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note"" (Yes, ""possible to get there"" indicates scouting/evaluation of a specific location for the method). ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"" (No, ""can't commit to it"" negates this).
        *   According to the Behavior definition, meeting *any* of the three criteria (specific method, preparation, OR imminent timeline) qualifies. This post meets the ""Specific method stated"" and ""Preparation evidence"" criteria, even without an imminent timeline. The ""can't commit to it"" indicates ambivalence or current inability to act, but the concrete planning elements are present. This represents ""Intent + Capability"" (the capability being the specific method and knowledge of its feasibility), even if execution is currently stalled.

    **Irreducible Rules Check:**
    *   Writer-focused: Yes.
    *   Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable.
    *   Immediacy trumps: Not applicable (no immediacy).
    *   Rejection downgrade: Not applicable. The ""can't commit to it"" is inability, not rejection of the desire.

    The presence of a specific method (""clif"") and the assessment of its feasibility (""its possible to get there"") elevate this beyond mere ideation to a concrete plan, even if the individual is currently struggling with execution. This aligns with the ""Behavior"" category.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

*   **Future ideation:** No specific future timing.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **Start here →**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born"" indicate a desire for an end to life/existence.
    *   Specific method/preparation: No.
    *   Immediate timeline: No.
    *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
    *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born"" fit this description, indicating a desire for non-existence or an end to life.
    *   Non-actionable methods: The desire is present without a specific method.
    *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Confirmed.
    *   This fits the IDEATION criteria.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because the phrases ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born"" go beyond general distress or metaphor; they express an active desire for an end to life/existence, which is a form of active suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are expressions of active suicidal desire (""want it all to stop"", ""wish I was never born"").
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"". The phrases ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born"" strongly align with an explicit wish for non-existence or an end to life. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" is true. This is the best fit.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to lack of past action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no higher categories are present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection present.

The core phrases ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born,"" in the context of overwhelming despair, indicate an active desire for an end to life/existence without a plan or immediate intent, which aligns perfectly with Ideation.

""Can't wait"" expresses strong desire for it to happen, but not a definite plan for *imminent* action. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior specifically states ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify."" ""Can't wait"" falls short of this explicit immediacy.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → This fits. There is an explicit wish to die (""kill myself""), but no specific method, preparation, or *explicit* immediate timeline.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses clear, active suicidal desire (""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"") but lacks a specific method, preparation, or an *explicit* immediate timeline that would elevate it to ""Behavior.""

        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""end it all"", ""goodbye everybody"").
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" strongly implies a specific method is known, which fits ""specific method stated"" (even if not named). ""I'm ready"" implies preparation.

    *   **Evaluating against ""Behavior"" definition:**

        *   ""Preparation evidence"": Yes, implied by ""I'm ready"".
        *   ""Imminent timeline"": No.
        *   The Behavior category states ""Intent + Capability"" and lists ""Specific method stated"" OR ""Preparation evidence"" OR ""Imminent timeline"". Since the post contains both implied specific method and implied preparation, it meets the criteria for ""Behavior"" despite the non-immediate timeline. The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation (""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"") indicates immediacy is *sufficient* for Behavior, but not *necessary* if other capability elements are present.

    *   **Evaluating against ""Ideation"" definition:**
        *   ""Explicit wish to die"": Yes.
        *   ""Non-actionable methods"": No, ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" implies an actionable method.
        *   ""No preparation or immediate timeline"": The post implies preparation (""I'm ready"") and a known method, even if the timeline is not immediate. This goes beyond mere ideation.

    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of strong active intent, a known (though unstated) method, and a declared state of readiness (""I'm ready"") pushes this beyond Ideation into Behavior, even with a delayed timeline. The capability aspect is present.

    *   **Emotional markers:** ""burden"", ""disappointment"", ""they hate me"", ""everything wrong with the world"", ""My existence screws up everyone's lives"", ""Nothing."" (Indicates extreme hopelessness, worthlessness, self-loathing).
    *   **Specific methods:** ""I hold the blade"" (implies a cutting method).
    *   **Preparations:** ""I hold the blade"" (implies acquiring/having the means and physically engaging with them).
    *   **Past actions:** ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it for what! I should be able to!"" This describes an *interrupted* or *aborted* attempt. The individual possessed the means, engaged with them with suicidal intent, but did not complete the act. This aligns with the ""Attempt"" definition's clarification.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, the writer explicitly states ""I can't even fucking kill my self"" and expresses a desire to do so (""I should be able to!"", ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"").
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** No. The statement ""but can't fucking do it"" is a frustration at the *inability* to act, not a rejection of the desire to die. The subsequent ""I should be able to!"" reinforces the active desire for suicide.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""I've been a burden my whole life"", ""my past is still there"" (general background).
    *   **Present intent:** ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" describes a current or very recent, ongoing struggle/action with the means.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **Start here →**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** Yes. The phrase ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" directly describes an *interrupted/aborted attempt*. The ""Attempt"" definition explicitly includes ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped')"". Holding the blade with the intent to ""kill myself"" and failing to complete the act fits this criterion. This is a concrete action taken towards self-harm, even if not completed.

    *   Therefore, the classification is **ATTEMPT**.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all content is about the writer's own thoughts and actions.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. An aborted attempt is described, placing it in the 'Attempt' category.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While there's no explicit ""tonight,"" the description of holding the blade indicates a very present or recent action. However, the ""Attempt"" classification takes precedence due to the nature of the described action.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal desire is present. The inability to act is stated, but the desire remains and is even reinforced (""I should be able to!"").
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"" - This is a direct, albeit rhetorical, expression of the thought of dying by suicide.
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""depressed 16 year old"", ""stripping yourself of individuality"", ""playing within their comfort zone"", ""People love plastic, and people love plastic people"" - indicate profound despair, feelings of worthlessness, lack of acceptance, and alienation.

    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal. The rhetorical question ""is that what you ask for?"" implies a desperate challenge or plea, not a rejection of the suicidal thought itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""killing myself will happen"", ""taking my own life"", ""will not live to see my 40th birthday"" (implies self-termination).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""no hope"", ""all is lost"", ""pointless, meaningless, and a waste of energy to even keep trying.""
    *   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness, despair, fatalism.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** ""I have this on my computer wallpaper now. It is my daily reminder that killing myself will happen."" This indicates a strong mental commitment and reinforcement, but not a concrete preparation of *means* (e.g., acquiring pills, scouting a location).
    *   **Past actions:** ""At least I DID try"" refers to trying to live/cope, not a past suicide attempt.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life."" This is a definitive statement of personal intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No. The post dismisses any possibility of intervention (""Nothing anyone can do or say can save my life save for someone putting $1,000,000 in my bank account or if I were to win the lottery,"" which is presented as an impossible condition).

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""At least I DID try"" (refers to coping, not an attempt).
    *   **Present intent:** ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life."" This is a present confirmation of future intent.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""When it will happen I am unsure, but I do know that I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)."" This indicates a future, non-immediate timeline.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. (""At least I DID try"" refers to coping, not an attempt).
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life"").
        *   Specific method: No.
        *   Preparation: The wallpaper is a mental reinforcement, not a *means* preparation.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (""When it will happen I am unsure,"" ""not live to see my 40th birthday (2023)""). This is a future, non-immediate timeline.
        *   Therefore, this path does not lead to BEHAVIOR.

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → This matches the current analysis.
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes (""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life"").
        *   Non-actionable methods: No specific method.
        *   No preparation (of means) or immediate timeline: Confirmed.

    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is clear, active, confirmed intent.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post contains a very strong, active statement of suicidal desire (""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life""). However, it explicitly states uncertainty about *when* it will happen and provides a non-immediate future timeframe (""will not live to see my 40th birthday in 2023""). There is no specific method mentioned, nor any concrete preparation of means. The ""wallpaper"" is a mental reinforcement, not a preparation of means. This combination of clear intent without a specific plan, means, or immediate timeline perfectly fits the definition of **Ideation**.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, no immediate behavior. Ideation is appropriate.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not immediate.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection; intent is confirmed.
5.  Output exactly one: Yes.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kill myself"" (repeatedly, in past and present context).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""tired of being criticized and unloved"", ""worse decision I ever made was staying here"" (indicates despair and regret for living).
    *   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness, despair, regret, self-criticism (""pussy"").
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **Past actions:** ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down."" This describes a past situation where the individual was at the point of acting on suicidal intent but stopped themselves. The regret (""I shouldn't have talked myself down"") reinforces the suicidal intent behind that past moment. This fits the definition of an ""aborted attempt"" as per the 'Attempt' category clarification.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself."" (Clear active desire). The past event also shows active intent that was self-interrupted.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No, the post expresses regret for *not* having acted on the suicidal thoughts (""I shouldn't have talked myself down""), which is the opposite of rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago..."" (Describes a past aborted attempt).
    *   **Present intent:** ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself."" (Ongoing present desire to act on past suicidal opportunities).
    *   **Future ideation:** Not explicitly future, but the ""everyday"" desire implies a continuous present/future ideation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **Start here →**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** Yes. The statement ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down"" describes a past event where the individual was on the verge of a suicide attempt but stopped themselves. This falls under the 'Attempt' category's clarification: ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped')"". The regret over not completing it (""shouldn't have talked myself down"") confirms the underlying suicidal intent for that past action.

    *   According to IRREDUCIBLE RULE 2: Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since a past aborted attempt is described, the highest applicable category is 'Attempt'.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up.

I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I just want to not exist."" This is a strong, albeit indirect, expression of a desire for non-existence, which is a common euphemism for wanting to die.
*   **Indirect death references:** ""Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?"" (desire to escape current reality). ""I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land..."" (desire for an alternate reality, not death).
*   **Emotional markers:** ""hollow,"" ""sadness,"" ""hurts so bad,"" ""I hate this,"" ""suffer,"" ""God I fucking hate myself."" These indicate hopelessness, worthlessness, and unbearable emotional pain.
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** No past suicide attempts. The phrase ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working"" is explicitly clarified as metaphorical.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The statement ""I just want to not exist"" is presented as an active, personal desire of the writer. It is not framed as an intrusive thought.
*   **Passive experience:** Not applicable for ""I just want to not exist.""
*   **Rejection noted?** No rejection or disavowal of the desire to ""not exist."" The ""metaphorically, unfortunately"" only applies to the preceding phrase about working hard.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** No past suicide attempts mentioned.
*   **Present intent:** ""I just want to not exist"" indicates a current desire.
*   **Future ideation:** No specific future plans or non-specific timing for suicidal action.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **Start here →**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
    *   No. The ""kill myself working"" was explicitly metaphorical.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → BEHAVIOR**
    *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""I just want to not exist"" signifies a desire for an end to life/existence.
    *   Specific method/preparation: No.
    *   Immediate timeline: No (""tonight,"" ""right now"").
    *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → IDEATION**
    *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, ""I just want to not exist"" fits the definition of an explicit wish to die/not exist.
    *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, there is no specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline mentioned.
    *   This perfectly matches the criteria for IDEATION.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → INDICATOR**
    *   No, because ""I just want to not exist"" is an active expression of suicidal desire, not merely distress, a metaphor, or a rejected thought.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable, as only ideation is identified.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The desire to ""not exist"" is not rejected. The ""metaphorically"" applies to a different phrase.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""I just want to end it,"" ""I just want to put a bullet right through it,"" ""I just want to die,"" ""I hate being alive."" The writer clearly owns these thoughts and desires.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The phrase ""someone please murder me becasue i dont have the balls to take my own life"" is crucial. This is *not* a rejection of the desire to die, nor a rejection of the specific method mentioned (""put a bullet right through it""). Instead, it expresses a perceived *lack of courage or capability* to perform the act *themselves*, while still strongly desiring death and even suggesting an external means to achieve it. The desire to die is active and persistent. Therefore, this does *not* trigger the ""rejection downgrade"" rule.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I just want to end it,"" ""I just want to put a bullet right through it,"" ""I just want to die."" These are current, active desires.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future timing, but the desire is immediate in its presence. No ""tonight"" or ""now"" for an immediate timeline, but the desire is very strong and current.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""I just want to end it"", ""I just want to die"", ""take my own life"").
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""put a bullet right through it"". This is a specific, actionable method.
        *   **Preparation:** No.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No explicit ""tonight"" or ""now"".

    Based on the definition of **Behavior**: ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"". ""put a bullet right through it"" clearly falls under a specific method. The presence of a specific method, combined with explicit suicidal desire, qualifies it for Behavior. The ""I don't have the balls"" indicates a perceived barrier to self-execution, but not a rejection of the desire for death or the specific method itself. The desire and the method are both present.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all references are to the writer's feelings and desires.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No explicit immediate timeline, but a specific method is present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable. The ""I don't have the balls"" is a statement of perceived inability to act, not a rejection of the desire to die. The desire to die is reinforced by ""someone please murder me"" and repeated ""I just want to die"".
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output one category.

The post contains explicit suicidal desire (""I just want to end it"", ""I just want to die"") and a specific method (""put a bullet right through it""). This combination aligns directly with the ""Behavior"" category definition.

    *   **Future ideation:** ""i could take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep"" (hypothetical, not an imminent plan, and immediately followed by rejection).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Rule: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt).
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes.
        *   Specific method: Yes (""pills"").
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No. ""while everyones asleep"" is hypothetical and not immediate, especially given the rejection.
        *   *Crucially*, the strong rejection (""too scared"", ""don't want to die"") prevents it from being Behavior. Behavior requires intent *and capability/imminence*, which is undermined by the explicit disavowal of action.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes (""wish i could just fucking end it"").
        *   Non-actionable methods: While ""pills"" can be actionable, the *rejection* of acting on it makes it non-actionable *for the writer at this moment*.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Correct.
        *   *However*, the presence of the strong rejection (Rule 4) is key. The post contains ideation, but the rejection of *acting* on it is paramount.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
        *   General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair: Yes, extensively.
        *   Metaphorical death references: ""wasn't made for life.""
        *   Rejected/intrusive thoughts: **YES.** ""i could take a bunch of pills... but honestly i'm just too scared. i don't want to die in pain. i don't want to make my mother sad."" This directly aligns with the Indicator definition's clarification: ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"". The user is expressing a desire for death but explicitly stating reasons for *not* acting on it.

**Irreducible Rules Application:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** All analysis is on the writer's statements.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt is described.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as there's no immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** **APPLIES STRONGLY.** ""but honestly i'm just too scared. i don't want to die in pain. i don't want to make my mother sad."" This explicit disavowal of action, despite the presence of suicidal desire, downgrades the classification to Indicator. The user is articulating *why they are not acting* on the suicidal thoughts.

**Conclusion:** While the post contains clear suicidal ideation, the explicit and strong rejection of *acting* on these thoughts (""too scared,"" ""don't want to die in pain,"" ""don't want to make my mother sad"") aligns directly with the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" component of the **Indicator** category and Irreducible Rule 4. The user is expressing distress and suicidal thoughts, but also actively disavowing the action.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>

    *   **Rejection noted? (writer):** Yes, for *current* state: ""Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me)."" This is a rejection of *current* ideation, but not a rejection of the *past attempt* itself.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** The post *does* contain a description of the *writer's* past suicide attempt. While much of the post is about the friend, the classification must be based on the writer's own risk as described in the post.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since a past attempt is described by the writer, this takes precedence over any other potential categories (though the writer explicitly rejects current ideation/behavior).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable to the writer's current state.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The writer *does* reject *current* suicidal ideation. However, the rule ""Rejection downgrade: 'I don't actually want to' → indicator"" applies to *current* active desire. The presence of a *past concrete action* (an attempt) is the highest category and is not downgraded by a current rejection of ideation. The post *describes* an attempt by the writer.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will ensure this.

**Conclusion:** The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt by the writer (""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded""). This falls directly under the definition of ""Attempt"".

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""kermit sewer slide"" thoughts. This is a widely understood euphemism/meme for suicide or self-harm, implying suicidal ideation.
    *   Indirect death references: None beyond the above.
    *   Emotional markers: ""scared"", ""worry"", ""tired of always being afraid and upset"", ""tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation"", ""shame"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The phrase ""And it's tempting a lot of the time"" indicates active consideration and a pull towards these suicidal thoughts, rather than just passive experience or rejection.
    *   Passive experience: ""I still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" initially sounds passive, but ""it's tempting"" overrides this, indicating active engagement with the idea.
    *   Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal. The thoughts are described as ""tempting,"" which is the opposite of rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: ""it's tempting a lot of the time"" describes a current, ongoing state of ideation.
    *   Future ideation: No specific future plans or non-specific timing mentioned beyond the ongoing temptation.

    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →

        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, the ""tempting"" nature of ""kermit sewer slide"" thoughts fits this.
        *   Non-actionable methods: ""kermit sewer slide"" is a general concept, not a specific, actionable plan.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Confirmed.
        *   This aligns with **IDEATION**.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts →
        *   No, because the thoughts are described as ""tempting,"" which goes beyond *only* distress or rejected thoughts and indicates active suicidal desire.

**Category Definition Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire (""tempting"").
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'..."" - The ""kermit sewer slide"" thoughts being ""tempting"" fits this. ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"" - ""kermit sewer slide"" is non-actionable. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" - Confirmed. This is a strong match.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.

Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls?

Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it?

        *   **Preparation:** No *actual* preparation, but consideration of logistics as a barrier.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No.
        *   *Decision:* The presence of explicit suicide intent *and* a specific method meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR according to the decision tree's logical OR. While there are stated barriers (""coward"", ""don't know how to deal with end of life stuff"") and no immediate timeline, the framework's definition of Behavior includes ""Specific method stated"" as a sufficient condition when paired with intent. The ""Ideation"" category's clarification mentions ""Non-actionable methods"" or lack of specification, which ""jump in front of a train"" is not. Therefore, the specific method pushes it out of Ideation and into Behavior, despite the stated barriers to immediate action.

    *   Emotional markers: ""confinement mental break down"", ""growing more depressed"", ""feeling more alone"".
    *   Specific methods: ""slitting my wrists"".
    *   Preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Past actions: ""i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it."" - This describes a past *thought* or *impulse*, not a physical action or attempt. The ""but I didn't do it"" explicitly negates an attempt.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""i thought about slitting my wrists today"" indicates an active, conscious thought of self-harm.
    *   Passive experience: Not presented as intrusive (""my brain tells me..."").
    *   Rejection noted?: ""but i didnt do it"" - This is a rejection of the *action*, not necessarily the underlying suicidal *desire* or *thought* itself. The ongoing ""growing more depressed"" suggests the ideation may persist.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""i thought about slitting my wrists today"" - Describes a thought that occurred today but was not acted upon.
    *   Present intent: ""i am growing more depressed and feeling more alone."" - Describes current emotional state. No explicit *current* intent or immediate plan to act.
    *   Future ideation: None explicitly stated.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?**
        *   ""i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it.""
        *   The definition of ATTEMPT includes ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent. Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped').""
        *   The key phrase ""but I didn't do it"" means no physical action was initiated or carried out. It was a thought/impulse, not an attempt. So, not ATTEMPT.

    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, the thought of ""slitting my wrists"" implies intent.
        *   Specific method: ""slitting my wrists"" - Yes.
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No. The thought was ""today,"" but the action was explicitly *not* taken, and there's no indication of *current* or *imminent* intent to act.
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   Explicit wish to die: While not using phrases like ""I want to die,"" the specific thought of ""slitting my wrists"" constitutes active suicidal desire/ideation.
        *   Non-actionable methods: ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method. However, since it was not acted upon and there's no immediate timeline, it falls under ideation rather than behavior.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Correct.
        *   The ""Rejection downgrade"" rule (""I don't actually want to"" → indicator) does not fully apply here. The post rejects the *action* (""but I didn't do it""), not necessarily the *desire* or *thought* itself, especially given the ongoing depression. The presence of a specific method in the thought elevates it beyond mere distress or fully rejected intrusive thoughts. This fits the definition of IDEATION.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
        *   The post contains more than *only* distress or metaphors. It includes a specific, active thought of a suicide method (""slitting my wrists""). While the action was rejected, the thought itself is more than a general ""rejected/intrusive thought"" as defined for INDICATOR, which typically implies an unwanted thought where the desire to act is rejected. Here, the *action* was rejected, but the underlying desire/thought is still present given the context of growing depression. So, not INDICATOR.

    Based on the systematic analysis, the post describes active suicidal ideation with a specific method, but without an immediate plan or action.

I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back.

        *   This leads to **IDEATION**.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, because there is explicit suicide desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"" - This matches perfectly. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" - This also matches.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The writer clearly states ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"" and ""I'm fucking done. [...] I end thing v v soon."" This is active, direct intent.
*   **Rejection noted?** The phrase ""only reason I didn't die last night was bc I actually wanna live if I could get the help I need right now"" is a *conditional* desire to live, immediately negated by the subsequent explanation that such help is impossible (""bc of my city and it's healthcare system and workers and how they view me... they just treat me like shit or are done with me""). This is not a disavowal of suicidal intent but a lament about why living is not possible under current circumstances, reinforcing the active intent to die.

2.  **Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation:** The explicit mention of ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" and a recent near-attempt (""only reason I didn't die last night"") immediately qualifies the post as 'Attempt', overriding the strong 'Behavior' elements (specific date, imminent timeline).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While there's an imminent timeline, the presence of *past attempts* is the highest category.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""I'm trying to die"" is a clear statement of active suicidal desire and ownership of the thought.

        *   *Conclusion for b)*: While specific methods are mentioned, the lack of preparation evidence (e.g., ""I bought the pills"") and, critically, the absence of an immediate timeline prevents this from being classified as BEHAVIOR. The writer is still in the evaluative/exploratory phase of *how* to die, rather than having a concrete, imminent plan.

This post *does* specify methods (""hanging"", ""pills""), but the actionability is being *questioned* (""idk if... would even work"", ""idk if... would work""), implying they are not yet actionable plans. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". This fits perfectly. The post describes an active desire to die and explores specific methods without an immediate plan or confirmed preparation.
        *   **Behavior**: Ruled out due to lack of immediate timeline and concrete preparation. The methods are being discussed hypothetically regarding their effectiveness, not as confirmed means for an imminent act.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**

**Review against Category Definitions and Irreducible Rules:**
*   **Indicator:** No, because there is an active expression of suicidal desire (""I want to die""). The rejection rule (""Rejection downgrade: 'I don't actually want to' → indicator"") does not apply here, as the user is rejecting the *action* due to fear, not the *desire* itself.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"". ""No preparation or immediate timeline"".
*   **Behavior:** No, because there is no specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** No, because no past concrete action is described.

The presence of ""I want to die"" combined with the explicit lack of a plan or immediate intent (""not a specific plan for killing myself"", ""probably not gonna do anything"") clearly points to Ideation.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""i wonder why i didnt take them all"" and ""why am i such a coward"" clearly show the writer's active desire to have ended their life and regret for not doing so. There is no rejection of these thoughts.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

*   **Indirect death references:** None.
*   **Emotional markers:** ""unbearably strong,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""struggle,"" ""don't know what to do"" - indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and difficulty coping.
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** ""don't want to end up in the psych ward again"" indicates a past hospitalization for mental health reasons. This is not a description of a past suicide attempt, but rather a past intervention.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** No active endorsement of suicidal thoughts or desire (e.g., ""I want to die"" is absent).
*   **Passive experience:** ""The thoughts have been so unbearably strong,"" ""my thoughts have been in a major downward spiral"" suggest thoughts are happening *to* the individual, indicating an intrusive or overwhelming nature rather than an active desire.
*   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts. The desire to avoid the psych ward is a rejection of a specific outcome, not necessarily the underlying thoughts.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""in the past few months,"" ""psych ward again"" (past hospitalization).
*   **Present intent:** Describes current struggle (""Everyday waking up... is such a struggle,"" ""don't know what to do at this rate"") but no present suicidal intent.
*   **Future ideation:** None.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The mention of ""psych ward again"" is a past hospitalization, not a described suicide attempt.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No explicit suicide intent, no method, no preparation, no immediate timeline.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). The ""thoughts"" are not specified as suicidal.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** This fits. The post primarily describes general distress, a ""downward spiral,"" and overwhelming ""thoughts"" without explicitly stating a desire for death or suicide. The ""psych ward again"" implies a history of severe mental health issues, but the current post does not cross the threshold into explicit suicidal ideation or behavior.

**Category Definition Check:**
*   **Indicator:** ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" - Yes, this is clearly present.

The post conveys significant distress and a history of mental health crisis, but it lacks the explicit suicidal desire or intent required for 'Ideation' or higher categories according to the framework. The ""thoughts"" are ambiguous, and without explicit suicidal content, it remains at the 'Indicator' level.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""I don't wanna do this anymore"" (can imply ending life), ""lost all will to live"", ""want to die"".
    *   Indirect death references: None.

    *   Past actions: None related to suicide.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""I don't wanna do this anymore"", ""I've lost all will to live"", ""want to die"" are direct expressions of the writer's own thoughts and desires.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? No. The phrase ""I know it sounds so stupid to want to die over not having a boyfriend but it's seriously affecting my mental health"" is an acknowledgment of how the *reason* might sound to others, not a rejection or disavowal of the suicidal desire itself. The desire is affirmed (""it's seriously affecting my mental health"").

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: ""I don't wanna do this anymore"", ""lost all will to live"", ""want to die"" indicate current desires/feelings.
    *   Future ideation: ""I don't think I'll ever find my soulmate"" contributes to the hopelessness but doesn't set a future timeline for suicide.

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? Yes. The post expresses a clear ""want to die"" and ""lost all will to live"" without any specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? No, there is explicit active suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""I don't want to live anymore"", ""i can't keep living"", ""when i off myself"". The writer clearly owns these thoughts and expresses a desire for death.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""I don't want to ruin my mum's mental state when i off myself"" indicates a *reason for hesitation* or a *conflict* (concern for mother vs. desire to die), but it is *not* an explicit disavowal or rejection of the suicidal desire itself (""but I won't do it"" or ""I don't actually want to""). The core desire to die is still present.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"", ""right now"").
    *   **Future ideation:** ""when i off myself"" and ""can't continue to live for decades to come"" point to a future, non-specific timing.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   Therefore, this path does *not* lead to BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → Yes. The post clearly expresses an active desire to die (""don't want to live anymore"", ""off myself"") but lacks a specific method, preparation, or an immediate timeline.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is clear active suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal desire, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
*   **Ideation:** This matches perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'don't want to live anymore', 'off myself'"". ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". The concern for the mother is a protective factor, but the underlying active desire to die remains.
*   **Behavior:** Incorrect. No specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Incorrect. No past action described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt or behavior is present.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as there is no immediacy.

    *   **Emotional markers:** ""always tired,"" ""so tired,"" ""no motivation,"" ""tired of being sick,"" ""tired of working,"" ""so lonely,"" ""jealous."" These indicate hopelessness, exhaustion, and profound despair.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""none of the pills do enough and i'm almost out of ones to try."" This refers to medication for illness, not explicitly stated as suicide methods, but the mention of ""pills"" in a context of things ""not doing enough"" could be ambiguous.

        *   Immediate timeline: ""Soon"" is not ""tonight,"" ""right now,"" or ""this weekend"" as per the definition of ""Imminent timeline"" for BEHAVIOR.
        *   Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, ""ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."" This clearly expresses a wish to end life.
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, there's no specific plan (method/preparation) and ""soon"" is not immediate enough to fall into the 'Behavior' category's ""Imminent timeline.""
        *   This aligns well with the **IDEATION** definition: ""Explicit wish to die... No preparation or immediate timeline.""
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?
        *   No, the post contains more than *only* distress or metaphors; ""ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" goes beyond general unhappiness or metaphorical death references. It's an active statement of readiness for a final action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** ""Soon"" is not immediate enough to push it to Behavior.

While the explicit *desire to die* is rejected, the *action* taken (overdose) is a form of self-harm with the intent to end suffering or punish oneself, which falls under the umbrella of suicidal intent, even if the ultimate outcome isn't death. The act of overdosing is a suicide attempt, regardless of the stated ultimate goal.

3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as it's a past action.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The rejection (""I don't want to die"") applies to the *desire* for death, but not to the *action* of overdosing. The framework's ""rejection downgrade"" is for *thoughts* that are disavowed, not for *completed actions* that are clearly self-harm with suicidal intent. An overdose is an attempt, even if the *stated* goal wasn't death.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I'm doing it"", ""ready to go"", ""ready"". These phrases, in context, clearly refer to ending one's life.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""ready to go""
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""I feel so at peace right now, knowing I'm going to."" This calm, peaceful state, especially when associated with an imminent act, is often a significant warning sign.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** ""I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend and now I think I'm ready to go."" This strongly suggests a ""farewell"" or ""tying up loose ends"" type of preparation, which is a concrete action taken in anticipation of suicide.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I'm doing it"", ""I'm ready to go"", ""I'm ready."" Yes, the writer expresses clear, active ownership of the intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No disavowal; instead, there's a sense of acceptance and peace.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""spent some good time over the weekend"" provides context but isn't a past attempt.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I feel so at peace right now, knowing I'm going to. ... now I think I'm ready to go. I'm ready."" This indicates a current state of readiness and decision.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""doing it in the near future."" This is not vague ""someday"" but a definite, albeit unspecified, future action, coupled with current readiness.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""I'm doing it"", ""ready to go"").
        *   **Specific method:** No.
        *   **Preparation:** Yes, ""spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend"" functions as preparation (a final goodbye/tying up loose ends).
        *   **Imminent timeline:** ""in the near future"" combined with ""now I think I'm ready to go"" and ""I'm ready"" indicates a strong sense of immediacy and actionable intent. The ""Critical expansion"" for BEHAVIOR states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" While ""near future"" isn't ""tonight,"" the overall tone of finality, peace, and readiness (""I'm ready *now* to go"") pushes it beyond mere ideation into the realm of actionable intent. The presence of preparation (""spent good time"") further solidifies this.

    This post fits the criteria for **Behavior** due to clear intent, evidence of preparation (farewell-like actions), and a timeline (""in the near future"" coupled with present readiness) that suggests an imminent, actionable plan. It is more than just a wish to die (Ideation) because of the active steps (preparation) and the firm declaration of ""I'm doing it.""

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No attempt, so Behavior is the highest applicable.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** The combination of ""in the near future"" and ""I'm ready now"" with preparation indicates a strong sense of immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Yes.

*   **Preparations:** None
*   **Past actions:** Describes a past event (""4 yrs ago"") when the writer ""was suicidal"" and how the school reacted.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   The post describes a past state (""i *was* suicidal"").
*   It does *not* express current suicidal intent or desire (""I *am* suicidal"" or ""I *want* to die""). The focus is on recounting a past negative experience.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** The suicidal state is explicitly stated as being ""4 yrs ago"". The post is a historical description of an event.
*   **Present intent:** None.
*   **Future ideation:** None.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No, ""was suicidal"" refers to past ideation, not an attempt.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No, the intent is historical, not current.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No, the desire is historical, not current.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post expresses distress/frustration about a past event and references a past state of being suicidal, but it does *not* express active current suicidal desire. It falls under ""Distress without actionable suicide intent"" and ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" for the *current* post.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** The ""was suicidal"" is clearly in the past, and there is no current ideation, behavior, or attempt expressed.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable as there's no current active suicidal thought to reject.

    *   **Specific methods:** None stated.
    *   **Preparations:** None stated.
    *   **Past actions:** No past suicide attempts mentioned. ""not the first time, not the last one"" refers to the sadness, not attempts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" is a direct question indicating active consideration/desire. ""Might as well just die"" is a statement of resignation and desire. These are not presented as intrusive or rejected thoughts.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""My brain is trying to give a reason to these thoughts"" refers to the sadness/void, not the suicidal thoughts themselves.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal of the suicidal thoughts. The desire for someone to care is a desire for support *while sad*, not a rejection of the suicidal ideation itself. The post ends with an active endorsement of dying.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No past attempts.
    *   **Present intent:** ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ""Might as well just die"" indicate present consideration/desire.

        *   This points to **IDEATION**.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, because there is explicit active suicidal desire. (Rule: Rejection downgrade - not applicable as thoughts are not rejected).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

    *   **IRREDUCIBLE RULES check:**
        1.  Writer-focused: Yes.

The contingency of the trigger does not negate the actionable nature of the plan itself.

**Category Definitions Check:**

The post describes a specific method (""pistol"") and detailed preparations (""Empty my bank account,"" ""leave most of my belongings,"" ""pick a direction, and start walking,"" ""find a secluded spot where no one will find my body"").

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

This is *not* a rejection of suicidal intent or a plan.

*   **Present intent:** ""I just feel so disconected"", ""I feel im on the edge"".
*   **Future ideation/plan:** ""when i do do it"", ""decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths"". This is a concrete plan for a future action, even without an immediate timeline.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
    *   No. Childhood self-harm is not explicitly described as having suicidal intent.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → BEHAVIOR**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""Ive been suicidal"", ""when i do do it"", ""dont want the existance ive got"").
    *   **Specific method/preparation:** Yes. He has ""decided the woodland where i would do it"" (specific location/method detail) and ""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers"" (preparation evidence - planning for notes and discovery).
    *   **Immediate timeline:** No.
    *   *Conclusion:* Since there is explicit intent AND specific method/preparation, this qualifies for BEHAVIOR.

*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → IDEATION**
    *   Ruled out by the presence of specific planning.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → INDICATOR**
    *   Ruled out by explicit suicide intent and detailed planning.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No attempt, so Behavior is the highest applicable.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediate timeline, but the detailed planning is sufficient for Behavior.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No clear rejection of intent, only of the *temporary feeling's intensity*.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

The presence of active suicidal desire combined with specific planning (choosing a location, planning for notes and discovery) strongly points to ""Behavior"" according to the provided framework.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore .

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
   - **Explicit suicide references:** ""I wanna off myself."", ""I don't even wanna live anymore.""
   - **Indirect death references:** None.
   - **Emotional markers:** ""I hate my life"", ""I'm so sick and tired"", ""This is complete bullshit"", ""I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and anger.
   - **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
   - **Preparations:** None mentioned.
   - **Past actions:** None mentioned.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
   - **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore"" are direct, active expressions of suicidal desire.
   - **Passive experience:** No.
   - **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** No, there is no statement that rejects or disavows these thoughts (e.g., ""but I won't do it""). The desire is stated directly.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
   - **Past focus:** The post describes past events leading to current feelings.
   - **Present intent:** The suicidal statements (""I wanna off myself"", ""I don't even wanna live anymore"") express a current desire.
   - **Future ideation:** No specific future plan or timeline is mentioned.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
   Start here →
   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. (Move to b)
   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
      - Explicit suicide intent: YES (""I wanna off myself"", ""I don't even wanna live anymore"")
      - Specific method/preparation: NO (No method, no preparation)
      - Immediate timeline: NO (No ""tonight"", ""right now"", ""this weekend"")
      Therefore, this does *not* qualify for BEHAVIOR. (Move to c)
   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
      - Explicit suicide desire: YES (""I wanna off myself"", ""I don't even wanna live anymore"")
      - Without plan/immediacy: YES (No specific plan, no immediate timeline)
      This perfectly matches the definition of **IDEATION**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
- **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of active suicidal desire.
- **Ideation:** Matches ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"" and ""No preparation or immediate timeline"".
- **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
- **Attempt:** Ruled out because there is no description of a past concrete action of self-harm with suicidal intent.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as only ideation is present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicidal"", ""tonight's the night I guess"", ""help me stay alive"".

    *   **Emotional markers:** ""desperate"", ""hopeless"", ""no one in my life cares"", ""no one to talk to"", ""no one to help me stay alive"", ""no one will miss me"".
    *   **Specific methods:** None stated.
    *   **Preparations:** None stated.
    *   **Past actions:** ""Called the hotline"" (seeking help, not an attempt).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""tonight's the night I guess"" indicates active intent, even with a slight ambivalence (""I guess""). This is a statement of personal decision for an immediate action.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal of the ""tonight's the night"" statement. While there's a desire for help (""desperate to get help""), this doesn't negate the stated immediate intent; it rather highlights the conflict. The phrase ""I guess"" shows some hesitation, but it doesn't downgrade to a full rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""Called the hotline"" (historical action).
    *   **Present intent:** ""tonight's the night I guess"" clearly points to an immediate, present timeline.
    *   **Future ideation:** Not present.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. ""Called the hotline"" is seeking help, not an attempt.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** Yes.
        *   Explicit suicide intent: ""tonight's the night I guess"" implies ending life.
        *   Immediate timeline: ""tonight"".
        *   This directly matches the criteria for **BEHAVIOR**. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" This post fits that perfectly.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No, because of the immediate timeline (""tonight"").
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because there is clear active intent with an immediate timeline.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable, as there's no attempt described.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** ""tonight"" is a strong indicator of immediacy, overriding general distress or non-specific ideation.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The ""I guess"" and ""desperate to get help"" indicate ambivalence and distress, but not an explicit rejection of the ""tonight's the night"" statement. It's still presented as a course of action for tonight.
5.  **Output exactly one:** 'behavior'.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post contains a clear statement of immediate intent (""tonight's the night I guess"") despite the lack of a specific method and the presence of conflicting feelings (desire for help). This immediate timeline and active intent are the defining factors for the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""cutting an artery"" is a direct reference to a lethal self-harm method. The context of ""lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery"" confirms suicidal intent.
    *   **Indirect death references:** N/A.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""i just don't know who else to ask"" indicates distress and isolation, seeking information for a highly sensitive topic.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""oxy"" (oxycodone) and ""cutting an artery."" These are very specific and potentially lethal methods discussed in conjunction.
    *   **Preparations:** The question ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"" is a practical inquiry about the *execution* of a specific suicide method, including pain management. This constitutes active research or planning for a specific act, which falls under preparation.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The post is an active, practical inquiry about *how* to perform a specific lethal act. It's not passive or intrusive; it's seeking information for potential execution.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal of the suicidal thoughts or plans. The apology is about the post's appropriateness for the forum, not a rejection of the underlying intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** The question is a present inquiry about a specific, detailed method. While not stating ""doing it tonight,"" the level of detail and practical nature of the question (""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot"") suggests a current, active consideration and research into *how* to execute a plan.
    *   **Future ideation:** This is more than general future ideation; it's detailed planning/research for a specific method.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, clearly implied by discussing ""cutting an artery"" and seeking ways to manage pain during it.
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""oxy"" and ""cutting an artery.""
        *   **Preparation:** Yes, actively researching pain management for a specific lethal method (""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot"") is a form of preparation/planning.

    *   This combination strongly aligns with **Behavior**. The post demonstrates not just a wish to die (Ideation), but a detailed consideration of *how* to die using specific methods, including researching practical aspects of the act. This moves beyond abstract desire into the realm of actionable planning.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Too specific and detailed for Indicator.
*   **Ideation:** Too specific in method and too much practical inquiry for Ideation. Ideation is ""explicit wish to die"" or ""non-actionable methods."" Here, the methods are highly actionable, and the inquiry is about *how* to make them ""painless,"" indicating a step towards execution.
*   **Behavior:** Fits well. ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting"" (oxy and cutting an artery). ""Preparation evidence"" (the active inquiry about combining methods for pain management is a form of planning/research for execution). While no ""imminent timeline"" is stated, the presence of specific methods and preparation evidence is sufficient for Behavior according to the framework (""Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → BEHAVIOR"").

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt mentioned.
3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy, but specificity of method and preparation evidence are strong.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** The phrases ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" are present, but *explicitly attributed to the friend's statement* about the user (""my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide""). The user is *reacting* to these statements, not making them their own.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""going to die"" is also attributed to the friend.
    *   **Emotional markers:** The user expresses significant distress: ""really played on my mind,"" ""not sitting well with me at all,"" ""hurt me,"" ""no faith in me,"" ""brutal,"" ""thoughtless and hurtful,"" ""view her differently,"" ""upset,"" ""don't know what to say."" This is clear distress.
    *   **Specific methods:** None stated by the user for themselves.

    *   **Past actions:** None by the user. The user mentions ""I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject."" This is a coping mechanism for the friend's words, not an attempt.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The user *does not* express any active desire to die or kill themselves. All references to suicide are in the context of what the *friend said* about the user.
    *   **Passive experience:** The user is experiencing distress *because of the friend's words*.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** Yes, the user explicitly states: ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness."" This is a clear rejection of suicidal intent and an affirmation of their will to live and cope. The entire post is about how to handle the *friend's* hurtful words, not about their own suicidal thoughts.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** The friend's comment was ""a couple of weeks ago.""
    *   **Present intent:** The user's present state is distress and seeking advice on how to handle the social situation with the friend. There is no present suicidal intent.
    *   **Future ideation:** No future suicidal ideation from the user.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. The user describes fighting their mental illness and changing the subject, not an attempt.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. There is no explicit suicide intent from the user.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. The user does not express a desire to die.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post is overwhelmingly about the user's distress (""hurt,"" ""upset"") caused by the friend's words. The suicide references are *not* the user's own active suicidal ideation but rather the *friend's words* which are causing the distress. The user explicitly states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" which acts as a rejection of the implied outcome (suicide). This fits the definition of ""Distress without actionable suicide intent"" and ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" (in this case, the intrusive/hurtful thoughts are from the friend).

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, I focused on the user's own feelings and intent, not the friend's. The suicide references are external to the user's own intent.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no higher categories apply to the user's own statements.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The user's statement ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"" acts as a strong rejection of suicidal intent, reinforcing the 'Indicator' classification.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post clearly expresses significant emotional distress and hurt. While it mentions suicide, these mentions are solely in the context of a friend's insensitive and hurtful comments *about* the user, not as the user's own active suicidal thoughts or desires. Crucially, the user explicitly states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" indicating a rejection of suicidal outcomes. The user is seeking advice on a relational conflict stemming from these comments, not on how to act on suicidal thoughts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator'.

    *   **Specific methods:** ""jump out"" (from a window), ""scissors"" (potential means for self-harm or to facilitate jumping by cutting the screen).
    *   **Preparations:** ""im at my window right now with scissors"" - indicates being at a specific location with a means, poised for action.
    *   **Past actions:** None described.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out."" This is an active, present, and strong urge/feeling of imminent action.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not passive.
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""i dont know what to do-"" This indicates ambivalence and distress, but it is *not* an explicit rejection or disavowal of the suicidal thought/action (e.g., ""but I don't want to do it""). It's a plea for intervention.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes.
    *   Specific method/preparation: No.
    *   Immediate timeline: No (""one day"" is not immediate; the ""only thing stopping"" indicates a deferral).
    *   Therefore, this is not a BEHAVIOR.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
    *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""im going to kill myself one day"", ""might as well die"", ""just want to run away to a forest and fucking die"").
    *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes. No specific method or preparation, and the timeline is ""one day"" (non-immediate). The ""only thing stopping"" confirms a lack of immediate action.
    *   This condition is met. The post fits **IDEATION**.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is explicit suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. Explicit wish to die (""want to kill myself"", ""fucking die""), non-actionable/non-specific methods (implied dying in a forest, but no *how*), no preparation, and no immediate timeline (""one day""). The conditional hope (""only thing stopping"") defers action but doesn't negate the active desire.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of past action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No Attempt or Behavior, Ideation is the highest applicable.
3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.
4.  Rejection downgrade: Not applicable, as the ""stopping"" factor is a conditional deferral, not a disavowal of the desire itself.
5.  Output exactly one: Will do.

74,"Hoping to be murdered. I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die. I'm so hyperaware of how I'm clearly defective and unfit to be alive. It's like I have a terminal illness no one recognizes. I just have to pray for some random person to murder me.",1,ideation,"**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kill myself"", ""end my life"", ""want to die"", ""terminally suicidal people"", ""end it all"", ""killing myself"".
*   **Indirect death references:** ""Hoping to be murdered"", ""wish that someone will just end my life for me"", ""wish so badly for me to get murdered"", ""pray for some random person to murder me"", ""stop prolonging my suffering"".
*   **Emotional markers:** ""I hate being alive"", ""losing more hope"", ""difficult to endure"", ""tearing up randomly"", ""crying myself to sleep"", ""useless I am"", ""alone I am"", ""defective and unfit to be alive"", ""terminal illness"".
*   **Specific methods:** The desired method is ""murdered"". While this is an external agent, it is a specific means by which the writer wishes to die.
*   **Preparations:** ""walk through sketchy areas every night"" is described as an ongoing action taken with the intent of facilitating the desired outcome (being murdered). This is a repeated, current action driven by the desire for death.
*   **Past actions:** None described.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The writer explicitly states ""I want to die"", ""I hate being alive"", and actively wishes for death (""Hoping to be murdered"", ""wish so badly for me to get murdered""). The desire for death is strong and owned.
*   **Rejection noted?** The writer states ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself"" and ""my cowardice with killing myself"". This is a rejection of *self-inflicted* death due to lack of courage, but *not* a rejection of the *desire to die*. The desire for death is paramount and actively endorsed. The ""rejection downgrade"" rule applies to a rejection of the *thought itself* (e.g., ""my brain tells me to but I don't want to""), which is not the case here. The writer *wants* to die, just not by their own hand.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Present intent/Ongoing action:** The desire for death is current and persistent (""every single day"", ""every night""). The action of ""walking through sketchy areas every night"" is an ongoing, immediate behavior linked to the desire for death.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""I want to die"", ""end my life"").
    *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""murdered"" is the desired specific method.
    *   **Preparation/Capability/Imminent Timeline:** Yes, the writer describes an *ongoing, repeated behavior* (""walk through sketchy areas every night"") with the *explicit intent* of achieving death (being murdered). This action is taken with an ""immediate timeline"" (""every night""). This goes beyond mere ideation by involving active, current behavior aimed at achieving death.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** ""Every night"" indicates ongoing, immediate action/desire.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The rejection is of the *means of self-harm*, not the *desire to die*. The desire to die is active and strong.

The post demonstrates active suicidal desire (""I want to die"") combined with an ongoing, repeated behavior (""walking through sketchy areas every night"") that is explicitly intended to facilitate death (""hoping to be murdered""), with an immediate and recurring timeline. This combination of intent, specific (desired) method, and ongoing action places it in the Behavior category.

    *   **Indirect death references:** ""my favorite part is I'll experience it painfully"" (implies self-inflicted pain leading to death), ""My day count for life is 8,000 days... can't take no more"" (implies ending life).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""glad I'm going to die"" (disturbing acceptance, finality), ""felt unwanted"" (worthlessness), ""can't take no more"" (unbearable pain/hopelessness), ""shithole"", ""joke"" (despair).
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer explicitly states ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"" and ""I think I'm going to leave,"" indicating clear ownership of these thoughts and intentions. ""I can't take no more"" is a declaration of current state leading to action.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No. There is no disavowal of the suicidal thoughts or intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"" reflects a current, active state of mind and intention. ""I can't take no more"" strongly implies an immediate or very near-future decision to act. ""See you all on the other side. Take care."" functions as a farewell, indicating an imminent departure/action.
    *   **Future ideation:** While ""going to die"" is future tense, the surrounding context (""glad I'm going to die,"" ""can't take no more,"" ""See you all on the other side"") transforms it from non-specific ideation into an expression of immediate intent and finality.

    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →

        *   **Specific method/preparation:** No.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes. The phrases ""I can't take no more"" and ""See you all on the other side. Take care."" strongly imply an imminent timeline and a farewell, indicating an immediate intent to act. This aligns with the ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"" under the Behavior definition. The overall tone is one of finality and impending action.

    *   Therefore, the classification is **BEHAVIOR**.

**Category Definitions with Key Clarifications Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to active suicidal desire and implied immediacy.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is a strong implication of immediacy and a farewell, pushing it beyond mere desire without a plan/immediacy. The ""Key boundary: Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"" is met by the functional equivalent of ""can't take no more"" and the farewell.
*   **Behavior:** Fits. There is clear intent (""glad I'm going to die"", ""going to leave"") and a strong implication of an ""Imminent timeline"" through phrases like ""can't take no more"" and the farewell ""See you all on the other side."" This falls under ""Expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details.""
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all statements are about the writer's intentions and feelings.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as only one category is strongly indicated.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Yes, the immediacy implied by ""can't take no more"" and the farewell ""See you all on the other side"" pushes it definitively to Behavior.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of thoughts is present.

    *   **Rejection noted?** No.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** Expresses a current desire (""I just want to""), but no immediate plan or action.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No. There is no explicit suicide intent (like ""I want to die"" or ""kill myself""), no method, no preparation, and no immediate timeline.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** This requires ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"". The post says ""want to disappear"" which is defined as a *metaphorical* death reference, not an explicit wish to die. It expresses profound distress and a desire for relief, but not active suicidal desire in the explicit sense required for Ideation.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
        *   The post clearly shows distress (""broken remainings of my soul"", ""all this pain"").
        *   ""I just want to disappear"" is explicitly listed as a ""Metaphorical death reference"" under the 'Indicator' category.
        *   There are no rejected thoughts.
        *   This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt/behavior).
*   **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable (no immediacy).
*   **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable (no rejection).
*   **Output exactly one:** Will output one.

**Final Decision:** The post expresses general unhappiness, hopelessness, and uses a metaphorical death reference (""want to disappear"") without any explicit suicidal desire, plan, or immediacy. This fits the definition of 'Indicator'.

*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kill myself"", ""suicide""
*   **Emotional markers:** The rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" indicates deep distress and a challenge to find reasons to live.
*   **Specific methods:** None explicitly stated.
*   **Preparations:** The statement ""I just need a plan for suicide"" explicitly indicates an active search for or a requirement for a method/plan, which is a form of preparation or a step towards capability.
*   **Past actions:** None.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The phrases ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" and ""I just need a plan for suicide"" clearly demonstrate active, personal endorsement of suicidal thoughts and a stated need to move towards action.
*   **Rejection noted?** No rejection or disavowal of these thoughts.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Present intent:** The post expresses a current state of mind and a present need (""I just need a plan""). While the action itself is pending the plan, the *need* for the plan is immediate.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → Yes.
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" clearly convey this.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I just need a plan for suicide"" signifies a crucial step towards capability. It's not merely wishing to die (Ideation); it's actively seeking the means/method, which constitutes a form of preparation or moving towards an actionable plan. This goes beyond passive ideation by indicating a current, active requirement to proceed.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES applied:**
*   Writer-focused: Yes, all statements are about the writer.
*   Temporal hierarchy: N/A, no attempt described.
*   Immediacy trumps: While not a specific ""tonight"" timeline, the ""need a plan"" indicates an urgent, current missing piece for action, suggesting high intent and active movement towards capability.
*   Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.

The statement ""I just need a plan for suicide"" elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior. It indicates that the individual has the intent and is actively seeking the final component (the plan/method) to move towards action, thus demonstrating a step towards capability.

    *   Emotional markers: ""almost uncontrollably saying"", ""am I crazy or can anyone else relate?"" (seeking validation, distress).
    *   Specific methods: ""finger gun in my mouth"" (simulated). ""Stayed in the car"" implies a vehicle-related method for the past attempt.
    *   Preparations: None for *current* intent.
    *   Past actions: ""my most recent failed attempt"". This is a direct statement of a past concrete action. ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" is mentioned as something they *say*, not necessarily a present plan, but indicates a history of self-harm thoughts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   ""I'm going to kill myself"": Described as ""almost uncontrollably saying,"" ""almost like Tourettes."" This suggests an intrusive thought/utterance rather than active, endorsed intent *in the present moment*. This leans towards ""rejected/intrusive thoughts"" as per the Indicator definition.
    *   ""I wish I stayed in the car"": This is a regret related to a *past failed attempt*, implying past intent.
    *   ""pretending to blow my brains out"": This is a *simulated* action, not an actual intent to act.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""my most recent failed attempt"" (clear past action). ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (past regret).
    *   Present intent: The ""uncontrollably saying"" and ""putting a finger gun"" describe *current patterns*, but the intent behind these is described as intrusive/simulated, not active, endorsed intent to act *now*.

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
        *   Yes, the post explicitly states: ""my most recent failed attempt"".
    *   This rule takes precedence. Even though the *current* ""I'm going to kill myself"" utterances are described as intrusive/uncontrolled (which might otherwise lead to Indicator), the explicit mention of a past ""failed attempt"" is a definitive criterion for the ""Attempt"" category.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I want to kill myself"", ""I still have the urge to just blow my brains out"" - Yes, the desire is actively stated.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""thoughts of how it would feel to die rushing through my head"" - Describes the experience of the thoughts.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** This is critical. The post contains strong counter-statements: ""but I'm scared"", ""I don't want to leave my cats. I don't want to leave my friends. I don't want to."", ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already."", ""I can never bring myself to actually do it."" These are explicit rejections/inhibitions of *acting* on the suicidal desire.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""I can never bring myself to actually do it"" describes a continuous state of not acting.
    *   **Present intent:** ""every single day I still have the urge"", ""I lay in bed at night, thoughts... rushing through my head"" - Describes ongoing ideation/urges. No immediate timeline for *action* is stated.
    *   **Future ideation:** None.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The post explicitly states ""I can never bring myself to actually do it.""
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit intent:** Yes (""I want to kill myself"").
        *   **Specific method:** Yes (""blow my brains out"", ""pull the trigger"").
        *   **Preparation/Immediacy:** No.

    At this point, the presence of explicit intent and a specific method might suggest 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'. However, the **Irreducible Rules** and **Category Definitions** must be applied, especially concerning rejection.

    *   **Irreducible Rule 4: Rejection downgrade: 'I don't actually want to' → indicator.**
        The post contains multiple phrases that directly trigger this rule: ""I don't want to leave my cats. I don't want to leave my friends. I don't want to."" It also states ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"" and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it,"" which are strong statements of *inability or unwillingness to act*.
        While the initial desire (""I want to kill myself"") is present, the overwhelming context is a strong internal conflict where the *action* is explicitly rejected or inhibited by fear, attachment, and perceived inability. This fits the spirit of ""rejected thoughts"" where the desire is present but the *will to act* is disavowed.

    *   **Indicator Definition:** ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"" - Although the phrasing isn't ""my brain tells me,"" the core message is ""I have this desire, but I will not/cannot act on it, and I don't want the consequences."" This is a clear rejection of the *action*.

    Therefore, despite the presence of explicit desire and method, the strong and repeated rejection of *acting* on these thoughts, as per Irreducible Rule 4, downgrades the classification.

I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job.

    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. There is no explicit intent to *act*, and the post explicitly disavows deliberate action.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → While there are expressions that *lean* towards a desire for an end to suffering/existence, the explicit rejection ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" prevents it from being classified as active 'Ideation'. According to the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule, this disavowal is key.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This fits. The post is overwhelmingly about distress and hopelessness. The ""better if I didn't have to try anymore"" can be seen as a metaphorical expression of wanting an end to suffering. Crucially, the thought of death/not existing is immediately followed by a clear rejection of *deliberate action*. This aligns perfectly with the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" and ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" criteria for 'Indicator', bolstered by the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt/behavior).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" directly triggers this rule, pushing the classification towards 'Indicator'.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a passive contemplation of death or an end to suffering. However, the explicit statement ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" acts as a strong rejection of active suicidal intent. This, combined with the lack of specific plans, methods, or immediate timeline, places the post in the 'Indicator' category.

*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"", ""thought about suicide""
*   **Indirect death references:** ""i just want to collapse and let go"" (in context, this implies a desire for cessation from pain/life)
*   **Emotional markers:** ""disappointed"", ""crushed and empty"", ""too hard"", ""can't keep getting false hope"", ""pain""
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** None.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" indicates the writer is actively experiencing and acknowledging these thoughts as part of their current state. ""i just want to collapse and let go"" expresses a desire for an end, linked to the increasing suicidal thoughts.
*   **Passive experience:** Not framed as purely intrusive or external (""my brain tells me..."").
*   **Rejection noted?** The post mentions a *past* thought of powering through (""a couple days i thought that maybe i can power through""), but immediately counters this with ""now it's like i'm back to square one. this is too hard... my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"". This indicates the *current* state is one where the thoughts are strengthening and the previous resistance is failing, rather than an active rejection of the thoughts themselves. The ""help me please"" is a plea for assistance with the overwhelming feelings and strengthening thoughts, not a disavowal of the suicidal desire.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""past me would've been so disappointed"", ""a couple days i thought that maybe i can power through"" (describing a past state/hope).
*   **Present intent:** ""today is the anniversary..."", ""now it's like i'm back to square one. this is too hard..."", ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"", ""i just want to collapse and let go"". The strengthening of thoughts and the desire to ""let go"" are presented as current and escalating.
*   **Future ideation:** Implied by the strengthening thoughts, but no specific future plan.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Rule: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation)
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" clearly indicates active suicidal ideation/desire. ""i just want to collapse and let go"" further supports this.
    *   **Specific method/preparation:** No.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** No explicit ""tonight"", ""right now"", ""this weekend"". ""Stronger and stronger"" indicates escalation but not immediate action.
    *   *Result for b):* Does not meet criteria for BEHAVIOR due to lack of method, preparation, or immediacy.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
    *   **Explicit wish to die:** Yes, ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" directly indicates active suicidal desire. ""i just want to collapse and let go"" is a desire for cessation.
    *   **Non-actionable methods:** ""collapse and let go"" is a desire for cessation, but not a specific actionable method.
    *   **No preparation or immediate timeline:** Confirmed.
    *   *Result for c):* This fits the definition of IDEATION.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because there is explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" that are ""getting stronger and stronger,"" which goes beyond mere distress or rejected thoughts. The intent analysis confirms these are active and escalating, not rejected. (Rule: Rejection downgrade is not applicable here as thoughts are strengthening, not being disavowed).

**Final Classification Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because the post explicitly states ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger,"" which is more than just distress or rejected thoughts.
*   **Ideation:** Fits. There is explicit suicidal desire (""suicidal thoughts get stronger"") without a specific plan, method, or immediate timeline.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

The presence of ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" is the primary driver for classifying this as Ideation, as it signifies active and escalating suicidal desire.

    *   **Preparations:** ""I am planning to kill myself"" (indicates planning, though no specific physical preparation like acquiring means is mentioned).
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I am planning to kill myself"" - This is a clear statement of active intent and ownership of the thought.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No rejection. The phrases ""I don't wish them any grief or guilt. This is my problem, my illness, it's on me. I expect nothing from no one."" reinforce the decision and resolve, rather than disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.

        *   **Behavior:** This fits perfectly. It contains ""Explicit suicide intent"" (""I am planning to kill myself"") and an ""Imminent timeline"" (""tonight""). The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior explicitly states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"".
        *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""hanging myself"", ""finally do it"", ""deserves to die"", ""thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy"", ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""be over soon"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""life is fucked"", ""no turning it around"", ""worthless trash"", ""pain"".
    *   **Specific methods:** ""hanging myself"".
    *   **Preparations:** ""I've been practicing hanging myself"", ""keep practicing"", ""train myself to break this natural survival instinct"". This is strong evidence of specific, repeated preparatory actions.
    *   **Past actions:** ""I've been practicing"" (describes ongoing past behavior that is preparatory in nature, not a past attempt).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it"", ""I'm just worthless trash who deserves to die"", ""No one is going to convince me otherwise"", ""I'm going to keep practicing... and I will succeed"", ""The thought makes me so happy"", ""I take great solace knowing that this pain... will be over soon"", ""I don't want anyone to take this away from me"".

*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal. The reason ""so i can't hurt anyone"" is a motivation for the desire, not a rejection of the desire itself.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""I want to die."", ""take myself away from here"").
    *   **Specific method/preparation:** No.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes, ""if not tonight"". This phrase directly references an imminent timeframe (""tonight"") for the suicidal action. This aligns with the ""Behavior"" category's ""Imminent timeline"" criterion and its ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" The statement ""I am on the edge"" further reinforces the immediacy and high risk.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit active suicidal desire and consideration of immediate timeline.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the ""Key boundary"" states it becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with ""tonight"" or ""now"". The post explicitly uses ""tonight"".
*   **Behavior:** Fits the criteria. There is explicit suicide intent (""I want to die"", ""take myself away from here"") combined with an imminent timeline (""if not tonight""). While no method is specified, the immediate intent is clear.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempt is described.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Yes, the ""if not tonight"" overrides the general ""one day"" and the base ideation, elevating it to Behavior.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal thoughts.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'behavior'.

**Conclusion:** The presence of explicit suicidal desire (""I want to die"", ""take myself away from here"") combined with the consideration of an immediate timeline (""if not tonight"") and the feeling of being ""on the edge"" clearly places this post in the Behavior category.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** No active endorsement of suicidal thoughts/actions.
*   **Passive experience:** ""I just don't want to exist"" is a passive expression of desire for non-existence, not active self-harm.
*   **Rejection noted?** YES. ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish."" This is a clear and explicit disavowal of suicidal intent.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** Describes past events (lockdown, studying, anxiety attacks) that led to current feelings.
*   **Present intent:** ""I just don't want to exist"" is a present feeling, but not an *intent* to act.
*   **Future ideation:** ""I don't know what will i do after college"" is future uncertainty, not suicidal ideation.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE & IRREDUCIBLE RULES:**

*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No. There is no explicit suicide intent; in fact, there's explicit rejection.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No. The post explicitly states ""Im not suicidal or something."" and ""I think that suicide is selfish,"" which directly contradicts ""explicit suicide desire.""
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes.

**Irreducible Rules Application:**
*   **Writer-focused:** All analysis is on the writer's statements.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no higher categories are met.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** This rule is crucial here. The explicit statement ""Im not suicidal or something"" and ""I think that suicide is selfish"" clearly indicates a rejection of suicidal intent, pushing it towards 'indicator' even if ""don't want to exist"" might initially sound like ideation. The definition of 'Indicator' specifically includes ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"" and ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire."" This post fits perfectly.
*   **Output exactly one:** One category will be chosen.

Based on the strong explicit rejection of suicidal intent and the presence of general distress and metaphorical death references, the post aligns with the 'Indicator' category.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

    *   **Passive experience:** Not the primary focus.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No rejection of their *own* suicidal thoughts or desire. The rejection is towards *others'* reasons for wanting them to live (""Why does everyone want me to live?""). The writer is questioning the societal response and others' interference, not disavowing their own intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""I attempted suicide last week"", ""my attempt had failed"", ""For the past few days after my attempt"". This is a clear description of a past event.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I want to take my life"" (general desire), ""I am yet again back to square one"" (return to a state of hopelessness). No immediate plan for *now* is stated.
    *   **Future ideation:** Not explicitly stated as future-only.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → **YES**. The post explicitly states: ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note... (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed"".
    *   This immediately leads to the **ATTEMPT** category.

**Category Definitions Check:**

*   **Attempt** (Past concrete action)
    *   ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" - Yes, ""I attempted suicide last week"".
    *   ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"" - Yes, ""my attempt had failed"".
    *   ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned"" - Yes, the presence of a past attempt takes precedence over any concurrent ideation or behavior.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**

1.  **Writer-focused:** All relevant statements (""I attempted suicide"", ""I want to take my life"") are about the writer.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. The explicit mention of an ""attempt"" places it in the highest risk category.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While there's present ideation, the concrete past action of an attempt is the defining factor and highest risk.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of the writer's *own* suicidal desire. The questioning is directed at external forces/opinions.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'attempt'.

The presence of a clear, explicit description of a past suicide attempt is the determining factor, overriding other elements like present ideation or distress.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""kill you"" (in the context of self-harm).
    *   Indirect death references: ""end this nightmare"" (implies ending life/suffering).
    *   Emotional markers: ""afraid"" (fear of failure, fear of continued suffering), ""nightmare"" (unbearable pain/suffering).
    *   Specific methods: ""valium"" (a specific substance/pill).
    *   Preparations: The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" strongly implies that valium *has already been taken* with suicidal intent. This is evidence of a completed or ongoing action.
    *   Past actions: ""I haven't taken enough"" directly describes a past action of taking valium, which the user perceives as insufficient to achieve their suicidal goal. This is a clear indicator of a past attempt.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I just want this nightmare to end"" clearly indicates an active desire for death/cessation of suffering. The question about valium dosage, coupled with having already taken some, confirms active intent to die by suicide.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""I haven't taken enough"" refers to a past action.
    *   Present intent: The question ""How much valium does it take..."" indicates a current need for information, possibly to complete or repeat the action.
    *   Future ideation: Not primary.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → Yes. The statement ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" explicitly describes a past action of taking valium with suicidal intent, which the user fears was insufficient. This directly fits the definition of an ""Attempt"" (""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent; Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"").

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** No, there's clear active suicidal intent and action.
*   **Ideation:** No, an action has already occurred.
*   **Behavior:** While there's intent and a specific method, the critical element is that the action has *already been initiated* (""haven't taken enough""), moving it beyond just a plan or imminent intent.
*   **Attempt:** This is the best fit. The user describes having taken a substance with suicidal intent, and is concerned it was not effective enough. This is a description of an actual self-harm action with suicidal intent, even if perceived as ""failed"" by the user.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes (""I"").
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since an attempt is described, it takes precedence.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not directly applicable as an attempt is already described.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

    *   **Past actions:** ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This is a clear description of a past, concrete action taken with suicidal intent that was interrupted/aborted.

    *   **Active endorsement:** ""Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself."", ""I'm ready to be done."", ""I'm so close to just doing it."", ""I just need someone to push me one more inch."" The writer actively endorses suicidal thoughts and desires.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The *action* was stopped (""Right before I passed out, I stopped""), but the *desire/intent* remains strong (""I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch.""). This is an *interrupted attempt*, not a rejection of the underlying suicidal desire. Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade) does not apply here because the desire is still explicitly present and strong.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** The most critical element is the description of the action: ""I put a belt around my neck... tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped..."" This is a clear past event.

*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** None.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** No. The phrase ""too scared to kill myself"" explicitly states a lack of active intent to perform the action, despite the presence of the thought.
*   **Passive experience:** The thought of suicide is present (""kill myself""), but it is immediately followed by a barrier/rejection (""too scared"").
*   **Rejection noted?** Yes, ""too scared to kill myself"" is a clear disavowal/rejection of acting on the suicidal thought. The mention of suicide being illegal and the fear of consequences (""might get arrested or fined"") further reinforces the rejection of the action.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** No.
*   **Present intent:** No, explicitly rejected.
*   **Future ideation:** No.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **Start here →**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No. While ""kill myself"" is used, the critical qualifier ""too scared to"" negates the *intent to act*. There is no method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No. The desire is immediately counteracted by the stated fear, which functions as a rejection of the action. This moves it out of active desire for *action*.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post expresses ""too tired of life"" (distress) and explicitly states ""too scared to kill myself,"" which is a clear example of a rejected/disavowed thought, fitting the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" criteria for Indicator.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** This rule is key here. ""too scared to kill myself"" directly falls under ""I don't actually want to"" (or ""I won't do it""), leading to an **Indicator** classification.

**Category Definition Check:**
The post aligns with the **Indicator** definition:
*   ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" (""too tired of life"").
*   ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"" - ""too scared to kill myself"" fits this pattern perfectly.
*   ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" - The ""too scared"" negates active desire to *act*.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""end this bullshit for good"" (strong implication of ending life), ""This will be my second to last post"" (implies finality before an action).

    *   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness, despair, anger, feeling trapped.
    *   **Specific methods:** Not explicitly named (e.g., pills, gun), but ""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"" implies a planned action/location, which serves as a proxy for a specific method or preparation.
    *   **Preparations:** ""This will be my second to last post"" is a clear statement of preparation for a final act. ""Taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"" is a concrete plan/preparation.
    *   **Past actions:** None described.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"").
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** Yes. While a specific *type* of method isn't named (e.g., jumping, pills), the phrase ""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"" describes a concrete *plan* or *preparation* for the act. The statement ""This will be my second to last post"" further reinforces preparation and finality.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No (""in April"" is not immediate).
        *   *Conclusion for b):* The presence of explicit intent combined with clear preparation/planning (the ""trip"" as the means, and the ""second to last post"" as a final action before the event) qualifies this for **Behavior**, even without an immediate timeline, because the ""preparation"" clause is met.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""to end this bullshit for good""). Crucially, it describes concrete *preparation* and a *plan* for this act (""This will be my second to last post,"" ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good""). While the timeline is not immediate (""in April""), the presence of a specific plan/preparation pushes it beyond mere ideation into the **Behavior** category, as per the definition: ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note"" (analogous to ""taking a trip"" and ""second to last post"" as preparatory actions).

    *   Passive experience: Not passive.
    *   Rejection noted?: No explicit disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No past suicidal actions.
    *   Present intent: The wish is present (""I just wish"").
    *   Future ideation: The timing is non-specific; it's a current desire rather than an immediate plan.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. (Rules out ATTEMPT)
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide *intent*: The phrasing ""wish I could"" indicates a *desire* rather than concrete *intent* to act.
        *   Specific method: Yes, ""od on meds"" is a specific method.
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (""tonight"", ""right now"").
        *   Since it's a ""wish"" and not an expression of immediate intent or a concrete plan, it doesn't meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR here. A ""wish"" is a desire, not an intent to act.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → IDEATION
        *   ""Explicit wish to die"": Yes, ""I just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds"" is an explicit wish for death by specific means.
        *   ""Non-actionable methods"": While ""od on meds"" is specific, the *wish* makes it non-actionable in the present. It's a desire, not a plan.
        *   ""No preparation or immediate timeline"": This is true.
        *   This aligns perfectly with IDEATION. The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation states it ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"", which is not present here.

*   **IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
    1.  Writer-focused: Yes, all analysis is on the writer's statements.
    2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as only one category is identified.
    3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.
    4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.
    5.  Output exactly one: Will do.

The presence of specific methods (""od on meds"") might initially lean towards Behavior, but the crucial qualifier ""I just wish I could"" frames it as a desire (Ideation) rather than an actionable intent or plan (Behavior). The lack of immediacy or preparation further solidifies it as Ideation.

They wish they were different (""I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way""). However, there is *no* statement indicating a desire to die, to end their life, or to not exist. The focus is on the suffering *within* life, not a desire for life to cease.

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? → No. There is no explicit wish to die (""want to die,"" ""don't deserve to live""). The post describes intense suffering and a wish for a different life, but not a wish for death.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? → Yes. The post clearly expresses ""general unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" (""daily torture of living life,"" ""Being unwanted""). There are no expressions of active suicidal desire. The ""torture"" is a description of their current painful existence, not a direct or indirect death reference in the context of suicide.

**Category Definition Check:**
*   **Indicator:** ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" - This aligns perfectly. ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" - This is also true. The post is about the pain of living as they are, not a desire to stop living.

*   Active endorsement: The past actions (""I've tried to kill myself"") clearly indicate active intent at those times. The current post expresses frustration, but the core suicidal content refers to past active intent.
*   Passive experience: Not applicable.
*   Rejection noted?: No rejection of the past suicidal intent. The current sentiment is about the invalidation of that past experience.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   Past focus: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" This is a clear description of historical actions.
*   Present intent: The post expresses current frustration and weariness, but no explicit present intent to act suicidally.
*   Future ideation: None mentioned.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → Yes, ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times.""

103,bruh. they always say if something/someone makes you sad then you're better off without them right? but when i say i'm better off dead everyone's like no don't do that :D,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""i'm better off dead"" (direct expression of desire for death by suicide). ""don't do that"" (refers to the implied act of suicide).
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""sad"" (contextual, not the core emotion of the post). The tone is somewhat sarcastic/frustrated, highlighting a perceived hypocrisy.
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""i'm better off dead"" is an active statement of belief/desire by the writer. The writer is claiming ownership of this thought.
    *   Passive experience: Not presented as intrusive.
    *   Rejection noted? The post states ""everyone's like no don't do that,"" which indicates *others'* rejection of the idea, not the writer's own rejection. The "":D"" emoticon after this phrase suggests sarcasm or a defiant attitude towards others' advice, reinforcing that the writer is *not* disavowing their own thought.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: No immediate timeline (""tonight"", ""right now"").
    *   Future ideation: ""i'm better off dead"" is a general statement of desire, without a specific plan or timeline.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""i'm better off dead"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   Therefore, not **Behavior**.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""i'm better off dead"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
        *   This fits the definition of **Ideation**.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, because there is an explicit expression of active suicidal desire (""i'm better off dead"") which is not rejected by the writer.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, the post is about the writer's own thoughts.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no higher categories (Attempt/Behavior) are met.
3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The writer does *not* reject their own thought ""i'm better off dead."" They are highlighting others' rejection of it, with a sarcastic tone. Thus, no downgrade to Indicator.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output 'ideation'.

**Conclusion:** The post contains an explicit wish to die (""i'm better off dead"") without any specific plan, method, or immediate timeline, and the thought is not disavowed by the writer. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""overdose help please"", ""i don't think i want to die"" (explicitly mentions death/dying, followed by a rejection of current desire). ""i did this to myself after all"" (implies self-harm/suicidal action).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""could i survive an od like this""
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""sorry"", ""inappropriate post"", ""don't know where else to post/ask"", ""my stomach is hurting very badly"", ""sweating badly and shaking too"", ""i feel like a burden"". These indicate distress, physical pain, and self-blame.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""took 44 paracetamol"" (specific drug and quantity).
    *   **Preparations:** The act of *taking* the pills is a completed action that constitutes an overdose.
    *   **Past actions:** ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" - This is a clear description of a completed action in the past. ""i did this to myself"" reinforces this.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   The phrase ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" describes an active action taken by the writer.
    *   ""i don't think i want to die but something is stopping me cllng 999."" This is complex. The *action* (taking the pills) was clearly initiated with suicidal intent (""i did this to myself after all""). The *current* statement ""i don't think i want to die"" is a *rejection* of the *current* desire to die, but it does *not* negate the *past intent* that led to the action already taken. The ""something is stopping me calling 999"" suggests ambivalence or a struggle to seek help *after* the action.
    *   The core information is the *completed action* of taking the overdose. The current ambivalence about dying does not change the fact that an overdose *was attempted*.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" and ""i did this to myself"" definitively describe a past, completed action.
    *   **Present intent:** ""i don't think i want to die but something is stopping me cllng 999"" describes current ambivalence and a struggle to seek help *after* the action.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → Yes. The post explicitly states ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" and asks for ""overdose help"". This is a direct description of a past concrete action of self-harm (overdose) with clear suicidal intent at the time of the action (""i did this to myself after all"").
        *   **Attempt definition:** ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent. Includes interrupted/aborted attempts."" This fits perfectly.
        *   **Irreducible Rule 2: Temporal hierarchy:** ""Attempt > Behavior > Ideation"". The presence of a described past attempt takes precedence over any current ideation or behavior.
        *   **Irreducible Rule 4: Rejection downgrade:** ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator. This rule applies to *thoughts/ideation* that are rejected. Here, a *past action* has already occurred. The current rejection of the *desire to die* does not downgrade a *completed attempt*. The user is seeking help *for* the overdose they already took, not just expressing distress or rejected thoughts.

**Conclusion:** The primary information in the post is the description of a past suicide attempt (overdose). The current ambivalence about dying does not change the classification of the *past action*.

    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? The phrase ""but I have no idea how, when or anything else"" clarifies a *lack of plan/immediacy*, but it does *not* reject the underlying desire to ""end it."" It's not ""I want to end it but I don't actually want to.""

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** No, because there is an explicit expression of active suicidal desire (""I want to end it""), not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
*   **Ideation:** Yes. It expresses an ""Explicit wish to die"" (""I want to end it"") with ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" (""no idea how, when or anything else"").
*   **Behavior:** No, because it lacks a specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** No, as there is no description of a past concrete action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as only ideation is present.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as there is no immediacy.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The ""but"" clause is a statement of lack of plan/means, not a rejection of the desire itself. So, no downgrade.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output 'ideation'.

The post expresses a clear suicidal desire but explicitly states a lack of plan, method, or timeline, which aligns directly with the definition of Ideation.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

    *   **Passive experience:** ""my jackass of a brain doesn't want to allow it"" describes an internal struggle where their own mind is preventing them from enjoying life. This is not an explicit suicidal thought, but an internal barrier to well-being.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit suicidal thoughts are presented to be rejected. The internal struggle described (""my jackass of a brain doesn't want to allow it"") is about enjoying life, not about suicidal ideation.

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No explicit suicide desire. The post conveys profound distress and hopelessness, but not a direct wish to die.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post is overwhelmingly focused on general unhappiness, hopelessness, despair, and an inability to cope with life's difficulties. There are no expressions of active suicidal desire. The phrase ""my jackass of a brain doesn't want to allow it"" indicates an internal struggle, fitting the spirit of rejected/intrusive thoughts or internal conflict, even if not directly about suicide.

    *   Metaphorical death references: None explicit, but ""feel like a robot,"" ""feel nothing"" indicates severe emotional numbness and distress.
    *   Rejected/intrusive thoughts: ""my jackass of a brain doesn't want to allow it"" fits the pattern of an internal struggle or thought that the user is battling, even if not directly about suicide.
    *   NO expressions of active suicidal desire: **YES**. The post does not contain phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I'm going to kill myself.""

**Irreducible Rules Check:**

The ""nothing lower but death"" comment is a general observation about the lowest point, immediately followed by messages of hope and positivity, effectively rejecting any personal suicidal interpretation. This aligns with ""Distress without actionable suicide intent"" and ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire.""

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I'd kill myself"" indicates active suicidal desire, even if conditional on having a gun. The statement ""I know how this goes for me"" suggests a recurring pattern of these thoughts.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not presented as intrusive.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal of the suicidal desire. The condition ""If I had a gun"" is about means, not a rejection of the desire itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Relapse occurred ""Last night/this morning"". No past suicide attempt.
    *   **Present intent:** The desire ""I'd kill myself"" is expressed in the present context of feeling ""like shit"" and anticipating worse feelings. While the *action* is conditional on having a gun, the *desire* is present.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""as I will in the future"" refers to anticipated worsening feelings, not future suicide timing.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""I'd kill myself"".
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""a gun"" is a specific method.
        *   **Preparation:** No.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No explicit ""tonight"" or ""right now"" for the *action*.

    According to the framework, the presence of ""Explicit suicide intent"" AND a ""specific method"" (even if conditional on possession of means) qualifies for **Behavior**. The definition of Behavior includes ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location."" ""A gun"" fits ""specific method stated."" While the lack of immediate means or timeline reduces the *immediacy* of the risk, the *classification* falls under Behavior due to the specificity of the method combined with clear intent.

    *   It's not **Indicator** because there is active suicidal desire (""I'd kill myself"").
    *   It's not **Ideation** because a *specific method* (""a gun"") is stated, moving beyond general desire or non-actionable methods.
    *   It's not **Attempt** as no past action is described.

    The crucial point is that ""Specific method stated"" is one of the criteria for Behavior, distinct from ""Imminent timeline"" or ""Preparation evidence"". This post meets the ""Specific method stated"" criterion.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** No.
*   **Present intent:** ""i just wanna kill myself"" indicates a current desire.
*   **Future ideation:** The phrase ""before i have to see him or myself get it"" links the desire to a future, conditional event (getting lung cancer). This is not an immediate timeline (""tonight"", ""right now"") but a future-oriented condition for the desire.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.

    *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""i just wanna kill myself"").
    *   Specific method: No.
    *   Preparation: No.
    *   Immediate timeline: No. The ""before"" clause is a conditional future, not an imminent ""tonight"" or ""right now"".
    *   *Conclusion:* Does not meet criteria for BEHAVIOR.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
    *   Explicit wish to die: Yes (""i just wanna kill myself"").
    *   Non-actionable methods: No specific method stated.
    *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes, the desire is present but linked to a future, conditional event, not an immediate plan.
    *   *Conclusion:* This fits the definition of IDEATION.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is explicit suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"" - Yes, ""i just wanna kill myself"". ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" - Yes, the timeline is conditional future, not immediate.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of past action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""suicide plan"", ""kill myself"", ""worthless existence"", ""move on"" (in context of ending life).
    *   Indirect death references: ""My last time posting on this account"", ""Goodbye reddit"".
    *   Emotional markers: ""worthless existence"".
    *   Specific methods: Not explicitly stated, but ""I've got a suicide plan"" and ""plan on how i can kill myself"" strongly imply a specific method exists and has been thought through (""pretty sure this will work"").
    *   Preparations: ""I've got a suicide plan"", ""after thinking it over i'm pretty sure this will work"". This indicates planning and preparation.
    *   Past actions: None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""I've got a suicide plan"", ""I plan on doing it next week"", ""I'm excited to finally move on"". The writer claims full ownership and expresses positive anticipation.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No, the writer expresses hope they ""don't get cold feet.""

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: ""I've got a suicide plan.""
    *   Future ideation: ""I plan on doing it next week."" This is a specific, imminent timeline.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide plan"").
        *   Specific method: The post states ""I've got a suicide plan"" and ""plan on how i can kill myself,"" implying a specific method is known to the writer, even if not detailed to us. The phrase ""pretty sure this will work"" reinforces this.
        *   Preparation: ""I've got a suicide plan"" and ""after thinking it over i'm pretty sure this will work"" are clear indicators of preparation.
        *   Immediate timeline: ""next week"" is a specific and imminent timeline.

    *   This post meets the criteria for **Behavior**: it expresses explicit suicide intent, provides evidence of a specific plan/preparation, and states an imminent timeline (""next week""). The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior notes that ""Expressions of immediate intent... qualify even without method details"" which applies here given the clear statement of having a plan and a timeline.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, all statements are about the user's own plans.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so Behavior is the highest applicable category.
3.  Immediacy trumps: ""next week"" is immediate enough to qualify for Behavior.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicidal thoughts"" (present recurrence), ""attempted suicide in the past"".

*   **Emotional markers:** ""Feeling bad,"" ""long history of depression,"" ""pushed me back down,"" ""massive amounts of pain,"" ""feel terrible,"" ""feel like a piece of crap,"" ""emotional cheating."" (Indicates distress, pain, worthlessness).
*   **Specific methods:** None mentioned for current thoughts.
*   **Preparations:** None mentioned for current thoughts.
*   **Past actions:** ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This is a direct statement of a past suicide attempt.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""I've begun having those thoughts again."" (Indicates current ideation).
*   **Passive experience:** Not explicitly stated as intrusive.
*   **Rejection noted?:** The writer is actively seeking help (""told my wife that I need help,"" ""set up appointments,"" ""I am going to try [to follow through]""). This is an action *against* the thoughts, not a rejection of the thoughts themselves. The post is about the difficulty of seeking help for these thoughts and pain.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" ""long history of depression and suicidal thoughts.""
*   **Present intent:** ""I've begun having those thoughts again."" (Current ideation). ""I am going to try [to follow through with appointments]."" (Current action towards help).

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **Start here →**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly states: ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago).""

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all analysis is based on the writer's statements.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. The explicit mention of a past attempt (""I have attempted suicide in the past"") immediately classifies the post as 'Attempt', overriding the concurrent 'Ideation' (""I've begun having those thoughts again"").
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as there is no immediate plan for current suicidal thoughts.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** While the writer is seeking help, they are not explicitly rejecting the current suicidal thoughts, but rather seeking treatment for them. However, the 'Attempt' classification takes precedence due to the hierarchy.
5.  **Output exactly one:** The classification will be 'attempt'.

**Category Definitions Review:**
*   The post contains ""Ideation"" (""I've begun having those thoughts again"").
*   However, the most definitive and highest-priority classification according to the rules is ""Attempt"" due to the clear statement: ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" The clarification for 'Attempt' states: ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned.""

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None.
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""can't socialize well,"" ""suffering,"" ""afraid he won't want baggage like me,"" ""go insane"" (hypothetical outcome), ""so many issues,"" ""never felt like that's been an option,"" ""depression,"" ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm), ""can't even cope,"" ""getting to be too much."" -> High levels of distress, hopelessness, isolation, feeling overwhelmed, and a sense of being trapped.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm), ""can't even cut"" (specific self-harm method mentioned as unavailable). These are presented as a *coping mechanism* that is now blocked, not as a method for suicide.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** ""thoughts of sh"" (ongoing ideation of self-harm, not a past *suicide attempt*). No description of past *suicidal* actions.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** No active suicidal desire (""I want to die,"" ""I will kill myself"") is expressed.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""thoughts of sh"" are mentioned as existing, and the inability to act on them (due to external factors) is causing further distress. This is presented as a coping mechanism, not as an active desire to die.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The statement ""I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best"" indicates a practical barrier to a coping mechanism (self-harm), rather than a rejection of suicidal intent. However, crucial for classification, there is no explicit suicidal intent *to reject*. The ""thoughts of sh"" are framed as a way to cope, not as a desire to die.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""never felt like that's been an option"" (historical context of not opening up).
    *   **Present intent:** ""It's getting to be too much."" No present *suicidal* intent.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""I think I would go insane"" (hypothetical future if boyfriend leaves). No future suicidal ideation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. ""Thoughts of sh"" is ideation, not an attempt.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. There is no explicit suicide intent. The mention of ""sh"" and ""cut"" is in the context of a coping mechanism, not a stated desire to die.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. There is no explicit wish to die (""want to die,"" ""don't deserve to live""). The distress is high, and self-harm is mentioned as a coping mechanism, but not as a means to end life.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post is overwhelmingly focused on general unhappiness, hopelessness, and despair. While ""thoughts of sh"" are present, they are framed as an unavailable coping mechanism, not as an active suicidal desire or plan. There is no expression of active suicidal desire. This fits the ""Distress without actionable suicide intent"" definition of Indicator.

**Category Definitions with Key Clarifications Review:**
*   **Indicator:** ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" - This strongly applies. ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" - This also applies. The mention of ""thoughts of sh"" is a significant indicator of risk and distress, but without an explicit desire to die, it remains within the scope of Indicator according to the provided definitions. It's distress, not actionable suicide intent.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt/behavior).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not directly applicable as there's no explicit suicidal thought to reject. The ""can't cut"" is a practical barrier to a coping mechanism, not a rejection of suicidal intent.

**Final Decision:** The post conveys profound distress, depression, and a sense of being overwhelmed, including thoughts of self-harm as a coping mechanism. However, it lacks any explicit statement of suicidal desire or intent to die.

    *   **Specific methods:** None explicitly stated.
    *   **Preparations:** ""finally decided to take the leap"" implies a firm decision has been made, suggesting imminent action. ""goodbye"" is a strong farewell, often indicating a final act.
    *   **Past actions:** ""you guys helped me stay here about a month longer"" indicates past suicidal ideation or crisis, but not a past *attempt* (concrete self-harm).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself."" This is a direct statement of intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No rejection of the thoughts/intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""helped me stay here about a month longer"" refers to past support, not a past suicide action.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself."" This is a present decision and intent. The ""goodbye"" implies immediate or very near-future action.
    *   **Future ideation:** No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

        *   **Specific method:** No.
        *   **Preparation/Immediacy:** The phrase ""finally decided to take the leap"" indicates a firm decision leading to action. The ""goodbye"" is a very strong indicator of an imminent timeline and finality, acting as a preparation/farewell. This combination meets the criteria for ""imminent timeline"" and ""preparation evidence"" (the decision itself, and the farewell note).

**Conclusion:** The post clearly expresses active suicidal desire (""kill myself""), a firm decision (""finally decided""), and a strong indicator of immediacy/finality (""goodbye""). This combination moves it beyond mere ideation into the Behavior category.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** No, there's active suicidal desire and implied action.
*   **Ideation:** No, because there's a firm decision (""finally decided"") and a clear farewell (""goodbye"") which indicates more than just a wish; it points to an imminent plan or action.
*   **Behavior:** Yes. While no specific method is named, the explicit intent combined with the ""finally decided"" and ""goodbye"" clearly indicates an imminent timeline and preparation (the decision to act and the farewell). This aligns with the ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"" as ""goodbye"" strongly implies immediate intent.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I will hang myself now"", ""kill me with it""
*   **Indirect death references:** None.
*   **Emotional markers:** ""don't want to be alone anymore"", ""makes me sick"", ""scared to go out"", ""nobody has ever liked me"", ""made fun of me and used me"" (hopelessness, isolation, worthlessness, fear).
*   **Specific methods:** ""hang myself""
*   **Preparations:** ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie"" (active search for means).
*   **Past actions:** ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" (indicates past self-harm, but not explicitly a *suicide attempt* as defined, which requires ""actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" or ""tried to/attempted""). This phrase alone doesn't meet the strict ""Attempt"" criteria.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""I will hang myself now."" (Clear, active intent).
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted?** No.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Present intent:** ""I will hang myself now"", ""I'm now looking for something"" (Immediate timeline).

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   Start here →
*   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" is too vague to be classified as a past *suicide attempt* under the given definition (which requires ""description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" or ""tried to/attempted""). It indicates past self-harm, but not necessarily an attempt to die. So, no.
*   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
    *   Explicit suicide intent: ""I will hang myself now"" (Yes)
    *   Specific method: ""hang myself"" (Yes)
    *   Preparation: ""looking for something that I can tie"" (Yes)
    *   Immediate timeline: ""now"" (Yes)
    *   All conditions are met. This points to **BEHAVIOR**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** No, there is explicit suicidal desire and a plan/immediacy.
*   **Ideation:** No, there is a specific method, preparation, and immediate timeline.
*   **Behavior:** This category fits perfectly.
    *   ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"" -> ""hang myself"" (Yes)
    *   ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note"" -> ""looking for something that I can tie"" (Yes)
    *   ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"" -> ""now"" (Yes)
    *   ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"" -> ""I will hang myself now"" qualifies.
*   **Attempt:** No, the post describes a *current* intent and action, not a *past* concrete action with suicidal intent.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No clear ""Attempt"" to override ""Behavior"". The current intent is paramount.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** ""now"" clearly indicates immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection present.
5.  **Output exactly one:** 'behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

    *   **Emotional markers:** ""shattered,"" ""shitty,"" ""miserable,"" ""can barely function,"" ""ripped apart,"" ""can't stop shaking,"" ""How am I supposed to live like this?"" - These clearly indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and emotional pain.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The post explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This is a clear *rejection* of active suicidal desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted?** Yes, ""It's not even that I just want to die.""

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No, explicit intent is *rejected*.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No, explicit desire is *rejected*.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post contains significant distress and explicitly rejects the idea of wanting to die.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** This is the key rule here. The statement ""It's not even that I just want to die"" is a clear rejection of suicidal intent, which downgrades the risk from potential ideation to indicator, despite the high level of distress.
*   **Output exactly one:** Will do.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post conveys profound distress, misery, and difficulty functioning. However, it explicitly negates any desire to die (""It's not even that I just want to die.""). This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition, which includes general unhappiness, hopelessness, despair, and rejected thoughts/no expressions of active suicidal desire.

    *   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness (""Hate this rat race,"" ""can't handle it,"" ""don't see the need,"" ""Tf is this life?""), despair, feeling overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""I just want to kill myself"" is a direct and active statement of suicidal desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal or rejection of the thought.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No past actions or attempts mentioned.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I just want to kill myself."" The phrase ""I want out now"" strongly implies an immediate desire to escape the situation, which, when combined with the explicit suicide reference, suggests an immediate intent for the suicidal act.
    *   **Future ideation:** No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""I just want to kill myself"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: Yes, ""I want out now"" directly follows and reinforces the suicidal desire, indicating an imminent desire to end the situation through suicide. This aligns with the ""Behavior"" definition's ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"" and the clarification for ""Ideation"" that it ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"".

    *   **Category Definitions Check:**
        *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit active suicidal desire.
        *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the ""now"" indicates an immediate timeline, pushing it beyond general ideation.
        *   **Behavior:** Fits. There is explicit suicide intent (""I just want to kill myself"") combined with an implied imminent timeline (""I want out now""). The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" ""I want out now"" functions as an expression of immediate intent when paired with the desire to kill oneself.
        *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

    *   **IRREDUCIBLE RULES:**
        *   1. Writer-focused: Yes.
        *   2. Temporal hierarchy: N/A (no attempt).
        *   3. Immediacy trumps: ""I want out now"" trumps simple ideation.
        *   4. Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.
        *   5. Output exactly one: Will output 'behavior'.

The combination of explicit suicidal ideation (""I just want to kill myself"") with a clear statement of immediate desire to escape the situation (""I want out now"") indicates an imminent timeline, even without a specific method. This classifies it as Behavior.

121,"Are we going? AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE. It's the truth, you choose to not face the reality of the situation. You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (misspelling of 'die'), ""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicidal courage and determination"", ""if you change your mind and you want to do it"" (referring to suicide).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""Go out with bang, and big flames"" (metaphorical for a dramatic end, linked to suicide context).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""DEPRESSED"", ""frightened"", ""coward"", ""Everyone hates themselves"".
    *   **Specific methods:** ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"" (for mayhem), ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home"", ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best"" (these are methods for causing destruction/mayhem, framed as the way to ""go out"").
    *   **Preparations:** ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also."" ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best."" These are concrete steps described for executing the destructive act.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I WANT TO DOIE"" is a direct statement of desire. The later section, ""If you change your mind and you want to do it... Go out with bang, and big flames,"" while addressing a hypothetical ""you,"" provides advice and encouragement for a destructive suicidal act, suggesting the writer's own active consideration or endorsement of such an act.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction..."" This phrase initially presents thoughts as passive, but it's immediately followed by a challenge (""You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward..."") which pushes towards action, rather than rejecting the thoughts.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The statement ""You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward"" is not a true rejection of suicidal intent. Instead, it acts as a taunt or challenge, implicitly urging the person (or the writer themselves) to overcome this perceived cowardice and act. This is immediately followed by explicit instructions on how to ""go out with a bang,"" negating any sense of disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I WANT TO DOIE.""
    *   **Future ideation/planning:** The detailed instructions (""Learn how to make nitroglycerin,"" ""research where to find the parts,"" ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants"") describe actionable steps for a future destructive act linked to suicide, even without an immediate timeline like ""tonight.""

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""I WANT TO DOIE."" and the framing of ""going out with a bang"" as a response to suicidal desire.
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** Yes. The post describes specific methods (making nitroglycerin, using wire cutters, attacking a power plant) and preparations (learning, researching parts, visiting a location) for a destructive act that is explicitly linked to ending one's life (""Go out with bang, and big flames"" after ""If you change your mind and you want to do it""). While the methods involve external destruction, they are presented as the *means* of the writer's own end. This constitutes capability and preparation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No explicit immediate timeline, but the detailed preparation is sufficient to qualify for Behavior.

    *   This post goes beyond mere ideation because it provides concrete, actionable steps (preparation) for a specific, destructive method of ending one's life, framed within the context of suicidal desire. The ""rejection"" is a challenge, not a true disavowal.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, analysis focuses on the writer's expressed thoughts and plans.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt mentioned).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No explicit immediacy, but detailed preparation is present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The ""rejection"" is a challenge, not a true disavowal, and is immediately followed by instructions for action. The initial ""I WANT TO DOIE"" is strong.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will ensure this.

The combination of explicit suicidal desire (""I WANT TO DOIE"") and detailed, actionable preparations for a destructive act (even if the destruction is external, it's presented as the means of the writer's own end) clearly places this in the **Behavior** category.

On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** The phrase ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself"" is present, but it is quoted speech from the *bully* to the *friend*, not an expression of the writer's or the friend's suicidal intent.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you"" - again, quoted speech from the *bully*, not an expression of the writer's or friend's suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional markers:** The writer describes the friend as ""mentally disturbing,"" ""constantly tired,"" ""overwhelmed,"" ""not doing well,"" ""not eating and not going out."" These indicate significant distress, but not explicitly *suicidal* distress.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned by the writer or attributed to the friend.
    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned by the writer or attributed to the friend.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned by the writer or attributed to the friend.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The *writer* is expressing concern for their friend and seeking ""Bully payback help"" and ""Justice."" The writer is *not* expressing suicidal thoughts or intent for themselves.
    *   **Passive experience:** No passive suicidal thoughts from the writer.
    *   **Rejection noted?** Not applicable to the writer's intent.
    *   **Writer-focused rule:** This is crucial. The post is about the *friend's* experience of bullying and distress. The ""go kill yourself"" phrase is from the *bully*. The writer is reporting on the friend's general distress, but does not state that the friend has suicidal intent or plans.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: The bullying ""is going on 5 days now."" The friend ""has been constantly tired.""
    *   Present intent: The writer is asking ""can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)?""
    *   Future ideation: Not present.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. The writer does not express suicide intent, nor do they explicitly state the friend has such intent with a plan or timeline.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. The writer does not express a wish to die, nor do they explicitly state the friend has such a wish. The quoted ""go kill yourself"" is from the bully, not the friend.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post describes significant distress experienced by the *friend* (""mentally disturbing,"" ""constantly tired,"" ""overwhelmed,"" ""not doing well""). While a suicide-related phrase (""go kill yourself"") is present, it is attributed to the *bully* and not an expression of suicidal desire or intent from the writer or the friend. The writer's primary intent is to seek help for the bullying situation. The friend's symptoms are indicative of distress, but not explicitly suicidal ideation or behavior.

    **Irreducible Rules Check:**
    1.  **Writer-focused:** The writer is not expressing suicidal intent. The distress described is of the friend, and the suicidal phrase is from the bully.
    2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempts, behavior, or ideation are present.
    3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
    4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable, as no active suicidal thoughts were expressed to be rejected.
    5.  **Output exactly one:** Will be 'indicator'.

The post describes general distress in the friend due to severe bullying, but it does not contain any active expressions of suicidal desire, plans, or past attempts from the writer, nor does the writer explicitly state that the friend has such intent. The suicide reference is external (from the bully). Therefore, it falls under distress without actionable suicide intent.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""I want to kill myself"", ""suicide is on my mind everyday"", ""I want to hang myself so bad."" The writer claims ownership of these thoughts and desires.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** The phrase ""I just am holding on a bit because I have a small piece of hope left in me"" indicates a *reason for not acting immediately*, but it is *not* an explicit disavowal or rejection of the suicidal thoughts/desire itself. The desire to ""hang myself so bad"" remains very strong and active. This does not trigger the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""tried to reach out"" (seeking help). No past suicide attempts.
    *   **Present intent:** ""suicide is on my mind everyday"", ""I want to hang myself so bad."" This indicates current, active ideation and desire.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""I really don't know how much longer I could last here on earth"" suggests a potential future action if circumstances don't change, but it's not an immediate timeline.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (""tried to reach out"" is not an attempt).
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""I want to kill myself"", ""I want to hang myself so bad"").
        *   **Specific method:** Yes (""hang myself"").
        *   **Preparation:** No.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No.

    According to the decision tree, if there is ""Explicit suicide intent"" AND a ""specific method"" (even without preparation or immediate timeline), it falls under **BEHAVIOR**.

    Let's confirm with definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is active suicidal desire and a specific method, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the method (""hang myself"") is *specific/actionable*, not non-actionable.
    *   **Behavior:** ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"" - ""hang myself"" fits this. The definition states ""Intent + Capability"" and lists ""Specific method stated"" as a qualifying factor. The ""OR"" in the definition means only one of the sub-criteria (specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline) is needed *in addition to intent*.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

    The presence of specific intent (""I want to kill myself"", ""I want to hang myself so bad"") combined with a specific method (""hang myself"") classifies this as **Behavior**. The hope mentioned is a mitigating factor that might prevent immediate action, but it doesn't negate the active intent and specific method that are clearly present.

    *   Passive experience: N/A
    *   Rejection noted? ""but I found one thing to live for so I guess ill stay alive."" This is a *partial* and *tentative* rejection of future attempts, but it does *not* negate the past attempts or the explicit present desire (""still want to attempt again""). The ""Rejection downgrade"" rule applies when thoughts are *only* rejected/intrusive, which is not the case here given the explicit past actions and present desire.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""last night I attempted once again"", ""this makes it like what my 15th time?"". This is very prominent.
    *   Present intent: ""still want to attempt again"". This indicates ongoing suicidal desire.
    *   Future ideation: ""I guess ill stay alive"" (a conditional, tentative future decision).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → **YES**. The post explicitly states ""last night I attempted once again"" and ""this makes it like what my 15th time?"".

    *   According to the decision tree, the presence of a past suicide attempt immediately classifies the post as **ATTEMPT**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Attempt**: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" - Yes, ""I attempted once again"". ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"" - N/A. ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned"" - Yes, the past attempt takes precedence over the ""still want to attempt again"" (ideation/behavior) and the conditional ""I guess ill stay alive"". ""Clarification: 'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt"" - Yes, this matches perfectly.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. The description of a past attempt is the highest priority.
3.  Immediacy trumps: N/A, as the primary classification is driven by a past event.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The rejection is conditional and does not negate the explicit past attempts or the present desire to attempt again. It does not downgrade to 'indicator'.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output 'attempt'.

Based on the explicit mention of past suicide attempts, the classification is clear.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I'm at the end of my rope right now."" (Metaphorical for extreme distress). ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through."" (Directly implies a suicidal act being considered/attempted). ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" (Explicit wish for death, tied to current state of falling asleep).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""I can feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting"" (Physical symptoms of distress, potentially anxiety/panic). ""I can feel myself falling asleep, but as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" (Falling asleep with a desire not to wake up).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""Everything's crumbling,"" ""don't see a reason,"" ""scared,"" ""sad,"" ""alone,"" ""can't reach out,"" ""don't want to put them through something as scary as this."" (Hopelessness, despair, fear, isolation, burden).
    *   **Specific methods:** None explicitly stated.
    *   **Preparations:** None explicitly stated.
    *   **Past actions:** ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" (Refers to past instances of falling asleep/losing consciousness in a similar context, where the outcome was waking up. This is ambiguous regarding actual self-harm, but suggests a history of similar states/actions where not waking up was a possibility or desire).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" (Clear, active desire). ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through."" (Implies an active desire to ""go all the way through"" but fear is preventing it).
    *   **Passive experience:** Not primarily passive.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** ""I know I'll wake up later,"" ""I know I'll wake up."" (Repeated prediction of waking up, based on past experience, but this is a statement of *expected outcome* rather than an explicit *rejection* of the desire not to wake up. The ""deep, deep down"" phrasing indicates the desire is present despite the expectation of waking). The fear (""too scared to go all the way through"") prevents action, but doesn't negate the underlying desire.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""as I've done this before,"" ""I knew this morning... I've thought about it all day."" (History of similar states/ideation).
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm at the end of my rope right now."" ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through."" ""I can feel myself falling asleep,"" ""I hope I don't wake up."" (Immediate desire and current state).
    *   **Future ideation:** ""please check up on me later."" (Request for future support).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
        *   The phrase ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" is ambiguous. While it suggests a history of similar situations where the user fell asleep/lost consciousness with a desire not to wake up, it does not explicitly describe ""actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" as required by the 'Attempt' definition. It could refer to passive actions or states of distress rather than active self-harm. Therefore, we cannot definitively classify as 'Attempt'.

    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → BEHAVIOR**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"" is an explicit wish for death. ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through"" indicates an active consideration of a suicidal act.
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** No specific method or preparation is detailed.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes, the intent (""I hope I don't wake up"") is tied to the immediate present state (""I can feel myself falling asleep""). The consideration of ""going all the way through"" is also presented as a present, ongoing struggle. The ""Critical expansion"" for BEHAVIOR states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" The passive immediate intent (""I hope I don't wake up"" while falling asleep *now*) combined with the active consideration of ""going all the way through"" (even if prevented by fear) indicates an imminent risk. This goes beyond mere ideation by tying the suicidal desire to an immediate physical state and an active, albeit feared, consideration of an act.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → IDEATION**
        *   While there is explicit suicide desire, the presence of an immediate timeline (""I can feel myself falling asleep"" with the hope not to wake up from *this* sleep) and the active consideration of ""going all the way through"" (even if fear prevents it) moves it beyond simple 'Ideation'.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → INDICATOR**
        *   No, there are clear expressions of active suicidal desire and immediate intent, not just distress or rejected thoughts. The prediction of waking up is not a rejection of the desire.

**Conclusion:** The post demonstrates clear, immediate suicidal intent (""I hope I don't wake up"") tied to a current physical state (""falling asleep""), along with the active consideration of a suicidal act (""go all the way through"") despite fear. This combination of immediate intent and active consideration of an act, even without a specific method, aligns with the 'Behavior' category's emphasis on immediate risk.

*   **Indirect death references:** ""Too late to turn back now!"", ""I won't have anymore chances"", ""I have ran out of chances.""
*   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness (""true failure"", ""no more savings"", ""my room is empty"", ""everything is gone""), resignation (""it all doesn't matter to me"", ""The risk is worth the reward"").
*   **Specific methods:** ""loaded gun"", ""shoot myself.""
*   **Preparations:** ""writing this with a loaded gun by my side"", ""Every other account is gone, deleted"", ""no more savings, my room is empty, everything is gone."" These indicate final preparations and a clearing of affairs.
*   **Past actions:** ""I never did it"" (refers to past *intent* not acted upon, explicitly stating no past attempt). ""tried to help"" (refers to others' actions, ignored per rule 1).

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer states ""I am going to shoot myself,"" ""I am not giving myself anymore chances,"" and ""I am not going to make any excuses anymore."" This is clear, active intent.
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** No. The post is an active declaration of intent, not a rejection of thoughts.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** Mentions past intent (""Been writing here since June, with the intent to kill myself. I never did it.""), but this is historical context for the *current* state.
*   **Present intent:** ""Not until now. I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side... I am going to shoot myself."" This is strong, immediate present intent.
*   **Future ideation:** Not primary. The focus is on immediate action.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   Start here →
*   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. The post explicitly states ""I never did it.""
*   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → Yes.

    *   **Immediate timeline:** ""Not until now"", ""once I post this"", ""Too late to turn back now!"". The overall tone is one of imminent finality.

This clearly falls under the **Behavior** category. It demonstrates explicit intent, a specific method, evidence of preparation, and an imminent timeline.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Not applicable. Goes far beyond general distress.
*   **Ideation:** Not applicable. It's more than just a wish; it's an actionable plan.
*   **Behavior:** Fits perfectly. ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"" (Yes, ""loaded gun"", ""shoot myself""). ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note"" (Yes, ""writing this with a loaded gun by my side"", clearing accounts/belongings). ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"" (Yes, ""Not until now"", ""once I post this"", ""Too late to turn back now!""). ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"" (This post has both immediate intent *and* method/preparation).
*   **Attempt:** Not applicable. Describes *current* intent and preparation, not a *past* completed action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all analysis is on the writer's actions/intent. Ignored ""To the people who tried to help"".
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No past attempt, strong current behavior.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** The immediacy (""Not until now"", ""once I post this"", ""Too late to turn back now!"") combined with method and preparation strongly points to Behavior.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The post describes a deliberate action taken with suicidal intent: ""i had a suicide episode which made me leave a note... then i got to the bathroom grabbed the bleach and swallowed it."" This is a clear description of an intentional act to end their life.
*   **Passive experience/Rejection noted:** While the user mentions ""every time i have suicidal episodes i can overcome them,"" they immediately follow this with a detailed account of an instance where they *did not* overcome it and acted on the suicidal thoughts. The post-event reflection (""i hope no one does the same"") does not negate the past intent of the described action.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** The entire detailed narrative is focused on an event that occurred ""a week ago."" The opening phrase ""tried to pass a week ago"" immediately sets the temporal frame.
*   **Present intent:** The post states ""im a little okay now"" and ""im doing better now,"" indicating the immediate crisis has passed, but the core event described is historical.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   Start here →
*   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → YES. The post explicitly details a past action: ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it,"" ""thought that was the last breath i have but luckily i vomited."" This directly aligns with the definition of an 'Attempt' (Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent; Includes interrupted/aborted attempts).

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, the post is entirely about the writer's own experience.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since a past attempt is clearly described, 'Attempt' takes precedence.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as the primary event is in the past.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The rejection of suicidal thoughts (""every time i have suicidal episodes i can overcome them"") is immediately contradicted by the detailed account of an *actual attempt* where they did not overcome it. The post-attempt reflection does not downgrade the classification of the past concrete action.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'attempt'.

**Category Definition Match:**
The post perfectly matches the 'Attempt' category: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" (""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it"") and ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"" (""luckily i vomited""). The opening ""tried to pass a week ago"" also explicitly points to an attempt.

    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents..."" This is a *reason for not acting*, a protective factor, but it *does not reject or disavow the active desire to die*. The desire (""I still want to die"") remains present and endorsed by the writer. This is key: it's not ""my brain tells me to die but I don't want to""; it's ""I want to die, but I'm not acting on it because of X.""

**Category Definitions Check:**

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as only ideation is present.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as no immediacy.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The statement ""The only thing stopping me..."" is a protective factor, not a rejection of the *desire* to die. The desire is still active. Therefore, no downgrade to Indicator.
5.  Output exactly one: Will do.

    *   **Past actions:** None described (e.g., ""tried to"", ""attempted"").

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer states ""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end"" and ""my end will only get nearer."" They explicitly state being ""fine with either outcome"" regarding the LSD, implying that if it doesn't help, the ""end"" (suicide) is an acceptable next step. This is not presented as an intrusive or rejected thought.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No. The acceptance of ""either outcome"" (LSD helps or not, leading to ""end getting nearer"") indicates no rejection of the suicidal path if the alternative fails.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""for months on end"" describes the duration of the ideation.
    *   **Present intent:** The current state is one of ongoing suicidal ideation (""I've only been thinking of suicide"").
    *   **Future ideation:** ""my end will only get nearer"" indicates future, non-specific timing for the potential suicide. The LSD is a present action to potentially *defer* that future.

        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" and the acceptance of ""my end will only get nearer"" if LSD doesn't work, clearly indicates an active suicidal desire.

""I see no point in living anymore"" is a direct statement about the value of life for the individual, which goes beyond general unhappiness and expresses a desire for life to end, aligning with suicidal ideation. It's not metaphorical, nor is it a rejected thought.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire."" This post *does* express a desire for life to cease (""no point in living anymore""), which is a form of suicidal desire. So, it's beyond Indicator.
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"". ""I see no point in living anymore"" is a strong expression of a wish for life to end, fitting this definition. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" is also true for the post. This is the best fit.
*   **Behavior:** No specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** No past action described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt/behavior to override.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable, no immediacy.
4.  Rejection downgrade: Not applicable, no rejection.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output 'ideation'.

The phrase ""I see no point in living anymore"" is a clear expression of suicidal ideation, even if not explicitly saying ""I want to die."" It conveys the sentiment that life is not worth living for the individual.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes. The writer states, ""So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow."" This is a direct statement of their own action with a clear suicidal outcome.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No rejection of the suicidal act. The apology is for the friend finding out, not for the act itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

    *   **Specific methods:** None explicitly stated.
    *   **Preparations:** ""planning out my suicide"" implies preparation, but no concrete action (e.g., ""bought pills"") is detailed.
    *   **Past actions:** ""fear of failing an attempt once again"" and ""intend to do it right this time"" clearly indicate a *past suicide attempt*.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Strong active endorsement. Phrases like ""I'm planning out my suicide"", ""I have no intention of anyone stopping me"", ""I intend to do it right this time"", ""I will go through with this"", and ""I am and will not be one of those people"" demonstrate clear ownership and commitment to these thoughts and plans.
    *   **Passive experience:** None.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No rejection; explicitly rejects being stopped.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""fear of failing an attempt once again"" directly references a past suicide attempt.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm planning out my suicide"", ""I have no intention of anyone stopping me"".
    *   **Future ideation:** ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest."" This is a specific, imminent future timeline.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → YES. The phrase ""fear of failing an attempt once again"" explicitly states a past attempt.
    *   According to the ""IRREDUCIBLE RULES"" (Rule 2: Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation) and the ""Attempt"" category definition (""Clarification: 'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt""), the presence of a past attempt immediately classifies the post as 'Attempt', overriding any concurrent ideation or behavior.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post explicitly mentions a ""fear of failing an attempt once again,"" which directly indicates a past suicide attempt. According to the provided framework's ""IRREDUCIBLE RULES,"" specifically ""Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation,"" and the ""Attempt"" category definition (""'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt""), the presence of a past attempt takes precedence over any current ideation or behavior described. Although there is clear evidence of current planning and a specific future timeline (which would normally lead to 'Behavior'), the past attempt is the overriding factor.

For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""100% do not want to live anymore"", ""scared to kill myself"", ""hate being alive"", ""wonder if i should just do it now"", ""wish i was never born"".
    *   Indirect death references: ""weigh down my family and friends"" (implying absence).
    *   Emotional markers: Hopelessness, despair (""hate being alive"", ""wish i was never born""). Fear (""scared to kill myself"").
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore"", ""I actually hate being alive"", ""sometimes i wonder if i should just do it now"". The desire is owned by the writer.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? ""but i am to scared to kill myself"", ""but i dont want to weigh down my family and friends"". These are rejections of the *action* due to fear and concern for others, not a rejection of the *desire to die*. The desire to die is explicitly and strongly stated as active.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: ""sometimes i wonder if i should just do it now"". This is a thought about immediate action. However, it's immediately followed by ""For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born"", which indicates a *lack of present action* and a decision to *not* act immediately.
    *   Future ideation: ""if i wait for later it will just hurt them more"".

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""100% do not want to live anymore"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: The phrase ""wonder if i should just do it now"" suggests a thought about immediacy, but the subsequent ""For now i guess i will just sit here"" explicitly states inaction, and ""i am to scared to kill myself"" indicates a significant barrier to action. This prevents it from being classified as an *imminent plan* or *intent to act now*.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes (""100% do not want to live anymore"", ""hate being alive"", ""wish i was never born"").
        *   Non-actionable methods: None specified, which fits.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes. Despite the thought of ""now,"" the post explicitly states inaction (""For now i guess i will just sit here"") and a barrier (""scared to kill myself""). This fits the ""no immediate timeline"" criterion for Ideation.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is clear active suicidal desire, not just distress or rejected thoughts. The desire to die is active, even if the action is inhibited.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a strong, active desire to die (""100% do not want to live anymore"") and considers immediate action (""wonder if i should just do it now""). However, it explicitly states barriers to acting (fear, concern for family) and confirms *current inaction* (""For now i guess i will just sit here""). This fits the definition of **Ideation** perfectly: active suicidal desire without an actionable plan or immediate intent to act. It does not qualify as Behavior because there's no specific method, preparation, or firm immediate intent to act; rather, there's a stated *inability* or *decision not to act* at this moment.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""attempt suicide"", ""hang myself"".
    *   Indirect death references: ""so i don't die"" (implies the action is typically lethal).
    *   Emotional markers: None explicit.
    *   Specific methods: ""hang myself"".
    *   Preparations: N/A (describes the act itself).
    *   Past actions: ""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently"", ""i hang myself but always leave a chair... so i don't die."" This describes repeated past actions of self-harm with suicidal intent.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I half heartedly attempt suicide"" - Yes, the writer claims ownership of these actions.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? ""so i don't die"" - This indicates an *interrupted* or *aborted* attempt, or an attempt where the full intent to complete is lacking. However, the framework's definition of ""Attempt"" specifically includes ""interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped')"". The core action is still presented as a suicide attempt.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""frequently"", ""always leave"" - describes habitual past actions.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → Yes. ""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die."" This directly fits the ""Attempt"" definition: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent. Includes interrupted/aborted attempts.""

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes, ""I"" is the subject.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since a past attempt is described, this category takes precedence.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as it's a past action.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** While ""so i don't die"" suggests an incomplete intent, the action is still explicitly called an ""attempt suicide"" and involves a specific method of self-harm. The ""Attempt"" category specifically accounts for interrupted/aborted attempts. Therefore, it is not downgraded to an Indicator.
*   **Output exactly one:** Yes.

**Final Classification:** The post describes repeated past actions of self-harm with suicidal intent, explicitly calling them ""attempt suicide,"" even though they are interrupted or not fully committed to completion. This directly aligns with the definition of ""Attempt.""

I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her.

I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for.

        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes.
        *   This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?
        *   There is distress, but ""end it all"" goes beyond mere metaphor when combined with the stated feelings.
        *   There is no explicit rejection of the suicidal thoughts; rather, the subsequent description of feeling ""doomed"" aligns with the desire to ""end it all.""
        *   Therefore, not INDICATOR.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire (""end it all"").
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'end it all'"" and ""No preparation or immediate timeline.""
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of past self-harm.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No Attempt or Behavior, so Ideation is the highest applicable.
3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No explicit rejection. The post indicates alignment with the thoughts as a solution to distress.

140,"Just another rant. Keep scrolling. Don't waste your time on a lost cause. I'm almost 30. Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time. I am just a  Useless, shameless, pathetic loser. Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful. I am a useless piece of garbage. Oh wait, garbage can be recycled or made into something. My miserable ass is is as useless as the shit that comes out of it.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful."" (Implies life is a waste, questioning existence).
*   **Indirect death references:** ""lost cause"", ""useless, shameless, pathetic loser"", ""useless piece of garbage"", ""miserable ass is as useless as the shit that comes out of it."" (Extreme self-worthlessness, often associated with suicidal ideation).
*   **Emotional markers:** ""Suffering from depression and anxiety"", ""hate the line of career"", ""hate the stupid decisions"", ""no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals"", ""peculiar dysfunction in my eyes"", ""family would never understand"", ""mental illness is a hoax"", ""daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell"", ""hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like"", ""best friend distanced herself"", ""miserable ass"". (Overwhelming hopelessness, worthlessness, self-hatred, isolation, despair, unbearable pain).
*   **Specific methods:** ""drown myself"", ""hang"", ""jump off from the 4th floor"".
*   **Preparations:** Not explicitly stated as *current* preparations, but the *attempts* imply past actions leading to these methods.
*   **Past actions:** ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in."" (Clear descriptions of past, concrete actions taken with suicidal intent).

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The questioning ""Why should I still live"" indicates active suicidal ideation. The self-hatred and descriptions of past actions show a strong, persistent desire for self-harm/death.
*   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
*   **Rejection noted?** ""But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time."" This is a description of *aborted* attempts, not a rejection of the *desire* to die or a disavowal of suicidal thoughts. The author frames it as a personal failing (""coward"") for not completing the act, implying the desire to die persists. This does *not* trigger the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule, as the user is not saying ""I don't actually want to"" but rather ""I failed to do what I wanted to do.""

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off..."" (Describes past actions).
*   **Present intent:** ""Why should I still live..."" (Present questioning of life's value, indicating ongoing ideation).
*   **Future ideation:** Not explicitly stated.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **Start here →**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly states: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in.""
    *   The definition for **Attempt** clearly includes ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped')"". The phrase ""chickened out each time"" directly aligns with an aborted attempt.
    *   The ""IRREDUCIBLE RULES"" state: ""Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned.""

Therefore, despite the presence of current ideation and extreme distress, the explicit mention of past, aborted attempts places this post firmly in the 'Attempt' category.

    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **Past actions:** ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old."" This describes a *hypothetical past desire/ideation*, not an actual past attempt. The wording ""would have been gone"" indicates a condition (""If suicide wasn't damn hard"") that prevented it, not an actual action taken.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer states ""Living is not for me"", ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"", and ""I might actually get the courage to do it."" These are active expressions of personal desire and growing intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No. The phrase ""If suicide wasn't damn hard"" describes a barrier, but the subsequent ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself...I might actually get the courage to do it"" indicates a *strengthening* of intent, not a rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

    *   **Present intent:** ""Living is not for me"", ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"".
    *   **Future ideation:** ""I might actually get the courage to do it."" This indicates a potential future action, but without a specific timeline or plan.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"", ""I might actually get the courage to do it"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (""I might actually get the courage to do it"" is future-oriented and non-immediate, not ""tonight"" or ""right now"").

        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes (""Living is not for me"", ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"").
        *   Non-actionable methods: N/A (no methods mentioned, but if they were, they'd be non-actionable as per lack of plan/immediacy).
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes.
        *   This perfectly matches the definition of IDEATION.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear active suicidal desire.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt is described.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as no immediacy is present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable as there is no rejection of the suicidal thoughts.

These phrases collectively express a profound desire for cessation of current existence and a sense of meaninglessness, which can be interpreted as an implicit wish for death. ""Want to give up"" in this context, surrounded by existential despair, goes beyond a simple metaphor.

    *   **Past actions:** No past suicide attempts mentioned. References to past abuse/struggle are general life history.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer expresses ""I want to give up"" and questions their existence (""Why the fuck am I alive and existing... My life has no worth. No meaning.""). These are active expressions of a desire for an end to their current state of being/existence, rather than passive or intrusive thoughts.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal of these thoughts. The writer expresses guilt for *feeling* this way, but not a rejection of the desire itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes long-term struggle (""since I was a child"") and past abuse, but no past suicide attempts.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing,"" ""My life has no worth. No meaning."" These are present statements of desire/feeling.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future plans or timing for action.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. While there's strong intent for cessation of existence, it lacks the ""capability"" or ""imminence"" required for Behavior.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → This fits. The phrases ""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"", and ""My life has no worth. No meaning."" collectively constitute an explicit wish to cease existing or an active suicidal desire, even if not using the exact words ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" The desire for life to end is clearly conveyed through the questioning of existence and the declaration of life's worthlessness. There is no plan or immediate timeline.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No. While there is significant distress, the language used (""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive,"" ""My life has no worth. No meaning."") goes beyond mere metaphor or general unhappiness. It points to an active desire for an end to life/existence, which is the core of ideation.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear, active desire for an end to life/existence (""want to give up,"" questioning why they are alive, stating life has ""no worth. No meaning"") without any specific plan, method, or immediate timeline. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

    *   Indirect death references: ""pass away"".
    *   Emotional markers: ""cushion the pain"" (suggests underlying distress/pain), desire to ""look like a fucking skeleton"" (extreme, disturbing).
    *   Specific methods: Anorexia/starvation to a specific lethal weight (""weigh 90 pounds, but my new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me""). This is a concrete, self-destructive method.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

    *   Present intent: The post describes an ongoing process (""I currently weigh 90 pounds"") with a clear present intent to continue a self-destructive path to death (""my new goal weight is 78 pounds... for it to finally kill me""). While the method is ""slowly,"" the intent and the specific lethal goal are present and active.
    *   Future ideation: The ""goal weight"" is a future target, but it's part of a current, active, lethal plan.

        *   Preparation: Yes, setting a specific ""goal weight"" with the explicit purpose of death.
        *   Immediate timeline: Not ""tonight"" or ""right now,"" but the presence of a specific method and preparation is sufficient for ""Behavior"" according to the definition (""Specific method stated"" OR ""Preparation evidence""). The ""slowly kill myself"" indicates an ongoing, active plan, not just a fleeting thought.

    *   This clearly fits the criteria for **BEHAVIOR**. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the specific method (starvation to a lethal weight) and the clear preparation (setting that lethal goal weight).

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post demonstrates explicit suicidal intent (""slowly kill myself,"" ""finally kill me"") combined with a specific method (starvation to a lethal weight of 78 lbs or lower) and clear preparation (setting this lethal goal weight). While the timeline is ""slowly,"" the presence of a concrete method and preparation moves it beyond ""Ideation"" and into ""Behavior"" as per the framework's definition: ""Behavior (Intent + Capability)"" and ""Specific method stated"" or ""Preparation evidence.""

The user post is: ""Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?""

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** The word ""suicide"" is explicitly used.
*   **Indirect death references:** N/A
*   **Emotional markers:** N/A (This is a factual question, not an emotional statement).
*   **Specific methods:** ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" implies carbon monoxide poisoning, which is a specific method.
*   **Preparations:** N/A (The post asks about possibility, not about acquiring means or making preparations).
*   **Past actions:** N/A

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The question ""Is it possible to suicide from X?"" implies an active consideration or exploration of the act of suicide using a specific method. It's not a passive thought or a rejected thought. The inquiry itself demonstrates an active engagement with the idea of suicide and its practicalities.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Present intent:** The question is posed in the present tense, inquiring about a current possibility. There is no past focus or future ideation explicitly stated.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** The word ""suicide"" is used, and the question about its possibility with a specific method indicates active consideration of the act.
    *   **Specific method:** ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a specific method.
    *   **Preparation/Immediate timeline:** No explicit preparation or immediate timeline is mentioned.

    The key here is whether ""Is it possible to suicide from X?"" constitutes ""explicit suicide intent"" when combined with a ""specific method.""
    The ""Behavior"" category definition includes ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"". While the post is a question, it *names* a specific method in the context of suicide. This moves beyond general ideation (a wish to die) into exploring the *capability* and *mechanics* of suicide using a concrete method. It's an active inquiry into how to achieve suicide with a specific means. This level of specificity and inquiry into a method aligns more closely with the ""Behavior"" category's emphasis on intent + capability, even without an immediate timeline or direct declaration of intent to act *right now*. The act of *inquiring* about a specific method for suicide demonstrates a significant step beyond mere ideation.

*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** This doesn't fit perfectly. While there's no immediate plan, the specificity of the method inquiry goes beyond a general ""wish to die"" which is characteristic of Ideation. Ideation typically involves non-actionable methods or vague desires. This post involves a concrete, specific method.

*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, this is clearly about suicide with a specific method, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.

**Conclusion:** The presence of ""suicide"" and a ""specific method"" (charcoal bbq in a tent) in an active inquiry about its possibility indicates a serious exploration of means, which aligns with the ""Behavior"" category's emphasis on intent and capability, even if an immediate timeline or explicit ""I will do it"" statement is absent. It's a step beyond simply wishing to die.

        *   ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"" - The statement ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" directly matches this definition. The feeling of wanting to die is present, but the *active intent* to *act* on it is explicitly rejected.
        *   ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" - This point needs careful interpretation with the rejection rule. The presence of ""makes me want to die"" is an *expression of desire*, but the *active, actionable suicidal desire* is explicitly negated by the subsequent rejection. The ""Rejection downgrade"" rule (""I don't actually want to"" → indicator) confirms this interpretation.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade: ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator.** This rule is paramount. The phrase ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" directly triggers this rule, overriding the preceding expression of desire.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will ensure this.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post expresses significant emotional distress, self-loathing, and a feeling of wanting to die (""makes me want to die""). However, it crucially includes an explicit rejection of active suicidal intent: ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" According to the framework's ""Rejection downgrade"" rule and the definition of ""Indicator"" (specifically ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts""), this explicit disavowal places the post in the Indicator category, despite the strong feelings of despair and desire for absence.

147,My heart hurts and I want to die. My long term bf and I got into a bad fight. All because I thought I asked a harmless question and it spiraled. Usually when we fight we always end positively but this time it felt different. It ended badly. It was more let's just forget this happened. We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time. I loved him so much and felt so lucky to be with him. I don't really know what to do. I'm just passively letting whatever happen happen. I don't care. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down. It hurts so much and I just feel like dying. I just wish I had someone to talk to,1,ideation,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I want to die"", ""I feel like I don't want to live"", ""I just feel like dying"".
*   **Indirect death references:** None.
*   **Emotional markers:** ""My heart hurts"", ""bad fight"", ""spiraled"", ""ended badly"", ""relationship feels damaged"", ""don't know what to do"", ""passively letting whatever happen happen"", ""I don't care"", ""worst person"", ""hurts so much"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and pain.
*   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
*   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **Past actions (suicide-related):** None mentioned.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** Yes, the writer explicitly states ""I want to die"", ""I feel like I don't want to live"", and ""I just feel like dying"". These are active expressions of desire.
*   **Passive experience:** No, these are not presented as intrusive or unwelcome thoughts.
*   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal. The final sentence ""I just wish I had someone to talk to"" is a cry for help, but it does not reject the suicidal thoughts themselves.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** The fight is in the past, but the suicidal feelings are present.
*   **Present intent:** The desire to die is expressed as a current feeling (""I want to die"", ""I feel like I don't want to live"").
*   **Future ideation:** No specific future timing or non-specific timing like ""someday"". The intent is current.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **Start here →**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
    *   No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → BEHAVIOR**
    *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""I want to die"", ""I feel like I don't want to live"").
    *   Specific method/preparation: No.
    *   Immediate timeline: No (""tonight"", ""right now"").
    *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → IDEATION**
    *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""I want to die"", ""I feel like I don't want to live"", ""I just feel like dying"").
    *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline is mentioned.
    *   This matches the definition of IDEATION.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → INDICATOR**
    *   No, there are clear expressions of active suicidal desire, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.

**Category Definitions with Key Clarifications Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *are* expressions of active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Matches perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"" is present. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" is also true.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of past self-harm.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, analysis is solely on the writer's statements.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as only ideation is present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as there is no immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal thoughts. The desire for someone to talk to is a cry for help, not a disavowal of the suicidal ideation.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'ideation'.

The post clearly expresses an active desire to die multiple times, but without any mention of a specific plan, method, preparations, or an immediate timeline. This aligns directly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

148,"3 weeks TW(animal abuse-sexual assault-murder). I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. it doesn't help having this bullshit thing women have every month. But I can't do it anymore. Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down."" - This is a clear, sustained metaphor for self-euthanasia/suicide, where the ""dog"" represents the self.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""I can't do it anymore."" (general despair, but not a direct death reference on its own). ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around."" (implies an end if things don't improve).
    *   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness (""Nothing's real to me anymore,"" ""I can't find a way to release,"" ""I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything.""), worthlessness (""My trauma isn't bad enough to be here,"" ""I'm an abomination""), unbearable pain/distress (description of abuse, feeling tired of fighting, dogs crying, wanting bad things to happen to self).
    *   **Specific methods:** None for self-harm/suicide. (The desire to stab someone is external, not self-directed).
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** No past suicide attempts described.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The ""put down"" metaphor is presented as an eventual outcome for the self if conditions don't improve. The phrase ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around"" implies a conditional, active intent to end things if the condition isn't met. There's no rejection of the ""put down"" idea.
    *   **Passive experience:** The ""brain forces me to think I have it"" refers to illnesses/disabilities, not suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal of the suicidal thought. The ""3 weeks"" is a condition for *not* acting, not a rejection of the desire to ""be put down.""

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None related to suicide.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I can't do it anymore.""
    *   **Future ideation:** ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around."" and ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down."" This indicates a future, conditional, non-immediate timeframe for the suicidal thought.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, the ""put down"" metaphor and the 3-week conditional deadline.
        *   Specific method/preparation: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing note) is mentioned for suicide.
        *   Immediate timeline: No. The ""3 weeks"" is a future deadline, not an *immediate* timeline like ""tonight"" or ""right now.""
        *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, conveyed through the ""put down"" metaphor and the ""can't do it anymore"" combined with the 3-week ultimatum.
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, there is no specific method or immediate timeline. The 3-week period is a future condition.
        *   This aligns with the definition of IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This is not the case because there's an active, albeit metaphorical, expression of wanting to ""put myself down"" and a conditional deadline, indicating more than just distress or rejected thoughts.

**Category Definitions Check:**

*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is active suicidal desire (even if metaphorical) and a conditional future intent, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. There is an ""explicit wish to die"" (via the ""put down"" metaphor) and ""no preparation or immediate timeline."" The ""3 weeks"" is a non-immediate, conditional timeframe.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or *imminent* timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempt is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable, no attempt.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** The ""3 weeks"" is not immediate, so it doesn't push it to Behavior.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life.

These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, despair, feeling trapped, and lack of purpose.
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** None related to suicide.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** No. The post begins with an explicit rejection: ""I don't want to kill myself.""
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** Yes, ""I don't want to kill myself"" and ""I really want to give life a chance.""

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** Describes past stagnation (""graduated college almost 2 years ago,"" ""pushed all my friends away,"" ""always been a melancholic guy"").
*   **Present intent:** No present suicidal intent. Expresses current feelings of despair and being stuck.
*   **Future ideation:** No future suicidal ideation. Expresses desire for a better future (""want to have a job,"" ""meet new people,"" ""give life a chance,"" ""financial independence, a girlfriend, hobbies"").

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   Start here →
*   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
*   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. The post explicitly states ""I don't want to kill myself.""
*   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. The post explicitly states ""I don't want to kill myself.""
*   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post is filled with expressions of general unhappiness, hopelessness, and despair (""literally nothing going for me,"" ""nothing is going to change,"" ""walls are closing in""). Crucially, it includes a clear rejection of suicidal intent (""I don't want to kill myself"") and a desire to live (""I really want to give life a chance""). This fits the definition of ""Distress without actionable suicide intent"" and ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts.""

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no higher categories are met.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The explicit statement ""I don't want to kill myself"" is a clear rejection, which, according to the rule, downgrades any potential interpretation of suicidal desire.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Yes.

**Conclusion:** The post demonstrates significant emotional distress and hopelessness, but it explicitly disavows suicidal intent and expresses a desire to live and improve their life. This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' category.

153,Life just gets more and more overwhelming and difficult. How to deal with suicidal thoughts and ideations. I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family but I know I shouldn't I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out . Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""suicidal thoughts and ideations"", ""I want to die"", ""I want to kill myself"".
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""overwhelming and difficult"", ""in a rut"", ""too weak and pathetic"".
    *   Specific methods: None stated.
    *   Preparations: None stated.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself"" - Yes, active desire is expressed.
    *   Passive experience: ""How to deal with suicidal thoughts and ideations"" - This part is passive, seeking help for intrusive thoughts.
    *   Rejection noted? Yes, explicitly: ""but I know I shouldn't"" and ""I just am too weak and pathetic to do it."" These are clear disavowals or stated inability to act on the desire.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: ""I want to die tomorrow"" - This is a specific, near-future timeline.
    *   Future ideation: Not applicable.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""I want to die"", ""I want to kill myself"").
        *   Immediate timeline: Yes (""tomorrow"").
        *   *Initial thought*: This would push it towards **Behavior** due to the immediate timeline.

    *   **Applying IRREDUCIBLE RULES and Category Definitions:**
        *   **Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps)**: ""tomorrow"" is an imminent timeline.
        *   **Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade)**: ""I know I shouldn't"" and ""I just am too weak and pathetic to do it."" This rule states that ""I don't actually want to"" (or similar rejection) downgrades to **Indicator**.
        *   **Category Definition for Indicator**: ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"" is a key clarification. The post contains an active desire (""I want to die tomorrow"") but immediately follows it with a rejection (""but I know I shouldn't"") and a stated inability to act (""I just am too weak and pathetic to do it""). This perfectly matches the ""rejected thoughts"" criterion for Indicator.

    *   **Conclusion**: While there's an immediate timeline and explicit desire, the explicit rejection and stated inability to act on that desire, as per Rule 4 and the Indicator definition, overrides the immediacy. The post describes distress and a struggle with suicidal thoughts that are ultimately being rejected or inhibited by the writer, rather than actionable intent.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""yeet myself"" (modern slang implying self-harm or suicide, a desire to end existence).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""dead inside"" (metaphorical). ""useless life,"" ""beyond saving"" (hopelessness, worthlessness).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""useless life,"" ""depressive episode,"" ""dead inside,"" ""still sad,"" ""still anhedonic,"" ""beyond saving,"" ""want to cry."" (Strong indicators of despair, anhedonia, hopelessness, worthlessness).
    *   **Specific methods:** ""yeet myself"" is a general desire for self-harm/suicide, but not a *specific* actionable method like ""pills"" or ""hanging.""
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** ""after having a huge depressive episode"" (describes a past mental state, not a past suicide attempt).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much."" The ""I just want to"" indicates active desire and ownership of the thought. ""way too much"" indicates intensity.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal or rejection of the thought.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""after having a huge depressive episode"" (describes a past state of mind).
    *   **Present intent:** ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"" (current desire).
    *   **Future ideation:** ""I know they won't last"" (future prediction about good days, not suicide).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. (Rule: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" is absent).
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""I just want to... yeet myself.""
        *   Specific method: ""yeet myself"" is not a *specific* actionable method (like ""take pills,"" ""jump off a bridge""). It's more of a general desire for self-destruction.
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No mention of ""tonight,"" ""right now,"" or ""this weekend."" ""way too much"" indicates intensity, not immediacy.
        *   Therefore, this does *not* qualify for BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, ""I just want to... yeet myself"" clearly conveys a wish to end existence.
        *   Non-actionable methods: ""yeet myself"" fits this description as it's not a specific, actionable plan.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Confirmed.
        *   This fits the criteria for **IDEATION**.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is an active expression of suicidal desire (""I just want to... yeet myself""), not *only* distress or rejected thoughts.

**Category Definitions & Rules Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'..."" (implied by ""yeet myself""). ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"" (fits ""yeet myself""). ""No preparation or immediate timeline."" All criteria met.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempt is described.

**Irreducible Rules:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior, so Ideation is the highest applicable.
3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output one.

The phrase ""yeet myself"" in this context, combined with the intense despair and hopelessness, clearly indicates active suicidal desire. However, its lack of specificity as a method and the absence of an immediate timeline or preparation prevent it from being classified as 'Behavior'.

    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → **YES**, ""I tried to end it once before.""

    *   According to the decision tree and the ""Attempt"" definition, this immediately classifies the post as **ATTEMPT**. The rule ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned"" confirms this. Even though there's a present wish (""Sometimes I wish I succeeded""), the concrete past attempt takes precedence.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, all statements are about the writer.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. The presence of a past attempt (""I tried to end it once before"") means the category is 'attempt'.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""why keep going?"" is an active questioning of continuing life, implying a desire to stop. ""give up and just get it over with"" also suggests an active desire to end the current state.
    *   Passive experience: ""my brain is screaming at me"" initially suggests an intrusive thought.
    *   Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal. The ""my brain is screaming"" part is immediately followed by a rationalization for ending life (""I'll never be out of this torture cycle, so why keep going?""), which shifts it from a purely rejected thought to an active consideration and desire.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""Every time I am back here"" (recurring pattern of distress).
    *   Present intent: ""Now my brain is screaming"", ""why keep going?"" (current state and active questioning).

    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts →
        *   While ""my brain is screaming at me"" has an intrusive quality, the subsequent ""why keep going?"" is an active question about the value of continuing to live, which goes beyond *only* distress or rejected thoughts. It expresses a desire to end the ""torture cycle"" by ceasing to exist.
        *   *The ""why keep going?"" elevates it beyond INDICATOR.*

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear desire to end the ""torture cycle"" and questions the purpose of continuing to live (""why keep going?"").

    Based on the strict definition of **Behavior** (""Specific method stated"" OR ""Preparation evidence"" OR ""Imminent timeline""), this post does not meet the criteria for Behavior. While ""planning to commit suicide"" indicates a strong, active intent beyond a mere wish, it lacks the actionable components (method, preparation, or immediacy) required by the Behavior definition.

    Therefore, it falls into **Ideation**.
    **Ideation** is defined as ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan"". The phrase ""planning to commit suicide"" represents a strong active suicidal desire. While ""planning"" suggests a step beyond just ""wanting,"" without the specifics of method, preparation, or immediate timeline, it is categorized as Ideation according to the provided framework's strict boundaries. The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation states it ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"", which is not present here.

    *   Not Indicator: There is clear, active suicidal desire, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.

    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.

    *   **Past actions:** The core of the post describes a past situation where the writer ""was so close to attempting suicide"" and chose an alternative (""dumped everything on my mom in a text"") *instead* of ""going through with attempting suicide."" This strongly points to a past, near-attempt or aborted attempt.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The past situation clearly involved active suicidal intent (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"").
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The writer *did not* go through with the attempt, but this was due to taking an alternative action (texting mom), not a rejection of the suicidal desire itself in that moment.

        *   The post states: ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide."" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide"".
        *   The definition of **Attempt** explicitly includes ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped')"".
        *   While no physical action was initiated *and then stopped* (like putting a belt around the neck), the phrasing ""was so close to attempting suicide"" and ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" describes a state of being on the very verge of an attempt, where the decision to act was imminent, but an alternative action (reaching out to mom) was taken *instead*, effectively aborting the attempt. This aligns with the spirit of an aborted attempt, where the intent and proximity to action were high, but the attempt was prevented.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        *   **Writer-focused:** Yes.
        *   **Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation:** The post describes a past near-attempt, which takes precedence.
        *   **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable, as the intent is past.
        *   **Rejection downgrade:** The action taken (texting mom) was a *diversion* from the attempt, not a rejection of the suicidal thought itself in that moment. The intent was present and acted upon by choosing an alternative.

    *   Given the strong language indicating proximity to an attempt (""so close,"" ""going through with""), and the fact that an alternative action was taken *instead* of the attempt, this fits the ""aborted attempt"" aspect of the **Attempt** category.

    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""I cant take it"", ""pain makes me want to scream"", ""Its excruciating"" - indicate severe distress, pain, and overwhelming feelings.
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: No. The phrase ""I wont kill myself of course"" is a clear disavowal.
    *   Passive experience: The pain *makes* them want to scream, which is a reaction to distress, not an endorsement of suicide. The suicidal thought itself is rejected.
    *   Rejection noted? Yes, explicitly: ""I wont kill myself of course"".

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: No (due to rejection).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator**: Fits perfectly. ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" is present (""I cant take it"", ""pain"", ""excruciating""). Crucially, it includes ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"" which directly maps to ""I wont kill myself of course but the pain makes me want to scream"". There are ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" because the desire is explicitly negated.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**

    *   Explicit suicide references: None.

The post expresses significant distress and unhappiness, specifically related to gender dysphoria and societal pressures, but contains no explicit or implicit suicidal desire, intent, or action. It fits the definition of ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" without any actionable suicide intent.

**Category Definition Check:**

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" (This is an explicit desire for self-termination, though framed as a wish for courage to do so).
    *   **Indirect death references:** None beyond ""end it all.""
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""hate myself,"" ""loathe my existence,"" ""bad one"" (day), ""deep down I know this actually is probably true"" (referring to ""things get better""). These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None related to suicide attempts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I hate myself,"" ""I loathe my existence."" The phrase ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" initially suggests active desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** This is the most crucial part for this post. Immediately after ""wish I had the courage to end it all,"" the writer states: ""And yet. I just want the courage to endure it all."" Later, ""And yet, here I stay. waiting. Because deep down I know this actually is probably true [things get better]."" The writer then shifts to offering support and hope to others (""you aren't alone,"" ""you are loved, you are seen,"" ""Stay around to see these days, the good, the bad. There's more to come""). This clearly indicates a strong *rejection* of the suicidal thought and an active choice to *endure* and *stay*.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""Today was another day. A bad one."" (General distress, not suicide-specific past action).
    *   **Present intent:** No present intent to act. The present focus is on enduring and offering support.
    *   **Future ideation:** The initial ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" is future-oriented, but immediately countered by a desire to endure. The rest of the post focuses on the future in a hopeful, enduring context (""Stay around to see these days,"" ""There's more to come"").

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. While there's an initial explicit desire, it lacks method/preparation/immediacy, and critically, it is immediately rejected.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → This might seem to fit ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" in isolation. However, the ""Irreducible Rule: Rejection downgrade"" is paramount here. The explicit desire is directly followed by a desire to *endure* and an active choice to *stay*.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This is the best fit. The post contains significant distress (""hate myself,"" ""loathe my existence""). The initial thought of ""ending it all"" is immediately followed by a clear statement of wanting ""the courage to endure it all"" and actively choosing to ""stay."" This perfectly matches the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" clarification under the **Indicator** category, as the suicidal thought is presented and then explicitly disavowed or countered by a desire to live/endure.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** *Crucial for this post*. The initial ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" is explicitly rejected by ""I just want the courage to endure it all"" and ""here I stay. waiting."" This strong rejection downgrades what might otherwise be Ideation to Indicator.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will ensure this.

**Final Decision:** The post expresses profound distress and an initial fleeting wish for self-termination, but it is immediately and strongly counteracted by a desire to endure, an active choice to stay, and a focus on offering hope and support to others. This aligns with the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" aspect of the Indicator category.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

This falls under the ""Attempt"" definition: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent. Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped')."" The phrase ""almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" signifies an aborted attempt due to lack of means, not lack of intent.

    **IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
    1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all statements are about the user.

    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: Not explicitly stated, but the call for a joint act implies severe distress and a desire to die.
    *   Specific methods: None mentioned.
    *   Preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Past actions: None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes. The phrases ""suicide with me"" and ""can anyone suicide with me together"" clearly indicate an active desire and intent to commit suicide, and an active solicitation for others to join. This is not passive, intrusive, or rejected.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: The phrasing ""suicide with me"" and ""can anyone suicide with me together"" implies a current, active desire and readiness to act as soon as a partner is found. It's a call to action in the present.
    *   Future ideation: Not a non-specific future thought; it's a present proposition.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: YES (""suicide with me"", ""want to suicide too"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No specific method or preparation is mentioned.
        *   Immediate timeline: No explicit ""tonight"" or ""now"" is stated.
        *   However, consider the ""Critical expansion"" for **Behavior**: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" While not explicitly ""tonight,"" the *active solicitation* for a joint suicide (""can anyone suicide with me together"") represents a very strong and immediate intent to act, contingent only on finding a partner. This goes beyond mere ideation (a wish to die) because it's an active step towards facilitating the act. The individual is not just thinking about it; they are actively seeking to enable the behavior. This is a direct call to action for a suicidal act.

    *   Comparing with Ideation: Ideation is ""Explicit wish to die... No preparation or immediate timeline."" This post is more than just a wish; it's an active attempt to *organize* and *execute* the act with others. The active solicitation for a partner pushes it beyond passive ideation into the realm of active intent to behave.

    Therefore, this falls under **Behavior** due to the strong, active, and immediate intent to engage in a suicidal act, expressed through a direct call to action and solicitation for a partner, even without specific method or exact timing. The readiness to act is clear.

    *   **Rejection noted?** ""It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it."" YES, there is a clear rejection of *current* intent to follow through with the final act. ""maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge"" also implies a desire for intervention.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This describes a past action taken with suicidal intent.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I don't think I'm going to do it."" (Present *lack* of intent to complete the act).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?**
        *   The post states: ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things.""
        *   The ""Attempt"" definition includes: ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped')"".
        *   Driving to a specific location *with full intentions to end things* and then *stopping* (deciding ""I don't think I'm going to do it"") perfectly fits the description of an ""interrupted/aborted attempt."" It's a concrete action taken with suicidal intent that was not completed.
        *   The ""Irreducible Rules"" state: ""Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation"" and ""Attempt overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned."" The presence of an aborted attempt takes precedence over the current lack of intent.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post explicitly describes taking a concrete action (""driving up to the mountains"") with clear suicidal intent (""with full intentions to end things""). Although the individual decided not to complete the act (""I don't think I'm going to do it""), this constitutes an ""interrupted/aborted attempt"" as per the definition provided in the framework. The framework's ""Attempt"" category specifically includes such scenarios and takes precedence over other categories when present.

    *   **Emotional markers:** ""nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life"" (hopelessness), ""Fuck this world"" (despair, anger).
    *   **Specific methods:** None explicitly stated.
    *   **Preparations:** ""The date was set a while ago"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go."" This clearly indicates active preparation and a state of readiness for an imminent act.
    *   **Past actions:** None described.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""I'm ready to die"", ""I'm ready"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go."" The writer claims full ownership and active intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No disavowal or rejection of the thoughts/plans.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""The date was set a while ago"", ""I even changed it"" refers to the *setting* of a plan, not a past attempt.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm ready to die"", ""I'm ready"", ""Preps being made"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go."" This strongly indicates current readiness and an imminent timeline (""strapped in and ready to go"" implies immediate action).
    *   **Future ideation:** No, this is beyond non-specific future thoughts.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

        *   **Preparation:** Yes, explicitly (""The date was set"", ""Preps being made"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"").
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes, ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" strongly implies immediate readiness and an imminent timeline, even without specific time markers like ""tonight.""
    *   This combination of explicit intent, clear preparation, and implied immediacy directly matches the criteria for **Behavior**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to active suicidal desire, preparation, and implied immediacy.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is clear preparation and implied immediacy beyond just a wish to die.
*   **Behavior:** Matches perfectly. ""Preparation evidence"" is present (""Preps being made"", ""strapped in and ready to go""). ""Imminent timeline"" is strongly implied by ""I'm strapped in and ready to go."" The ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent... qualify even without method details"" applies here.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""last post on here"" (implying end of life/presence), ""pls let me never wake up"" (direct wish for death/non-existence).
*   **Indirect death references:** ""its working!"" (implies an ongoing process leading to the desired outcome of not waking up).
*   **Emotional markers:** Not explicitly stated, but the desire for death implies unbearable pain/hopelessness.
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None explicitly stated, but ""its working!"" could imply preparation is underway or completed.
*   **Past actions:** None.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""its working!"", ""hopefully this is my last post"", ""pls let me never wake up"" are all active desires and statements of current progress towards an intended outcome by the writer.
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted?** No rejection.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** No.
*   **Present intent:** ""its working!"" indicates an ongoing process *now*. ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up"" refer to an immediate or very near-future desired outcome. This is not a distant future ideation.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""last post on here"" and ""never wake up"" clearly express a desire to die.
    *   **Specific method/preparation:** No specific method or preparation is detailed.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes. The phrase ""its working!"" strongly implies an ongoing process that is leading to an *imminent* outcome. This, combined with ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up,"" conveys a sense of immediate intent and an active movement towards ending their life. This aligns with the ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" While ""tonight"" isn't used, ""its working!"" and ""last post on here"" convey a strong sense of immediacy.

This goes beyond mere Ideation (which lacks an immediate timeline or actionable plan). The ""its working!"" elevates it to a state of active pursuit of an immediate end.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all statements are from the writer.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as there's no attempt.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Yes, ""its working!"" combined with the desire for an immediate end (""never wake up,"" ""last post"") indicates immediacy, pushing it past Ideation.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection present.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output one category.

Based on the strong indication of an ongoing process (""its working!"") leading to an immediate desired outcome of death (""never wake up,"" ""last post""), this fits the criteria for **Behavior**.

        *   All conditions for 'Behavior' are met. The post expresses immediate intent, possesses specific means, and describes preparation (having the pills).

    *   This clearly falls under **Behavior**. It's beyond mere ideation due to the specific means, preparation, and imminent timeline. It's not an attempt because no past action is described. It's not an indicator because there's active, specific intent.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES:**

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The phrase ""More and more often it feels like the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself"" indicates an active consideration and growing acceptance of suicide as a solution.

    *   Rejection noted?: No explicit disavowal (""but I won't do it""). The last sentence ""I guess it does feel good to at least get all of this off my chest"" indicates some relief from expressing, but does not negate the suicidal thought.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No past attempts or actions.
    *   Present intent: No immediate timeline (""doing it tonight"", ""right now""). The ""More and more often it feels like..."" suggests an increasing, but not immediate, consideration.
    *   Future ideation: The statement ""the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself"" points to suicide as a future perceived solution, but without a specific timeframe.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""check out"" (repeatedly used as a euphemism for dying/suicide), ""suicide"" (explicitly stated ""no moral problem with suicide""). ""Go out this way"" also refers to dying.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""running on nothing but shear spite"", ""spite has its limits"" (suggests dwindling reasons to live).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I really want to check out"", ""I have no moral problem with suicide"". The writer clearly owns and expresses a strong desire to end their life.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not passive.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The post states, ""it just seems like such a waste to go out this way when I have held on for so long but I have come to realize recently that even spite has its limits."" This is a *reason for not acting yet*, not a *rejection* of the suicidal desire itself. The final clause (""even spite has its limits"") suggests this reason is weakening, intensifying the underlying desire. This does *not* trigger Rule 4 (""Rejection downgrade: 'I don't actually want to' → indicator"").

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I really want to check out *at this point*"", ""spite has its limits"" (implies a current, active struggle where the desire is present and growing stronger).
    *   **Future ideation:** Not explicitly future-focused, but rather a present state of strong desire.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""I really want to check out"", ""no moral problem with suicide"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (""tonight"", ""right now"" are absent). ""Spite has its limits"" indicates a nearing threshold, but not an *immediate* plan.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes.
        *   Explicit wish to die: ""I really want to check out"", ""don't deserve to live"" (implied by ""running on nothing but shear spite"" and desire to ""check out"").
        *   Non-actionable methods: Not specified, but the desire is clear without a concrete plan.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Confirmed.
        *   *Key boundary*: It does not become BEHAVIOR because there's no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because there is clear, active, and owned suicidal desire (""I really want to check out""). The thoughts are not rejected.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post contains explicit expressions of active suicidal desire (""I really want to check out"", ""no moral problem with suicide"") and intense hopelessness. While there's a stated reason for *not yet* acting (""such a waste to go out this way""), this is explicitly stated as weakening (""even spite has its limits""), and it is *not* a rejection of the desire itself. There is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline mentioned. This perfectly aligns with the definition of **Ideation**.

""Im going to do it"" is a direct expression of immediate intent. The farewell message (""thank you to the people I met thru this sub. and I hope everyone finds something to live for."") further supports the interpretation of immediate intent and finality, akin to a preparation like writing a note.

    *   Therefore, the post fits the criteria for **Behavior**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator**: No, because there is explicit, active suicidal desire and intent (""im going to do it"").
*   **Ideation**: No, because it goes beyond just a wish to die. There is a clear statement of intent to act (""im going to do it"") and an implied immediate timeline/finality.

    *   Emotional markers: ""stupid"" (self-judgment), ""lot of stress"" (distress), ""never really seen myself going anywhere in life"" (hopelessness, worthlessness).
    *   Specific methods: Asks for ""a mostly painless way"" – seeking a method, not stating one.
    *   Preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Past actions: None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes. The question ""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"" indicates active consideration and seeking information for *their own* action. The justifications (""lot of stress,"" ""never seen myself going anywhere"") support this active desire.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No explicit disavowal. ""I know that's it's stupid"" is a self-judgment, not a rejection of the suicidal intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: The question is posed in the present, indicating a current desire to find a way. ""I've got a lot of stress right now"" refers to present circumstances.
    *   Future ideation: The act itself would be in the future, but the desire and seeking of a method are present. No specific future timeline like ""tonight"" or ""this weekend.""

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
        *   No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → BEHAVIOR**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""kill myself"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No specific method *chosen/possessed* by the user, only asking for one. No preparation mentioned.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (""tonight"", ""right now"").
        *   Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → IDEATION**
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, clearly (""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes. The user is *seeking* a plan/method, not stating one they have or are about to execute. No immediate timeline.
        *   This aligns with the IDEATION definition: ""Explicit wish to die"" and ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"" and ""No preparation or immediate timeline.""
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → INDICATOR**
        *   No, there is clear active suicidal desire, not just distress or rejected thoughts.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of the suicidal thought itself.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Yes.

**Final Classification:** The post expresses a clear, active desire to die and seeks a method, but without a specific plan, means, or immediate timeline. This perfectly matches the definition of Ideation.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""commit suicide"", ""Overdosing"", ""end it with pills"", ""suicide"" (in ""Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide"").
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""peaceful way to die"", ""Life over"", ""your liver will slowly die"", ""that's it"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** The post describes physical pain and suffering associated with overdose, but these are presented as factual consequences, not the writer's personal emotional state.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""pills"", ""overdosing"".
    *   **Preparations:** None by the writer.
    *   **Past actions:** None by the writer.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** No. The writer is *not* expressing a desire to commit suicide or endorse it. The post is a detailed warning *against* overdosing.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** Yes, strongly. The repeated phrase ""Don't take the pills"" at the beginning and end, combined with the detailed description of the horrific physical consequences of an overdose, clearly indicates a rejection of the idea of suicide by overdose. The post's purpose is to *dissuade* rather than express intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   The post describes hypothetical *future* consequences (""you'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting..."") if someone were to overdose. It does not describe past or present intent of the writer.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **Start here →**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No. The writer does not express *personal* suicide intent.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No. The writer does not express a desire to die.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. While the post is highly descriptive of a suicide method, the writer's *intent* is to debunk a myth and deter. The core message ""Don't take the pills"" functions as a strong rejection of the action. The post is *about* suicide, but it is not an *expression* of suicidal ideation or intent from the writer. It falls under the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" clarification for ""Indicator"" because the writer is actively arguing *against* the suicidal action.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, analysis is on the writer's intent, which is to warn/dissuade, not to express personal suicidal thoughts.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no higher categories are met.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** This rule is critical here. The post's explicit and implicit rejection of overdosing as a viable or peaceful option places it in the lowest risk category.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post discusses suicide methods in graphic detail, but its overarching purpose, as indicated by phrases like ""Don't take the pills"" and the detailed negative consequences, is to *deter* someone from attempting suicide via overdose. The writer is not expressing personal suicidal intent or distress, but rather providing information to counter a misconception and prevent harm. This aligns with the ""rejected thoughts"" aspect of the 'Indicator' category, as the writer is actively rejecting the idea of suicide by overdose.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""im positive im gonna do it"", ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this"". These are clear statements of suicidal intent.
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""fed up of this"" indicate hopelessness and despair.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None described by the writer.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, the writer states ""im positive im gonna do it"" and ""ill do it"". This is active endorsement of the suicidal intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""im not ready"", ""dont worry, im good rn"". This is a rejection of *current* action/immediacy, but *not* a rejection of the underlying suicidal desire or future intent. The writer explicitly states ""im positive im gonna do it the the future"". Therefore, the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule does not apply as the core desire is affirmed, not disavowed.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** Explicitly denied (""im good rn"", ""im not ready"").
    *   **Future ideation:** ""im positive im gonna do it the the future"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this"". This indicates a future, non-specific timeline for suicidal action.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""im positive im gonna do it"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (""in the future"", ""im good rn"").
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""im positive im gonna do it"", ""no motivation to keep on living"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes (no method, no immediate timeline, explicitly deferred to ""the future"").
        *   This aligns perfectly with IDEATION.

**Category Definitions with Key Clarifications Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"". Yes, ""im positive im gonna do it"". ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". Yes, ""in the future"", ""im good rn"". This fits.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of past action.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt or behavior is present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Immediacy is explicitly denied (""im good rn""), so it doesn't apply to upgrade the category.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The statement ""im not ready"" or ""im good rn"" is a deferral of *action*, not a rejection of the *desire* to die. The explicit statement ""im positive im gonna do it the the future"" confirms the active suicidal desire, preventing a downgrade to Indicator.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None. The post expresses extreme negative feelings about being alive (""psychologically tortured"") but not a direct desire to end life through suicide.
    *   **Indirect death references:** None. ""Psychologically tortured"" describes a state of suffering, not a wish for death or non-existence.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""I fucking hate"", ""psychologically tortured"" - indicates significant distress, anger, and pain.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None related to suicide.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** No active endorsement of suicidal thoughts or desire to die. The focus is on the pain of *living* and the perceived fault of the parents for that existence.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted?** Not applicable.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes the parents' past actions (""having me"") and the resulting current state of suffering (""living a life psychologically tortured"").
    *   **Present intent:** No present intent related to suicide.
    *   **Future ideation:** No future ideation related to suicide.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No. There is no explicit suicide intent.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No. The post does not express a wish to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). It expresses suffering from being alive.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post clearly indicates significant distress, unhappiness, and despair (""I fucking hate my parents"", ""psychologically tortured""). It does not contain any actionable suicide intent, explicit desire to die, or specific plans/methods. It fits the definition of ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" under the Indicator category.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes, the post is about the writer's personal experience and feelings.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no suicide-related content.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable.
*   **Output exactly one:** Will output one category.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses intense emotional pain and distress related to existence and parental actions, but it lacks any direct or indirect suicidal ideation, intent, or action. It describes the suffering of being alive rather than a desire to end life. This aligns with the ""Indicator"" category.

I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake.

    *   **Past actions (self-harm):** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** No active endorsement of suicidal thoughts or actions. The post is about a terrifying dream and its emotional aftermath.
    *   **Passive experience:** The user describes experiencing a dream and the resulting panic/anxiety. This is about an external (dream) event causing internal distress, not internal suicidal ideation.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are present to be rejected.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

There are no expressions of active suicidal desire, plans, or past attempts. The references to death are entirely within the context of the dream's narrative, not the user's self-harm intent.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**

    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **Past actions:** ""Everytime I try I fail."" This is vague. It could refer to trying to cope, trying to succeed in life, or even trying to attempt suicide. However, for an 'Attempt' classification, the framework requires ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" or ""tried to"" or ""attempted."" ""Everytime I try I fail"" does not meet this specificity for a past suicide attempt. It's more indicative of general life struggles and a sense of failure.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""now I want to die more than ever"" is a direct and active statement of suicidal desire. ""I can't have this life it's too painful"" also indicates a desire to escape current existence.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal or rejection of the suicidal thoughts.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""I told my mom..."", ""I thought it was becoming better..."", ""I'll never come back..."". These describe past events leading to the current state. ""Everytime I try I fail"" is a general past experience.
    *   **Present intent:** ""now I want to die more than ever."" This expresses a current, active desire. ""I can't have this life it's too painful"" describes the current unbearable situation.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future plans mentioned (e.g., ""someday I will""). The desire is very much in the present.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. ""Everytime I try I fail"" is too vague and does not describe a concrete past self-harm action with suicidal intent.

        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""now I want to die more than ever.""
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No. The ""now"" refers to the *intensity* and *current presence* of the desire, not an *imminent action* (e.g., ""doing it tonight"").
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, ""now I want to die more than ever.""

**Category Definitions Check:**

The ""now"" refers to the *current intensity* of the desire, not an *imminent action*, which is a key boundary for Ideation vs. Behavior.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no concrete past attempt is described.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, analysis is solely on the user's post.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicide by hanging""
    *   **Indirect death references:** N/A
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""still not sure"", ""don't want lied to"", ""please be honest"" (suggests seeking critical information for a decision, distress, ambivalence about the *method's experience* but not necessarily the *act* itself)
    *   **Specific methods:** ""hanging""
    *   **Preparations:** ""ive alr tied the noose"" (direct evidence of preparation)
    *   **Past actions:** N/A

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The user has already taken a concrete step (""tied the noose"") and is seeking information about the *experience* of the method, indicating active consideration and ownership of the suicidal thoughts/plans.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** ""im still not sure"" indicates ambivalence, but it's about the *pain/duration* of the method, not a rejection of the suicidal intent itself. It does not disavow the desire to die.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""ive alr tied the noose"" (a recent past action leading to the current state).
    *   **Present intent:** The question itself (""Is suicide by hanging..."") and the ""still not sure"" indicate a present deliberation with a prepared means. This is not future ideation; it's an immediate, active consideration.
    *   **Future ideation:** N/A

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → Yes.

        *   **Specific method:** ""hanging""
        *   **Preparation:** ""tied the noose""
        *   **Immediate timeline:** While not explicitly ""tonight,"" the active preparation (""tied the noose"") and the nature of the question (seeking final information about the *experience* of the act) strongly imply an imminent consideration. This combination of intent, specific method, and preparation clearly fits the ""Behavior"" criteria.

    *   **Category Definitions Check:**
        *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicide context, specific method, and preparation.
        *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is not just a wish to die, but a specific method *and* preparation.
        *   **Behavior:** Fits perfectly. ""Specific method stated: hanging."" ""Preparation evidence: tied the noose."" The level of preparedness and the nature of the information sought indicate capability and imminent intent.
        *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it's not a description of a past completed or interrupted act.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        *   1. Writer-focused: Yes.
        *   2. Temporal hierarchy: N/A (no attempt).
        *   3. Immediacy trumps: The active preparation (""tied the noose"") and the direct question about the method's experience signify a high level of immediacy and capability, pushing it past mere ideation.
        *   4. Rejection downgrade: ""im still not sure"" is about the *experience* of the method, not a rejection of the suicidal intent itself. It does not downgrade the classification.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""brink of suicide"" (used generally, referring to *others* or a past state of being close to it, not current active intent). The writer states ""felt like I couldn't cope"" which is general distress.
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""felt like I couldn't cope"" (past tense, expressing distress). ""predicaments that preceded it"" (past difficulties).
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: ""On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant."" (This is described as a coping mechanism, an *alternative* to suicide, not an attempt). ""the road has saved me in the past"" (saved from distress, not from an actual suicide attempt).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: No active endorsement of suicidal thoughts. The post is about finding an *alternative* to suicide for oneself and others.
    *   Passive experience: Not applicable.
    *   Rejection noted? Yes, the entire post is about finding a way *out* of feeling like one ""couldn't cope"" or being ""on the brink of suicide."" The ""road"" is presented as a solution that ""saved"" the writer.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""felt like I couldn't cope"", ""hit the road"", ""the road has saved me in the past"".
    *   Present intent: ""I am a functional member of society at the moment"". No present suicidal intent.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No. The ""road"" was a coping mechanism *instead* of suicide, explicitly stated as ""better than the predicaments that preceded it"" and something that ""saved me.""
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? No. The post is about *avoiding* suicide.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? No. The writer is currently functional and discussing past coping strategies, not current desire to die.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? Yes. The post acknowledges past ""brink of suicide"" feelings (distress) but explicitly presents an *alternative* and a coping strategy that ""saved"" the writer. There is no active suicidal desire or intent. The ""brink of suicide"" is a past state or a state for others, not a current active suicidal thought.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, the analysis focuses on the writer's state and intent. The ""brink of suicide"" is contextualized as a past feeling or a general state for others, not a current personal intent.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt/behavior/ideation is present.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The post actively promotes an *alternative* to suicide, implicitly rejecting it as a solution for the writer.
5.  Output exactly one: Will do.

    *   The presence of explicit suicide intent (""end it"") combined with an immediate timeline (""tonight"") directly matches the criteria for **Behavior**. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details.""

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.

        *   Immediate timeline: While not explicitly ""tonight,"" the question about the efficacy of *currently possessed* means implies an imminent consideration of action. This moves beyond mere ideation.

    **Category Definitions Check:**
    *   **Indicator:** No, there is clear active suicidal desire and specific means/preparation.
    *   **Ideation:** No, because there is not only explicit desire but also specific method and evidence of preparation (""I have 800mg codeine""). The question implies readiness to act if the means are sufficient.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits well. There is explicit intent (""end my life""), a specific method (codeine/ibuprofen), and evidence of preparation/possession of means (""I have 800mg codeine""). The question ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" is a direct inquiry into the capability of executing a plan, which aligns with the ""Intent + Capability"" aspect of Behavior.

    **Irreducible Rules Check:**
    1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
    2.  Temporal hierarchy: N/A (no attempt).
    3.  Immediacy trumps: The implied immediacy of the question with possessed means supports Behavior.
    4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection.

These are strong expressions of a desire for life to cease and an inability to continue.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""not wake up"", ""be gone"", ""painless way to die"" - None explicitly, but the phrases above strongly imply a desire for cessation of life.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""failed everything"", ""wasted it"", ""not happy or enjoying anythnig"", ""suffer everyday"", ""never been happy since birth"". High levels of hopelessness, worthlessness, and unbearable pain.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I fucking cant do this anymore"", ""i cant live like this"", ""i cant stand being here any other moment"". These are direct, active statements of the writer's current state and desire to cease.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""resisting the desire to end"" - This describes a past/ongoing struggle, but the subsequent statements indicate the resistance is failing, leading to active endorsement.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal. The ""resisting"" part is presented as a struggle that is now being lost, rather than a current rejection of suicidal thoughts.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""failed everything"", ""wasted it"", ""spent my whole life resisting"". These describe historical context for the current despair.
    *   **Present intent:** ""why should i live"", ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"", ""i fucking cant do this anymore"", ""i cant stand being here any other moment"". These are strong, present-tense statements of an immediate inability to continue living as is. ""I can't stand being here any other moment"" is particularly critical as it conveys an immediate crisis.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""i cant imagine myslef living another year thisway"". This indicates a lack of future outlook.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, clearly present (""why should i live"", ""desire to end"", ""can't do this anymore"").
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** No.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""i cant stand being here any other moment"" is a very strong expression of immediate distress and an inability to continue *in the present moment*. While not explicitly ""I will do it tonight,"" it conveys an imminent crisis where the current state is intolerable and must cease *now*. This aligns with the ""imminent timeline"" aspect of the Behavior category, especially considering the ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent... qualify even without method details."" The user is expressing an immediate intent to *not continue* enduring their current suffering. This is more than just a wish to die (Ideation); it's an active statement of being unable to tolerate continued existence *at this very moment*.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** This post goes beyond simple desire due to the strong immediacy implied by ""i cant stand being here any other moment"".
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear active suicidal desire and implied immediacy.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No attempt. The immediacy pushes it to Behavior over Ideation.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** ""i cant stand being here any other moment"" is a strong indicator of immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection. The ""resisting"" is presented as a past/failing effort.

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal desire and a strong expression of immediate inability to continue enduring the current state (""i cant stand being here any other moment""). This implied immediacy, even without a specific method, elevates it from Ideation to Behavior.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""end myself"" (attributed to ""voices"")
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""losing grip"", ""stupid financial mistakes"", ""haunt me"", ""getting worse"", ""don't know who to turn to"", ""can't stop crying"", ""can't cope with his own mistakes"", ""Why won't god talk to me?"", ""cry out for him to show me a solution"" - Indicates significant distress, hopelessness, and overwhelming feelings.
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None related to suicide.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself."" - This presents the suicidal thought as intrusive and external, not actively endorsed by the writer.
    *   ""I wanna see my daughters grow up"" - This is a very strong explicit disavowal or counter-desire to the suicidal thought. It indicates a desire to live and a protective factor.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: Financial mistakes ""some years ago"", ""tried to keep my problems hidden"". No past suicidal actions.
    *   Present intent: The ""voices"" are ""telling me"" now, but the counter-desire (""I wanna see my daughters grow up"") is also present. No immediate plan.
    *   Future ideation: ""I wanna see my daughters grow up"" is a future-oriented desire to live.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No specific method, no preparation, no immediate timeline. Crucially, the intent is presented as intrusive and *rejected*.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → While ""end myself"" is mentioned, it's explicitly framed as an intrusive thought (""voices"") and immediately countered by a strong desire to live (""I wanna see my daughters grow up""). This does not represent *active* suicidal desire.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This fits. The post is full of distress, and the suicidal thought (""end myself"") is presented as an intrusive thought that the writer is actively fighting against (""I wanna see my daughters grow up""). This clearly aligns with the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" clarification for the Indicator category.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
*   Writer-focused: Yes.
*   Temporal hierarchy: N/A.
*   Immediacy trumps: N/A.
*   Rejection downgrade: The phrase ""I wanna see my daughters grow up"" acts as a direct rejection/counter-desire to the intrusive thought of ending himself, thereby downgrading it from potential ideation.
*   Output exactly one: Will do.

**Final Decision Rationale:** The post expresses profound distress and hopelessness due to financial issues. While the phrase ""end myself"" is present, it is explicitly attributed to ""voices"" (intrusive thought) and immediately followed by a strong counter-desire to live (""I wanna see my daughters grow up""). This combination of intrusive thoughts and explicit rejection of suicide places it firmly in the Indicator category, as per the definition: ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"" and ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire.""

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""maybe i don't need to die"" - This is a *rejection* or questioning of the need to die, not an endorsement.
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""not okay right now"" (distress), ""mental health stuff"" (acknowledgment of struggles), ""hopeful thought,"" ""hope i can have that one day,"" ""i can be okay"" (hope, resilience).
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None related to suicide.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: No. The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" signifies a *lack* of active endorsement and a reconsideration/rejection of suicidal thoughts.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? Yes, ""maybe i don't need to die"" is a direct questioning/rejection of the idea of dying.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No suicide-related past focus.
    *   Present intent: No present suicide intent.
    *   Future ideation: The post expresses hope for a better future (""i hope i can have that one day,"" ""i can be okay"").

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? No. There is no explicit suicide intent; rather, there is a rejection of it.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? No. The post explicitly *questions* the desire to die, moving away from it.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? Yes. The post shows distress (""not okay right now,"" ""mental health stuff"") but crucially includes a rejected thought (""maybe i don't need to die""). This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"" and ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire.""

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, the post is about the writer's feelings.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no higher categories are present.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" clearly indicates a rejection of suicidal ideation, pushing it towards 'Indicator'.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output one category.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses general distress and hope for the future, but the critical phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" indicates a rejection or reconsideration of suicidal thoughts. This fits the definition of 'Indicator'.

194,hi i dont wanna die rn i just came here bc i thought some of u would know something about this so. can you die from taking 3 xanax pills? i dont think thats possible i just wanna be calm rn because im bored and when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there. and dont tell me not to do this bc i will do it anyway i just wanna know what is the worst thing that can happen to me,0,indicator,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicidal thoughts are always there""
*   **Indirect death references:** ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"", ""what is the worst thing that can happen to me"" (implying death as a possibility)
*   **Emotional markers:** ""bored"", ""wanna be calm""
*   **Specific methods:** ""taking 3 xanax pills""
*   **Preparations:** Asking about the lethality of a specific dose of pills could be interpreted as research for an attempt.
*   **Past actions:** None.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The phrase ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" indicates ongoing ideation. The statement ""i will do it anyway"" refers to taking the pills, and this is immediately preceded by a question about *dying* from them. While the user states ""i dont wanna die rn,"" this is immediately contradicted by the inquiry about lethality and the intent to take the pills. The primary focus of the query is about the lethal outcome of taking the pills.
*   **Passive experience:** ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" could be seen as intrusive, but the subsequent intent to act on taking pills with a query about lethality shifts this.
*   **Rejection noted?** ""i dont wanna die rn"" is a rejection, but it's qualified by ""rn"" (right now) and strongly undermined by the subsequent content: asking about *dying* from a specific method (""3 xanax pills"") and stating ""i will do it anyway"" (referring to taking the pills). The ""Irreducible Rule: Rejection downgrade"" applies when the rejection is *absolute* and *overrides* any intent. Here, the rejection is partial (""rn"") and immediately contradicted by a stated intent to act on a specific method with a query about its lethal potential.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** None.
*   **Present intent:** ""i will do it anyway"" implies immediate or very near-future action. ""i just wanna be calm rn"" is a present desire. The question about dying from Xanax is a present inquiry related to a potential action.
*   **Future ideation:** ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" (general, ongoing).

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** The user explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and asks about dying from a specific substance they intend to take (""i will do it anyway""). While they state ""i dont wanna die rn"", the immediate follow-up about lethality and intent to act on the pills strongly suggests a suicidal intent is being explored or acted upon. The question is not just about getting calm, but about the *worst thing that can happen*, implying death.
    *   **Specific method:** ""3 xanax pills"" is a specific method.
    *   **Preparation:** Asking about the lethal dose of a specific substance they intend to take can be considered research for preparation.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** ""i will do it anyway"" implies an imminent action.

    This post contains a specific method (""3 xanax pills"") and an expression of intent to take them (""i will do it anyway"") within the context of suicidal thoughts and a direct query about the lethal outcome. The initial ""i dont wanna die rn"" is overridden by the strength of the subsequent statements of intent and inquiry into lethality. This fits the criteria for **Behavior**.

    *   **Why not Indicator?** Because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire/intent (""suicidal thoughts are always there"" combined with the query about dying from the pills and the intent to take them) and a specific method/imminent action. The rejection is not strong enough to downgrade given the rest of the content.
    *   **Why not Ideation?** Because there is a specific method (""3 xanax pills"") and an expression of intent to act (""i will do it anyway""), moving beyond just a wish to die.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kill myself"" (conditional: ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"")
    *   **Indirect death references:** None beyond the explicit.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""shitface i am"", ""fucking monster"", ""piece of human garbage"", ""I don't know what to do at this point"", ""hurt my friend"" - strong self-loathing, guilt, hopelessness, distress.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" - This is a direct query for a method of self-harm. While self-harm isn't always suicidal, in context with ""kill myself"", it's highly concerning and suggests a search for means. The framework lists ""cutting"" as a specific method for Behavior, and asking *where* to self-harm is a step towards that.
    *   **Preparations:** ""wait until I can kill myself"" implies a future conditional action, but no concrete preparation is described. However, the self-harm query is a form of seeking means/method.
    *   **Past actions:** None related to suicide or self-harm attempts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""i will wait until I can kill myself"" is an active statement of intent, albeit conditional. The self-harm query is also an active search for information to act.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" - This is a *present* and *immediate* query for information related to self-harm methods.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"" - This is a conditional future intent.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Rules: Attempt > Behavior)
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   The post contains ""Explicit suicide intent"" (""kill myself"").
        *   It also contains a *present* query for a ""specific method"" of self-harm (""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing""). The framework's definition for Behavior includes ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location."" Asking *where* to self-harm is a direct inquiry into a method, implying a step towards capability or action.
        *   While the ""kill myself"" part is conditional/future, the *self-harm query* is immediate and actionable (seeking information *now* for potential action). The ""Irreducible Rules"" state ""Immediacy trumps: 'tonight' beats non-specific ideation."" The self-harm query represents an immediate search for means/method.
        *   This combination of explicit suicide intent and an immediate search for a specific method (even if for self-harm initially, it's in a context that includes suicide) strongly aligns with the ""Behavior"" category, which signifies intent + capability/method. The self-harm query indicates a step towards capability.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** This would be the case if *only* ""i will wait until I can kill myself"" was present, but the self-harm query adds an element of immediacy and method-seeking.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear explicit intent and method-seeking.

    The presence of the immediate query for self-harm methods, alongside the explicit (though conditional) suicide intent, pushes this beyond mere Ideation. The user is actively seeking information to enable harm, which falls under the ""Capability"" aspect of the Behavior definition.

Final Classification Rationale: The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""kill myself"") and, critically, an immediate, present-tense query for specific methods of self-harm (""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing""). This search for a method aligns with the ""Behavior"" category's emphasis on ""Specific method stated"" and ""Intent + Capability,"" even if the self-harm isn't explicitly stated as suicidal, it's in a context where suicide is mentioned. The immediacy of the self-harm query elevates the risk.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""going to kill myself soon""
    *   Indirect death references: ""wish I wasn't even born""
    *   Emotional markers: ""feeling a really strong urge"", ""only people i have in my life dont care"", ""life is fucking stupid""
    *   Specific methods: None
    *   Preparations: None
    *   Past actions: None

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""I'm probably going to kill myself soon."" clearly indicates active ownership of the suicidal thought/intent.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: ""feeling a really strong urge to lately""
    *   Future ideation: ""Im probably going to kill myself soon."" - ""Soon"" indicates a future, but not necessarily immediate, timeline.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""going to kill myself soon"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: ""Soon"" is not as immediate as ""tonight"", ""right now"", or ""this weekend"" as specified for the Behavior category. It lacks the concrete immediacy required for Behavior.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → This matches. The post expresses an explicit desire to die (""going to kill myself soon"") and a strong urge, but lacks a specific method, preparation, or an *immediate* (e.g., ""tonight"") timeline.

    *   Comparing with Ideation definition: ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"". ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"". ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". This fits.
    *   Comparing with Behavior definition: ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"". ""Soon"" does not meet this threshold. ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"" - ""soon"" is not ""tonight"".

    Therefore, the post falls under Ideation.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""plummet to the ground"", ""corpse"" (as opposed to ""crippled"").
*   **Indirect death references:** N/A.
*   **Emotional markers:** ""so tempted"", ""guilt"", ""fear"".
*   **Specific methods:** ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" (jumping from a height). This is a specific method and location.
*   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""so tempted to just go..."" indicates an active consideration and desire.
*   **Passive experience:** Not presented as intrusive thoughts.
*   **Rejection noted?** ""if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear..."" This expresses hesitation and obstacles to acting, but *not* an explicit disavowal of the suicidal desire itself. The desire and specific method are still present. This is not a rejection of the thought, but a contemplation of barriers to the action.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** No.
*   **Present intent:** ""so tempted"" describes a current state of temptation/ideation. No immediate timeline (""tonight"", ""now"") is given.
*   **Future ideation:** No.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" clearly expresses suicidal desire.
    *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" is a specific method (jumping) and location.
    *   **Preparation:** No.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** No.

    The presence of explicit suicide intent *and* a specific method (""highest floor and plummet"") strongly points towards **Behavior**.

Let's cross-reference with definitions:
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there's active suicidal desire and a specific method, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the method (""highest floor and plummet"") is specific and actionable, not ""non-actionable"" like ""painless way (without specification)"".
*   **Behavior:** Fits the criteria ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"". The post describes a specific jumping location and action. While there's no immediate timeline or preparation, the specific method is a key criterion for Behavior. The hesitation (""if only..."") indicates internal conflict but does not negate the presence of the specific suicidal desire and method.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes a current temptation, not a past action.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** N/A (no attempt).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy mentioned.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The ""if only..."" phrasing is not an explicit rejection of the suicidal desire itself (""I don't actually want to""). It expresses barriers to acting on a present desire, which includes a specific method. Therefore, it does not downgrade to Indicator.

The specific method (""highest floor and plummet to the ground"") is the decisive factor pushing this from Ideation to Behavior, as per the definition of Behavior.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""If I wanted to die I would have already jumped"" (reflection on own intent), ""someone took their life the same way"" (context of method).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage"", ""get the nerve to jump"", ""hoping I'll gain the courage"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""How does no one notice"", ""can't help it"", ""hoping... someone will show me they care"" (indicates distress, feeling unseen, desire for intervention).
    *   **Specific methods:** ""jump"" from ""the ledge of a hospital parking garage"".
    *   **Preparations:** ""standing on the ledge"", ""sit there"", ""Sometimes for an hour"", ""Trying to work up the nerve"". This describes a repeated, concrete action taken towards the method.
    *   **Past actions:** ""The last time, someone came out... looked at me and kept walking"" (describes a past instance of *their* action of being on the ledge). ""6 years ago someone took their life"" (someone else's past action, but provides context for the location).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer explicitly states they go to the ledge ""Trying to work up the nerve"" and ""hoping I'll gain the courage"" to jump. This is active engagement with the idea and the means.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not passive. The actions are deliberate.
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true."" This is a reflection on their current inability to act due to lack of nerve, not a rejection of the underlying desire or the act itself. They still ""go hoping I'll gain the courage.""

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes past instances of being on the ledge (""The last time..."").
    *   **Present intent:** The description of ""I can never get the nerve... But I'll stand there. Or sit there. Sometimes for an hour.

        *   **Immediate timeline:** While no explicit ""tonight"" or ""now,"" the *repeated and sustained nature* of being on the ledge for extended periods, ""trying to work up the nerve,"" implies an ongoing, active, and potentially imminent state of risk. The *action* of being at the location and trying to take the final step is a strong indicator of behavioral risk, even if the final step hasn't been taken.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** This would be Ideation. However, the post goes beyond mere desire by describing specific, repeated preparatory actions at a specific location.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** This would be Indicator. The post contains clear explicit suicide intent, specific method, and strong preparatory actions, so it is not an Indicator.

    **Decision between Ideation and Behavior:**
    The presence of a specific method (""jump"" from ""hospital parking garage ledge"") and, critically, repeated, concrete ""preparation evidence"" (going to the specific location, standing/sitting on the ledge for an hour, actively trying to work up the nerve) elevates this from Ideation to **Behavior**. This is not just thinking about it; it's acting out the preparation for the act.

3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While no explicit ""tonight,"" the repeated, sustained ""preparation"" at the location indicates an ongoing, active state of risk.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The statement ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"" is a reflection on lack of courage, not a rejection of the desire to die or the act itself, as they still ""go hoping I'll gain the courage."" Therefore, no downgrade.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"**CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""The first time I tried committing suicide"", ""die in combat"" (past vow), ""multiple attempts on my life"", ""my death seems to ultimate answer"", ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself"".
*   **Indirect death references:** ""want to disappear"" - None directly, but ""my death seems to ultimate answer"" implies it.
*   **Emotional markers:** ""struggling with depression"", ""life is going absolutely shitty"", ""hated myself"", ""hopeless"", ""mentally exhausting"", ""all I caused was problems"", ""drove everyone away"". Strong indicators of hopelessness, worthlessness, and unbearable pain.
*   **Specific methods:** ""phone charger since I couldn't find rope"" (for past attempt), ""die in combat"" (past ideation), ""searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"" (current search for methods).
*   **Preparations:** ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"" - This indicates active research/preparation for a method.
*   **Past actions:** ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger"", ""After attempting"", ""I have multiple attempts on my life"". These are clear descriptions of past suicide attempts.

**INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The writer states ""my death seems to ultimate answer"" and ""I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself"". This shows active suicidal desire and intent.
*   **Passive experience:** Not present.
*   **Rejection noted?:** ""every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through."" This is a *reason for hesitation* or *delay*, not an explicit rejection or disavowal of the suicidal thoughts or the active search for methods. The intent to find a way to die is still present and acted upon (searching).

**TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""The first time I tried committing suicide"", ""multiple attempts on my life"".
*   **Present intent:** ""my life is going absolutely shitty"", ""my death seems to ultimate answer"", ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself"". This indicates current active ideation and preparatory behavior.
*   **Future ideation:** ""die in combat"" (past vow, not current plan).

**CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
1.  Start here →
2.  a) Any past suicide attempt described? → **Yes**. The post explicitly states: ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life"".

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Applied:**
*   **Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy):** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since past attempts are clearly described, this rule dictates the 'Attempt' category.
*   **Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade):** The mention of family pain is a deterrent, not a rejection of the underlying desire or the active search for methods. The user is still actively seeking ways to die. Therefore, this rule does not apply to downgrade the classification.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: None.
    *   Indirect death references: ""more dead inside"" (metaphorical for emotional numbness/pain), ""Im done with everything"" (expresses profound exhaustion and despair, but not explicitly suicidal intent).
    *   Emotional markers: Feeling unvalued (""nobody cares about me""), betrayal (""faking everything""), hopelessness (""no results""), despair (""done with everything"").
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: No explicit statement of wanting to die or kill oneself. ""Im done with everything"" is ambiguous; it could mean done with life, or done with trying in relationships/situations. Given the context of being ""played with"" and ""getting no results,"" it leans towards being done with *situations* rather than life itself, though it signifies extreme distress.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No explicit suicidal thoughts are stated to be rejected.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: No explicit present intent to die. ""Im done with everything"" describes a current emotional state, not a plan for suicide.
    *   Future ideation: No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. There is no explicit suicide intent.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. The post does not contain explicit phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead."" ""Im done with everything"" is not equivalent to an explicit desire to die; it's a statement of profound emotional exhaustion and giving up on current struggles.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post expresses general unhappiness, hopelessness, and despair (""nobody cares about me,"" ""done with everything,"" ""more dead inside""). ""More dead inside"" is a clear metaphor. There are no active expressions of suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Fits perfectly. The post describes ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" and uses ""Metaphorical death references"" (""more dead inside""). It contains ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire.""

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: N/A (no higher categories present).
3.  Immediacy trumps: N/A.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** No explicit ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window"" strongly imply ending one's life.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""less scary"", ""getting more courage"" indicate an internal struggle and progression towards the act.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window"" - specific method (jumping) and location (bedroom window).
    *   **Preparations:** ""getting more courage"" is mental preparation, but not physical acquisition of means or writing notes.
    *   **Past actions:** None described.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I think I can jump off."", ""I'm getting more courage to jump..."", ""Hopefully I can do it soon."" - The writer actively owns the thoughts and is moving towards the action.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm getting more courage"" indicates an ongoing process towards action.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" suggests a near-future desire, not a vague ""someday.""

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **Start here →**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
        *   No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → BEHAVIOR**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, the desire to ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window"" clearly indicates suicidal intent.
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""jump out of my bedroom window"" is a specific method and location.
        *   **Preparation:** ""getting more courage"" indicates mental preparation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" is not ""tonight"" or ""right now,"" but it's more immediate than vague ideation and combined with the specific method, it points to an actionable plan.

    *   **Evaluation against definitions:**
        *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is explicit suicidal desire and a specific method, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
        *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post contains a *specific method* (""jump out of my bedroom window"") and not just a non-actionable desire or method. The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation states it becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with ""tonight"" or ""now"", but the Behavior definition *also* includes ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"" as a standalone qualifier. The presence of a specific method and location, combined with the active process of ""getting more courage"" and desire to do it ""soon,"" moves it beyond mere ideation.
        *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post has explicit suicidal intent, a specific method (""jump out of my bedroom window""), and an active process (""getting more courage"") towards executing it ""soon."" This meets the criteria for ""Intent + Capability"" as a specific method is stated.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
        2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt. Behavior is the highest applicable.
        3.  Immediacy trumps: ""Soon"" isn't ""tonight"", but the *specific method* is a strong factor for Behavior.
        4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection.
        5.  Output exactly one: Will output 'behavior'.

    The combination of clear intent, a specific method/location, and the active mental preparation (""getting more courage"") to act ""soon"" strongly classifies this as **Behavior**.

203,"Should I tell my mom about my issues. I know most peoples first reaction is ""yes, having help only makes it better"" but I feel like I don't really have that relationship with her. There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time. It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""writing suicide notes"" (this is a direct reference to a suicide-related action/preparation).
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""low energy"", ""depression hits really hard"", ""hate talking about myself"", ""waste their time"", ""feel like I don't really have that relationship with her"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** ""writing suicide notes"" – This is a clear preparation for suicide.
    *   **Past actions:** The phrase ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" describes a recurring past action, not a single past *attempt*.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer states ""I'm writing suicide notes,"" indicating they are the agent of this action. While presented as a consequence of depression, it is an action *they* perform, not an intrusive thought they are rejecting.
    *   **Passive experience:** The phrasing ""next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" suggests a reactive or almost automatic behavior when depression is severe, but it is still an active behavior performed by the individual.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** No explicit rejection or disavowal of the suicidal intent implied by writing notes. The post seeks advice on other issues, but not on stopping the note-writing itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""sometimes... I'm writing suicide notes"" describes a recurring pattern of behavior/preparation in the past. It's not a one-time historical attempt.
    *   **Present intent:** No immediate plans (""doing it tonight,"" ""right now"") are stated.
    *   **Future ideation:** No non-specific future timing.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. ""Writing suicide notes"" is a preparation, not an attempt (e.g., ""tried to overdose"").
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Implied strongly by ""writing suicide notes.""
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** ""writing suicide notes"" is explicitly listed under ""Preparation evidence"" in the **Behavior** definition.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No immediate timeline.
        *   *Conclusion for b):* The presence of ""writing suicide notes"" directly matches the ""Preparation evidence"" criterion for **Behavior**. Even though it's a recurring past action, it signifies ongoing capability and intent when depression hits hard.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** This would be Ideation. However, ""writing suicide notes"" goes beyond mere desire; it's a concrete preparation.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** This would be Indicator. The act of ""writing suicide notes"" is much more than just distress or rejected thoughts.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, ""I'm writing suicide notes.""
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not an Attempt. Fits Behavior due to preparation.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy mentioned, so this rule doesn't change the classification.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of the suicidal action/intent.

The most fitting category is **Behavior** because the post describes a specific preparation for suicide (""writing suicide notes""), which is a key criterion for this category, despite the lack of an immediate timeline or explicit statement of ""I want to die"" in the present moment. The recurring nature of this preparation indicates a pattern of intent and capability.

    *   **Specific methods:** None
    *   **Preparations:** None
    *   **Past actions:** None

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""hope i die"" is an active wish.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** The phrase ""idk maybe i just need attention yes its all a ruse for attention"" is present. This needs careful consideration against the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule. The rule states: ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator. The post does *not* explicitly state ""I don't actually want to."" Instead, it states that the *reason* for the post might be attention-seeking. Someone can genuinely hope to die *and* be seeking attention by expressing this. The statement about attention is about the *motivation* for the post, not a direct disavowal of the suicidal desire itself. Therefore, it does not meet the strict criteria for a rejection downgrade to Indicator. The ""hope i die"" remains an active suicidal desire.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""hope i die"" is a general, non-specific present/future desire.
    *   **Future ideation:** Yes, non-specific timing.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent (""hope i die""): Yes.
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline (""tonight"", ""right now""): No.
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit wish to die (""hope i die""): Yes.
        *   Non-actionable methods/No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes.
        *   This strongly points to IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts →
        *   It is *not* ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts because it contains ""hope i die,"" which is an explicit expression of active suicidal desire. As determined in Intent Analysis, the ""ruse for attention"" does not function as a clear rejection of the suicidal desire itself, as per the framework's specific phrasing for rejection.

**Conclusion:** The post contains an explicit wish to die (""hope i die"") without any specific plan, method, or immediate timeline. The statement about seeking attention does not negate the explicit suicidal desire according to the framework's ""Rejection downgrade"" rule.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

    *   Indirect death references: ""cut to deep"" implies severe self-harm, potentially life-threatening.
    *   Emotional markers: ""fuck"" indicates distress, pain, or frustration.
    *   Specific methods: ""cut"" (implies a sharp object).
    *   Preparations: Not applicable, as the action is described as having just occurred.
    *   Past actions: ""Just cut"" explicitly indicates a very recent past action of self-harm.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The writer is describing their own action (""Just cut"").
    *   Passive experience: Not passive.
    *   Rejection noted?: No rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""Just cut"" clearly indicates a past action.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → Yes. The phrase ""Just cut to deep"" describes an ""actual self-harm"" action. While explicit suicidal intent (""I wanted to die"") is not stated, the severity implied by ""to deep"" in the context of suicide risk assessment strongly suggests a suicidal act or a very serious act of self-harm. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" and ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"". Since this is a concrete, past action of self-harm, it fits the 'Attempt' category. The ""Irreducible Rule"" #2 (Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation) also supports this, as it's a completed action.

    *   This is not 'Behavior' because 'Behavior' implies intent *for a future or imminent act* (e.g., ""I'm going to do it tonight""). This post describes something that has *just happened*.
    *   This is not 'Ideation' as it's a physical act, not just a thought or desire.
    *   This is not 'Indicator' as it's a concrete act of self-harm, not just general distress or metaphorical language.

    Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most fitting category.

While the context implies they are in a suicidal crisis (due to the quoted ""don't do it!""), their *own* words in this post do not express active suicidal desire.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post is filled with distress (anger, frustration, feeling misunderstood). The quoted ""don't do it!"" indicates a context of suicidal ideation, but the author's own contribution is a rejection of the *responses* to that state, not an affirmation of suicidal intent. The phrase ""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice"" aligns with experiencing involuntary, overwhelming thoughts or feelings, fitting the ""rejected/intrusive thoughts"" aspect of the Indicator category. There is no active suicidal desire expressed by the author.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" (fits the tone of anger and frustration stemming from deep distress). ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"" (The ""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice"" suggests an involuntary, difficult state, similar to intrusive thoughts). ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" (fits, as the author's words are a critique of others' responses, not a statement of their own desire to die).

The ""but don't at the same time"" acts as a rejection/disavowal, downgrading the potential 'ideation' to 'indicator'. The definition for 'Indicator' includes ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"", which perfectly describes the internal conflict expressed.
*   **Rule 5 (Output exactly one):** Will output one category.

Based on the explicit rejection/ambivalence of the suicidal thought, the post falls into the 'Indicator' category, as it describes distress and a rejected/ambivalent suicidal thought rather than an active, unrejected desire.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicidal thoughts"", ""thinking about partially planning to die"", ""want to justify dying"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""I fear I only hurt"", ""it would have a really bad impact"" (referring to their potential death).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""guilty"", ""anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse"", ""feel terrible"", ""impulsive and sporadic"", ""terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive"", ""don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage"".
    *   **Specific methods:** ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips"" (explicitly states a *lack* of specific, reliable methods).
    *   **Preparations:** ""thinking about partially planning to die"" (this is a thought *about* planning, not concrete preparation evidence like buying pills or writing a note).
    *   **Past actions:** None described.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer actively states ""I've been having suicidal thoughts"", ""I've been thinking about it most of the time"", ""want to justify dying"", and ""thinking about partially planning to die"". These are their own thoughts and desires.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit rejection of the suicidal intent (""but I won't do it""). The hesitation is about *sharing* the thoughts with a friend, not about disavowing the thoughts themselves.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now"", ""for the past few months"" (describes the duration of the ideation).
    *   **Present intent:** ""every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying"", ""I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die"". The desire and thoughts are current and ongoing.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning"" (suggests a potential future escalation if things worsen, but no immediate plan).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""want to justify dying"", ""thinking about partially planning to die"").
        *   **Specific method:** No. The post explicitly states ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips"".
        *   **Preparation:** ""thinking about partially planning to die"" is a thought process, not concrete ""preparation evidence"" (like ""bought pills, wrote note""). It's still in the realm of ideation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No. There is no mention of ""tonight"", ""right now"", or ""this weekend"". The post is focused on the internal struggle and the decision to confide in a friend.

    **Evaluating against Category Definitions:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *are* expressions of active suicidal desire (""want to justify dying"").
    *   **Ideation:** Fits well. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"". Yes, ""want to justify dying"". ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"". Yes, ""not many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips"" implies non-actionable or absent methods. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". The ""partially planning"" is a thought process, not concrete preparation, and there's no immediate timeline.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. No specific method, no concrete preparation evidence (like acquiring means), and no imminent timeline. The ""thinking about partially planning"" is not concrete enough to meet the ""Preparation evidence"" criteria for Behavior, especially when paired with the lack of specific methods and immediacy.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempt is described.

    **Irreducible Rules Check:**
    1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
    2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, no behavior (as defined by concrete action/immediacy), so Ideation is the highest applicable.
    3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.
    4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection of suicidal thoughts/desire.
    5.  Output exactly one: Will do.

The post clearly expresses active suicidal desire and ongoing thoughts, including thoughts about planning, but lacks a specific method, concrete preparation steps, or an immediate timeline. This aligns perfectly with the Ideation category.

    *   **Specific methods:** ""hang myself.""
    *   **Preparations/Plans:** ""I've been thinking I could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as I can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself."" This describes a specific sequence of actions to facilitate the method and location.
    *   **Past actions:** ""ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears."" (This describes past *ideation* and *fear*, not a past attempt).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer states ""I'm an ugly useless stupid girl who is better off dead."" and ""now i really don't care any more"" (referring to no longer being scared to end it). The statement ""I've been thinking I could just drive out... to hang myself"" shows active consideration and ownership of the plan.
    *   **Passive experience:** None.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No rejection. The post explicitly states ""now i really don't care any more"" regarding previous fears that prevented action.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Mentions past ideation (""knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it""). No past attempt.
    *   **Present intent:** ""now i really don't care any more"" (about ending it). ""I've been thinking I could just drive out into the mountains and... hang myself"" indicates current, active planning.
    *   **Future ideation:** The plan itself (driving out, hiking, finding a spot, hanging) is future-oriented but described with specific steps, making it actionable.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No. The post mentions past *fear* of ending it, not an attempt.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""better off dead"", ""no reason to keep going"", ""I could just... hang myself"").
        *   **Specific method:** Yes (""hang myself"").
        *   **Preparation/Plan:** Yes, the detailed description ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as I can from paths and find a nice little spot"" constitutes a concrete, actionable plan for *how* to carry out the method, including a location. This goes beyond mere ideation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Not explicitly ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but the level of detail in the plan (""I've been thinking I could just..."") indicates a current, actionable plan rather than abstract ideation. The presence of a specific method and a detailed plan for executing it (location, steps) moves it into the 'Behavior' category, even without an explicit ""tonight"" timeline.

    *   **Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal intent, a specific method, and a detailed, actionable plan for carrying it out. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** No explicit disavowal like ""but I won't do it."" The frustration is with the *persistence* of the thoughts and the lack of improvement despite efforts, not a rejection of the suicidal desire itself.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? → No. There is no explicit desire to die.
   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? → Yes. The post describes general unhappiness, hopelessness, despair, and a lack of motivation, all fitting ""Distress without actionable suicide intent"". There are no active suicidal desires, plans, or past attempts.

Category Definitions Check:
- **Indicator**: ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" - This perfectly matches the post's content. There are no expressions of active suicidal desire.

    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""i wish i wasn't like this :("" (distress, self-dislike)
    *   Specific methods: ""putting eye drops in his beverages"" is identified as a *specific* method idea.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The phrase ""i'd be lying if i said that didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method"" suggests the idea is present and considered.
    *   Passive experience: ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can"" indicates an attempt to control these thoughts.
    *   Rejection noted? **YES.** ""because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that."" This is a clear and explicit rejection of acting on the suicidal thoughts/ideas.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: The ""idea"" is present. No immediate timeline.
    *   Future ideation: No specific future plan.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → While there's a specific method *idea*, the critical intent analysis reveals a rejection of the *desire to act*. So, it doesn't meet the ""explicit suicide intent"" for *action*.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and an ""idea of a new suicide method"". If not for the rejection, this would lean towards Ideation.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts →
        *   General unhappiness/despair: ""i wish i wasn't like this :(""
        *   Rejected/intrusive thoughts: ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that."" This perfectly fits the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" criterion. The ""idea of a new suicide method"" is presented as an intrusive thought that the writer explicitly states they do not want to act upon.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
*   **Rejection downgrade:** The rule ""Rejection downgrade: 'I don't actually want to' → indicator"" is directly applicable here due to ""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that."" This overrides the presence of a specific method idea.

**Final Decision:** The explicit rejection of the desire to act on suicidal thoughts, despite their presence and the generation of a method idea, places this post in the Indicator category according to the framework's rules.

    *   **Rejection noted?** No. The ""sabotaged myself"" refers to a *past* interruption, not a current rejection of suicidal thoughts. In fact, the ending suggests a desire to overcome that past self-sabotage and act.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** The core of the post describes a past event: ""A month ago I wrote a suicide note. ... Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself."" This is a clear description of an *aborted* suicide attempt.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out..."" (Present desire to return to a state of suicidal planning/intent).

    *   **Conclusion:** Since a past suicide attempt (aborted) is described, this takes precedence over any current ideation or potential future behavior due to the ""Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation"" rule.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
*   1. Writer-focused: Yes.
*   2. Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. The presence of a past attempt overrides the current desire to re-engage with suicidal thoughts or future ideation.
*   3. Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as 'Attempt' is the highest category here.
*   4. Rejection downgrade: No rejection of suicidal thoughts; rather, a desire to re-experience and potentially act on them.
*   5. Output exactly one: Will output 'attempt'.

215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay. I am hanging on by threads at this moment. trying to find things in the world to enjoy like I did when i was much younger. As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone,"" ""I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known."" (These imply being gone/dead). ""I am hanging on by threads at this moment."" (Metaphor for extreme distress, close to breaking point).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""suffering,"" ""don't feel it will ever end,"" ""utter hell,"" ""alone and forgotten,"" ""just a stain upon the world,"" ""crying,"" ""forsaken,"" ""pain,"" ""tension,"" ""rotten pit,"" ""outcast,"" ""demons... consume me,"" ""endless pain."" (Strong indicators of hopelessness, worthlessness, and unbearable emotional/physical pain).
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None related to suicide attempts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** No direct ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself."" The statement ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" is an observation about their perceived lack of impact, not an active desire for death.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not presented as intrusive thoughts.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** YES. ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain."" This is a clear statement of a reason *not* to act on any suicidal feelings, indicating a struggle to stay alive and find meaning. This acts as a strong disavowal or counter-force.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes past abuse, health issues, and feeling like an outcast. No past suicide attempts.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I am hanging on by threads at this moment."" (Describes current state of distress, not current intent to die). ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present"" (Current effort to *not* give up).
    *   **Future ideation:** ""don't feel it will ever end"" (Future hopelessness, not future suicide ideation).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. There is no explicit intent, method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. The post does not contain an explicit wish to die (""want to die""). The closest is ""world would not change if I were gone,"" which is an observation of perceived worthlessness, not a direct desire for death.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This is the best fit.
        *   General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair: Abundantly present throughout the post.
        *   Metaphorical death references: ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone,"" ""I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known,"" and ""I am hanging on by threads."" These are metaphorical or indirect references to being gone/giving up, not direct suicide statements.
        *   Rejected/intrusive thoughts: The statement ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain"" is a clear rejection of giving up, indicating a will to live despite suffering. This aligns with the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule.
        *   NO expressions of active suicidal desire: Confirmed.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post expresses profound distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness, using metaphorical language related to death (""world would not change if I were gone""). However, it critically lacks any explicit statement of suicidal desire (""I want to die"") or any plan/immediacy. Most importantly, it includes a clear statement of a reason to live and a current effort to find worth, which acts as a disavowal of suicidal action. According to the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule, this pushes the classification to 'Indicator'.

    *   This combination strongly points to **BEHAVIOR**.

**Check against Category Definitions and Irreducible Rules:**
*   The post contains explicit suicide desire (""make me want to die"", ""I'm done with life"").
*   It includes specific methods (""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself from a tree"").
*   It provides an imminent timeline (""So Tuesday"").
*   This perfectly matches the ""Behavior"" category definition: ""Specific method stated... Imminent timeline... Expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details"" (here we have both method and timeline).
*   No past attempt is mentioned, so ""Attempt"" is ruled out.
*   The intent is active and specific, not just general distress or rejected thoughts, ruling out ""Indicator"" and ""Ideation"".
*   Irreducible Rules: Writer-focused (yes), Temporal hierarchy (N/A, no attempt), Immediacy trumps (yes, ""Tuesday"" is imminent), Rejection downgrade (no rejection), Output exactly one (will be 'behavior').

**Conclusion:** The presence of explicit intent, specific methods, and an imminent timeline clearly classifies this as Behavior.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicidal thoughts"", ""better if I was dead"", ""suicide is selfish"", ""suicide would be better"", ""eternal sleep? Sign me up please"", ""next morning I'm dead?"", ""dead son"".
*   **Indirect death references:** ""everyone dies eventually"", ""eternal sleep"".
*   **Emotional markers:** The user describes a philosophical struggle with the point of life (""Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end?""), a feeling of emptiness after playing games, and a lack of fear of death. However, they explicitly state ""I don't think I am depressed"" and list many positive aspects of their life (friends, family support, hobbies, motivation, looking forward to the next day).
*   **Specific methods:** None mentioned. ""Eternal sleep"" is a concept, not a method.
*   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **Past actions:** No past suicide attempts described. The anecdote about the robbery indicates a lack of fear of death, not a past attempt.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The user actively endorses the idea of being dead: ""I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better."" and ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please."" and ""suicide would be better.""
*   **Passive experience:** ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" is initially passive, but the subsequent statements clarify active desire.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** Crucially, yes. The user explicitly states, ""Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish."" They then elaborate on multiple reasons why they *won't* act on these thoughts due to the impact on their dog, loved ones, friends, and parents. This is a clear rejection of the *action* of suicide, despite the underlying desire for death.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** No past attempts or specific past plans.
*   **Present intent:** No present plans or immediate timeline. The thoughts are current.
*   **Future ideation:** The desire for death is framed as a general future state (""better if I was dead"", ""eternal sleep""), not a specific future plan.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** Explicit suicide intent is present, but there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. Thus, not BEHAVIOR.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** The user expresses an explicit wish to die/be dead (""better if I was dead"", ""eternal sleep? Sign me up please""). There is no actionable plan or immediate timeline. This aligns with IDEATION.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** While there is distress (philosophical struggle, suicidal thoughts) and some metaphorical language (""eternal sleep""), the user *does* express active suicidal desire. However, the strong rejection of the *action* of suicide due to external factors is a key element.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator. This is the most critical rule for this post. The user states ""Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish."" This indicates that while the *desire* for death is present, the *action* of suicide is being actively rejected due to its perceived consequences for others. This aligns with the spirit of the ""rejection downgrade"" rule, as the user is actively choosing *not* to act on the desire. The desire for death is present and endorsed, but the intent to *commit* suicide is explicitly negated by protective factors.

Given the explicit desire for death (""better if I was dead"", ""eternal sleep? Sign me up please"") combined with a clear and strong rejection of the *action* of suicide due to external factors (""Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish"" and subsequent explanations), the post falls into the **Indicator** category. The desire for death is present, but the intent to act is negated by strong protective factors, indicating a struggle with thoughts rather than a progression towards a plan.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""more suicidal"" (indicates a current state of heightened suicidal ideation).
*   **Indirect death references:** None.
*   **Emotional markers:** ""worried"", ""paranoid"", ""irrational"" (related to the hotline experience, not directly suicidal pain, but points to distress).
*   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.

*   **Past actions:** ""Last time I called a hotline... didn't have a method or anything, I ended up having the cops called on me and they came to my dorm room and I got stuck in a psych ward for 3 days."" This describes a past *intervention* due to suicidal ideation, but the user explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything,"" confirming it was not a past *attempt*.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there"" indicates an active, current, and intensified suicidal state. The question about hotlines is driven by a need to address these feelings.
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts. The rejection is of the *intervention* (cops/psych ward), not the suicidal ideation itself.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** Description of a past hotline call and its negative consequences.
*   **Present intent:** ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there"" refers to a current or very recent state. The question ""is there a hotline I can call or text..."" indicates a present need to seek support for these feelings.
*   **Future ideation:** None.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The user explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" for the past incident. So, not 'ATTEMPT'.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""made me 10x more suicidal"" clearly indicates this.
    *   **Specific method/preparation:** No.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** No immediate timeline for an *action* (e.g., ""doing it tonight""). The immediacy is about finding a hotline.
    *   Therefore, not 'BEHAVIOR'.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
    *   **Explicit wish to die:** While not ""I want to die,"" the phrase ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there"" functions as an explicit statement of current, heightened suicidal desire/ideation. The user is actively seeking a way to manage these feelings.
    *   **Non-actionable methods:** N/A (no methods mentioned).
    *   **No preparation or immediate timeline:** Correct, for an *action*.
    *   This fits the definition of 'IDEATION'. The user is expressing a current suicidal state and seeking help for it, without detailing a specific plan or immediate intent to act.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No. The statement ""10x more suicidal"" goes beyond general distress and is not metaphorical or rejected.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, analysis is on the user's statements.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No attempt, no behavior, so ideation is the highest applicable.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediate action stated.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Thoughts are not rejected; the intervention is.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output one category.

The post clearly conveys a current state of increased suicidality (""10x more suicidal"") and a desire to seek help for it, but without specifying a method, preparation, or immediate intent to act on those thoughts. This aligns perfectly with 'Ideation'.

Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** The post directly quotes someone saying ""If you are actually suicidal... you would've told no one and just ended it silently"". The writer then refutes this, stating ""They won't believe it until I die."" This is a strong implicit reference to their own potential death by suicide as a consequence of their feelings being dismissed.
*   **Indirect death references:** ""until I die.""
*   **Emotional markers:** Rage, anger, frustration, feeling misunderstood, neglected, not cared for, needing help.
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** ""BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT"" refers to past attempts to ask for help, not a suicide attempt.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The writer is expressing intense frustration and anger because their feelings, which are clearly linked to suicidal distress (given the context of the quote they are reacting to), are being dismissed. The statement ""They won't believe it until I die"" is a powerful, albeit implicit, endorsement of the idea that their own death (by suicide, in this context) is a real possibility if their distress continues to be ignored.
*   **Passive experience:** Not passive.
*   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts. The phrases ""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP."" indicate a struggle to cope and a desire for support to *prevent* a suicidal outcome, but they do not negate the presence of the underlying suicidal ideation. Rule 4 states a rejection downgrade only applies if there's an explicit ""I don't actually want to."" This post doesn't say that; it says ""I'm holding on"" and ""I need help,"" which are calls for intervention, not a disavowal of the suicidal thoughts themselves.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT"" (past help-seeking).
*   **Present intent:** ""IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP."" (current struggle).
*   **Future ideation:** ""They won't believe it until I die."" This points to a potential future event (their death) as a consequence of their current situation, strongly implying suicidal ideation.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** The phrase ""They won't believe it until I die"" in the context of being accused of ""attention seeking"" for suicidal feelings, serves as a strong implicit expression of suicidal intent or a prediction of their own suicidal death. It's not a direct ""I want to die,"" but it's a statement about their potential death as a consequence of their ignored distress.
    *   **Specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline:** None are present. Therefore, it does not qualify for BEHAVIOR.

*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
    *   The statement ""They won't believe it until I die,"" when read in context, functions as an expression of suicidal desire or a strong prediction of their own suicidal death if their feelings are continually dismissed. The entire post revolves around the invalidation of their *suicidal* feelings. The ""holding on"" and ""needing help"" indicate a struggle against acting on these feelings, but the underlying ideation is clearly present. This fits the definition of Ideation: ""Explicit wish to die"" (even if implicitly stated through a consequence) without a specific plan or immediate timeline.

*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
    *   This is more than *only* distress or metaphors. The ""until I die"" statement is a direct, albeit implicit, reference to their own death, not a metaphor. It's also not a rejected thought; it's a statement about a potential future outcome that the writer is struggling to avoid by ""holding on"" and ""needing help."" The core of the post is about the validity of their suicidal feelings.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses intense distress and anger at the invalidation of their feelings, which are clearly related to suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""They won't believe it until I die"" is a strong implicit expression of suicidal ideation, indicating a potential future suicidal act if their cries for help continue to be ignored. While they are ""trying to hold on"" and ""need help,"" these are attempts to *avert* the suicidal outcome, not a rejection of the underlying ideation. There is no specific plan or immediate timeline.

    *   **Past actions:** ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer"" refers to past seeking help/trying to cope, not a past suicide attempt.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I feel like killing my self every day"", ""Im sad to say this might be my final good bye"". The writer claims ownership of these thoughts and feelings.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No rejection; the post indicates acceptance of the intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Reference to past attempts to cope (""gave it a chance"").
    *   **Present intent:** ""I feel like killing my self every day"", ""Everythings ready"", ""this might be my final good bye"". This indicates current, active intent with a strong sense of readiness and potential immediacy.
    *   **Future ideation:** The ""final good bye"" points to an imminent future, not just non-specific ideation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The post describes past *coping attempts* but not past *self-harm actions*.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""I feel like killing my self"", ""this might be my final good bye"".
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** Yes, ""suicide note"" is explicitly mentioned as prepared, and ""Everythings ready, bills, testament. it's all done"" signifies comprehensive preparation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""this might be my final good bye"" strongly implies an imminent timeline. ""Everythings ready"" also suggests readiness for immediate action.

    Based on the explicit mention of preparation (""suicide note"", ""Everythings ready"") and the strong implication of an imminent timeline (""final good bye""), this post fits the criteria for **BEHAVIOR**. It moves beyond mere ideation due to the concrete steps taken (preparation) and the sense of impending action.

**Category Definitions with Key Clarifications Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicidal desire and preparations.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there are clear preparations and an imminent tone, not just a wish to die.
*   **Behavior:** Matches perfectly. ""Preparation evidence: wrote note"" is explicitly met with ""suicide note"". ""Imminent timeline: 'this might be my final good bye'"" qualifies. ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"" is also met by ""final good bye"" combined with ""Everythings ready"".
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past concrete self-harm action is described.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not an attempt. The preparations and imminent tone elevate it from ideation to behavior.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** ""this might be my final good bye"" and ""Everythings ready"" indicate immediacy, pushing it to Behavior.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection is present.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'behavior'.

222,"I'm holding it all in and i'm about to explode. I feel like I can't keep it to myself anymore or else i'm going to kms. I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting. I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog. I haven't talked to anyone in a long while and everyone thinks i'm ok. I'm not though. I don't know what to do anymore. I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kms"" (kill myself) appears multiple times (""going to kms"", ""about to kms"", ""gonna keep it all in and kms soon""), ""going to kill myself very soon"", ""I know I am"" (referring to killing self).
    *   **Indirect death references:** None beyond the direct suicide references.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""I'm about to explode"", ""can't keep it to myself anymore"", ""I'm not ok"", ""don't know what to do anymore"", ""can't get these thoughts out of my head"". These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""I can't stop cutting."" This is a specific self-harm method. While not explicitly stated as *the* planned suicide method, it's a form of self-harm that aligns with the ""Behavior"" category's mention of ""cutting"" as a specific method.
    *   **Preparations:** None explicitly stated (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
    *   **Past actions:** ""I can't stop cutting"" implies ongoing or recent past self-harm behavior. The user also mentions trying to talk to teachers/others for help, but these are not suicide attempts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am."" ""I'm about to kms."" ""I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon."" The writer clearly claims ownership of these thoughts and intentions.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""I can't get these thoughts out of my head"" indicates intrusive thoughts, but they are coupled with active endorsement of the intent.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** ""just not yet though I can't leave my dog."" This is a *reason for delay*, not a rejection or disavowal of the suicidal intent itself. The intent remains strong.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""I can't stop cutting"" (ongoing/recent past behavior).
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm about to kms"", ""I'm not ok.""
    *   **Future ideation:** ""going to kill myself very soon"", ""kms soon"". This indicates a definite future action, even if the exact timing is ""not sure when"" but ""very soon.""

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?**
        *   The phrase ""I can't stop cutting"" describes ongoing self-harm. While cutting *can* be an attempt, the post doesn't state it as a past, discrete suicide attempt (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself by cutting last week""). It describes a current, ongoing behavior. Therefore, it does not meet the ""Attempt"" definition of ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" as a past, completed action.

    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am."" and ""I'm about to kms.""
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""I can't stop cutting."" The ""Behavior"" definition explicitly lists ""cutting"" as a specific method.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes, ""I'm about to kms"" and ""very soon"" indicate a strong sense of immediacy and a near-future plan. The ""just not yet though I can't leave my dog"" is a mitigating factor that delays, but does not negate, the strong, stated immediate intent. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" ""I'm about to kms"" is an expression of immediate intent.

    *   **Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""I'm going to kill myself very soon"", ""I'm about to kms""), mentions a specific self-harm method (""I can't stop cutting""), and expresses a clear sense of immediacy (""about to"", ""very soon""). This combination aligns perfectly with the ""Behavior"" category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the strong sense of immediate intent and the specific method mentioned.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""wanna kill myself"", ""killing myself even more"", ""suicide notes"", ""if I do it"", ""my death"", ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""ruin their lives by killing myself"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** Intense anger, resentment, desire for revenge/punishment, hopelessness (""I don't care"").
    *   **Specific methods:** ""shoot myself"" (mentioned as a wish for immediate action).
    *   **Preparations:** ""found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash"" (past preparation, indicating a history of moving towards action).
    *   **Past actions:** ""Family found out that I wanna kill myself"" (past expression of desire), ""tried to give me an intervention"" (past response to user's expressed desire).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, the writer explicitly owns the suicidal thoughts and desires (""I wanna kill myself"", ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more"", ""I wish I could shoot myself on the spot"", ""They deserve to live... with the burden of my death"").
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** No disavowal; the desire is intensified.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Family finding out, intervention, past suicide notes.
    *   **Present intent:** ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more"" (current, heightened desire), ""I don't care"" (current state of mind), ""A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" (current intense desire for immediate action).
    *   **Future ideation:** The desire for ""my death on their shoulders"" is a future outcome, but driven by present intent.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The ""suicide notes"" are preparation, not an attempt. The post describes desires and past events, not a past action of self-harm with suicidal intent. (Not ATTEMPT)

    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, clearly present (""wanna kill myself"", ""killing myself even more"").
        *   **Specific method:** ""shoot myself"" is mentioned.
        *   **Preparation:** ""suicide notes I threw away"" indicates *past* preparation. While not *current* preparation for an *imminent* act, it shows a history of moving towards action.
        *   **Immediate timeline / Expressions of immediate intent:** The phrase ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" is crucial. While it contains ""wish I could"" (implying lack of current means), ""on the spot"" is synonymous with ""right now"" or ""immediately."" This expresses a very strong, immediate *desire* for action with a specific, lethal method. According to the ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior (""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details""), this strong desire for immediate action, especially when coupled with a specific method, pushes it beyond mere ideation. The user isn't just thinking about dying; they are expressing a powerful, present desire to act *immediately* with a specific means.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** This does not fit because of the strong desire for ""on the spot"" action with a specific method. This crosses the ""Key boundary"" for Ideation (""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'""). ""On the spot"" is equivalent to ""now.""

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        1.  Writer-focused: Yes, all analysis is on the user's statements.
        2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt is described.
        3.  Immediacy trumps: The ""on the spot"" desire is a strong indicator of immediacy.
        4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection, intent is intensified.
        5.  Output exactly one: Will output one category.

    **Decision:** The presence of explicit, intensified suicidal desire, the mention of a specific method (""shoot myself""), and the strong desire for *immediate* action (""on the spot""), along with the history of preparation (suicide notes), collectively indicate a high level of current risk. The ""wish I could"" implies a current lack of means, but the *intent* and *desire for immediate action* are present and strong, aligning with the ""Behavior"" category's expanded definition of immediate intent.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""OD"" (overdose, clearly implied as suicidal intent in context), ""suicide"" (mentioned as a long-standing thought).
*   **Indirect death references:** ""hope for the best"" (in the context of an overdose, implies hoping for death or an outcome like unconsciousness).
*   **Emotional markers:** ""can't feel anything right now,"" ""all I can think about,"" ""back here"" (suggests a return to a dark mental state).
*   **Specific methods:** ""popping all of them at once"" referencing specific medications (venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh, inderal). This is a concrete and specific method.
*   **Preparations:** ""I have a month's prescription for..."" indicates possession of the means.
*   **Past actions:** ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here."" This describes past *ideation*, not a past *attempt*.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""Think I'm going to OD today."" ""I feel like popping all of them at once."" This is a clear, active statement of intent and desire to act.
*   **Passive experience:** Not present.
*   **Rejection noted?:** No rejection or disavowal.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"" (past ideation).
*   **Present intent:** ""Think I'm going to OD today."" ""I feel like popping all of them at once."" This indicates immediate or very near-future intent.
*   **Future ideation:** Not the primary focus; the ""today"" makes it immediate.

    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. (Only past ideation is mentioned.)
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → Yes.
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** ""Think I'm going to OD today,"" ""I feel like popping all of them at once.""
        *   **Specific method:** ""popping all of them at once"" with named medications.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I have a month's prescription for..."" (possession of means).
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""today.""

**Conclusion based on Decision Tree and Category Definitions:**
The post clearly expresses explicit suicide intent (""Think I'm going to OD today,"" ""feel like popping all of them at once""), states a specific method (overdosing on named medications), indicates preparation (possession of the medications), and specifies an imminent timeline (""today""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of **Behavior**.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all statements are about the user's own thoughts and intentions.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No past attempt is mentioned, so this rule prioritizes Behavior over Ideation due to immediacy and specific intent.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** ""today"" is a strong indicator of immediacy, placing it in Behavior.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None directly.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""The end is the only thing that feels right now."" This phrase, especially combined with the preceding apologies and farewells, strongly implies the end of life by suicide. ""I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up."" reinforces a state of utter despair leading to this conclusion.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""Sorry,"" ""nothing left,"" ""completely used up,"" ""sorry I wasn't a better person"" – indicate profound hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and a sense of finality.
    *   **Specific methods:** None stated.
    *   **Preparations:** The post itself reads very much like a suicide note or a final farewell message. Addressing specific loved ones (""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson"") and offering apologies (""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt,"" ""I'm sorry I wasn't a better person"") are significant indicators of preparation for an imminent act.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""The end is the only thing that feels right now."" This is an active, present endorsement of dying/ending life.

    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal or rejection of these thoughts.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** ""The end is the only thing that feels right *now*."" This indicates an immediate or very near-future intent.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" clearly conveys this.
        *   Specific method: No.
        *   Preparation: Yes, the post functions as a farewell note, which is a strong form of preparation.
        *   Immediate timeline: Yes, ""right now"" indicates immediacy.
        *   Since there is explicit suicide intent *and* clear preparation (farewell note) *and* an immediate timeline (""right now""), this path leads to **BEHAVIOR**.

**Final Check against Definitions and Rules:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to active intent, preparation, and immediacy.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because it's more than just a wish; it includes elements of preparation (farewell note) and immediacy (""right now""), pushing it beyond mere ideation.
*   **Behavior:** This fits well. There is clear immediate intent (""The end is the only thing that feels right now"") and evidence of preparation (the post itself serving as a farewell/suicide note). The ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"" directly applies here with ""right now.""
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

**Irreducible Rules:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as only one category is strongly indicated.
3.  Immediacy trumps: ""right now"" supports Behavior over Ideation.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.
5.  Output exactly one: Will do.

The combination of clear intent (""The end is the only thing that feels right now""), the nature of the post as a farewell message (preparation), and the temporal marker (""right now"") strongly indicates the ""Behavior"" category.

        *   While an immediate timeline like ""tonight"" isn't explicitly stated, the strong present desire (""all I want to do is"") combined with a specific method qualifies for 'Behavior'. The definition for 'Behavior' includes ""Specific method stated"" as a primary criterion.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit active suicidal desire and specific method.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat"") is mentioned. Ideation is for non-actionable methods or lack of specification.
*   **Behavior:** Fits perfectly. The post contains ""Explicit suicide intent"" (""all I want to do..."") and a ""Specific method stated"" (""cutting my god damn throat""). This combination is a key criterion for Behavior.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kill yourself"" (within a quote).

*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** None.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** No. The user is quoting a passage and asking for more information (""Anyone know more about it?""). They are not stating ""I want to kill myself.""
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** Not explicitly, but the context is clearly an inquiry about a quote, not a personal statement of intent or distress. The user's focus is on the quote's origin/meaning.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** No.
*   **Present intent:** No.
*   **Future ideation:** No.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No. The ""kill yourself"" is part of a quote, not the user's personal intent.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No. The user is not expressing *their own* desire to die.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** This is the most fitting. While not direct ""distress"" in the typical sense, the post contains a reference to suicide (within a quote) but *lacks any active suicidal desire or intent from the user*. The user is merely discussing a concept or a piece of text that contains the reference. The key is the *absence of personal intent or distress*. It's a mention of the topic, not an expression of personal risk.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** The post is about a quote the writer encountered, not the writer's personal suicidal thoughts or actions. The ""kill yourself"" is attributed to the quote, not the writer.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no direct intent is present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** While not an explicit ""I don't want to,"" the *context* of asking for information about a quote implies a detachment from personal suicidal intent.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will classify as 'indicator'.

**Final Classification Logic:** The post mentions ""kill yourself"" but it is presented as part of a quote the user stumbled upon and is asking for information about. There is no expression of personal suicidal desire, intent, distress, or plan from the user. Therefore, it falls into the 'Indicator' category as it references the topic of suicide without expressing active personal risk.

    *   **Past actions:** ""always end up wanting to die"" refers to a recurring *desire*, not a past *attempt*.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, the writer uses ""I want to"", ""I'm ready"", ""I can't do this anymore"", clearly owning the thoughts and desires.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No, the phrase ""I've accepted that and now i'm ready"" indicates acceptance and readiness, not rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""never been truly happy since i was young"", ""always end up wanting to die"" (recurring past desire).
    *   **Present intent:** ""i want to leave earth"", ""i'm ready to join my dog"", ""i can't do this anymore"". These indicate a current, strong state of suicidal desire and readiness.
    *   **Future ideation:** The ""ready to join my dog"" implies a future action based on current intent, but without a specific timeline.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No. (The ""always end up wanting to die"" is a desire, not an attempt).
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""want to leave earth"", ""ready to join my dog"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No explicit ""tonight"", ""right now"", ""this weekend"". The phrase ""now i'm ready"" indicates a mental state of readiness, but not an *imminent action* or a concrete plan for *immediate execution*. It lacks the specificity of ""I'm doing it tonight"" or ""I'm going to do it now.""

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? Yes.
        *   ""Explicit wish to die"": ""want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", ""ready to join my dog"" fit this perfectly.
        *   ""Non-actionable methods"": No specific method is given.
        *   ""No preparation or immediate timeline"": This aligns. While ""now i'm ready"" expresses a current state of mind and desire, it does not specify *when* an action would occur, nor *how*. It's a readiness *to* act, not an immediate intent *to* act.

    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? No, there is clear, active suicidal desire.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post clearly expresses active suicidal desire (""I want to leave earth"", ""ready to join my dog""). It conveys a deep sense of hopelessness and resignation. However, it lacks any mention of a specific method, preparation, or an explicit immediate timeline for action (e.g., ""tonight"", ""right now""). The phrase ""now i'm ready"" signifies a strong mental state of acceptance and willingness to die, but it does not equate to an *imminent plan* or *immediate intent to act* as required for the ""Behavior"" category. It falls squarely within the definition of ""Ideation"" as an active suicidal desire without an actionable plan or immediacy.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, all analysis is on the writer's statements.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt described, so Ideation/Behavior are considered.
3.  Immediacy trumps: No explicit immediacy (like ""tonight"") to trump non-specific ideation. ""now i'm ready"" is a state of readiness, not an immediate action.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output one category.

My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit.""
    *   Present intent: Explicitly *rejected*. ""Now, I know I can't do that."" ""His passing has saved my life for the time being.""
    *   Future ideation: The rejection is ""for the time being,"" implying the underlying issues might persist (""Nothing has changed for me""), but the *active suicidal intent* is currently absent.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No. The post describes a past *plan/intent* (""was going to kill myself""), not an *actual self-harm action* or *interrupted attempt*.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? No. While there was past intent, it is explicitly *rejected* in the present. There is no *current* explicit intent, method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? No. The explicit desire (""was going to kill myself"") is in the past and is *currently rejected*. There is no *current* explicit desire to die.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? Yes. The post describes a past suicidal plan that is now explicitly *rejected* (""Now, I know I can't do that."", ""His passing has saved my life for the time being.""). The phrase ""Nothing has changed for me"" indicates underlying distress or issues may still exist, but the *suicidal intent* has been disavowed. This fits the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" aspect of the Indicator category, as the previously held intent is now being actively disavowed.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** The past intent is explicitly rejected, so it doesn't lead to a higher category in the present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as there is no current immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** This is the key rule here. The post contains a strong rejection of past suicidal intent (""Now, I know I can't do that."", ""His passing has saved my life for the time being."", ""I don't ever want to make my mother cry...""). This downgrades the risk from what *would have been* Ideation/Behavior to Indicator.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post clearly states a past suicidal plan (""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit"") but then explicitly and emphatically *rejects* that plan in the present due to a new perspective gained from a family loss (""Now, I know I can't do that."", ""His passing has saved my life for the time being.""). While the underlying issues might persist (""Nothing has changed for me""), the *active suicidal intent* is currently disavowed. This aligns with the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" aspect of the **Indicator** category.

230,"Am I faking my depression?. Ok so for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days. My home life isnt that good. Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""serious thoughts about suicide"", ""always think about suicide"", ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself"", ""actually want to commit suicide"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.

    *   **Specific methods:** ""easy painless ways to kill myself"" (general, not specific like ""pills"" or ""hanging"").

    *   **Past actions:** None described (no ""tried to"", ""attempted"").

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I had serious thoughts..."", ""I always think..."", ""I research..."", ""actually want to commit suicide"". This indicates active engagement with suicidal thoughts and exploration.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** The user expresses significant self-doubt: ""I feel like i'm doing it for attention"", ""feel like i'm faking it"", ""Am i being dramatic about this?"", ""Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it."" This is not a direct ""I don't actually want to"" rejection (which would downgrade to Indicator), but it shows strong ambivalence and internal conflict regarding the authenticity of the desire. However, the desire itself and the act of researching are still present.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts... for days."" (Describes a past pattern).
    *   **Present intent:** ""When we fight I always think about suicide."", ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself."" (Ongoing pattern, current active researching).
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future timeline (""doing it tonight"").

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Rule: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation).
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""actually want to commit suicide.""
        *   **Specific method:** No, ""easy painless ways"" is not specific.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No.
        *   **Preparation evidence:** ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself."" The Behavior definition's examples for ""Preparation evidence"" are ""bought pills, wrote note."" Researching is an exploratory step *prior* to concrete preparation like acquiring means or writing a note. It's not as direct or actionable as the examples provided. Therefore, it does not strictly meet the ""Preparation evidence"" criterion for Behavior.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   **Explicit suicide desire:** Yes, ""actually want to commit suicide.""
        *   **Without plan/immediacy:** Yes. There's no concrete plan (only exploration of ""painless ways"") and no immediate timeline. While ""researching"" is an active step, it falls short of the concrete preparation described for ""Behavior."" The self-doubt also suggests a lack of fully solidified intent required for ""Behavior.""

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No. The post contains explicit suicidal desire and active researching, which goes beyond mere distress or fully rejected thoughts. The self-doubt is not a complete rejection as per Rule 4 (""I don't actually want to"").

**Conclusion:**
The post clearly expresses active suicidal desire (""actually want to commit suicide"") and explores methods (""research for easy painless ways""). However, it lacks a specific method, an immediate timeline, or concrete preparation (like acquiring means) that would elevate it to ""Behavior"" based on the provided definitions and examples. The ""research"" is an active component, but it's more about exploring the *how* than actively preparing for an immediate attempt. The significant self-doubt also points towards a level of ambivalence that is more consistent with Ideation than Behavior.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The post expresses a belief that ""Life is useless"" and describes a desirable state *after* death. It also states ""Death and suicide need to be normalized."" This suggests an endorsement of the *concept* of suicide/death as a solution or a desirable state, but it does *not* explicitly state a personal desire to die (""I want to die"").

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** None.
*   **Present intent:** No immediate plan or timeline.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No explicit personal intent, no method, no preparation, no immediate timeline.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** The post contains ""Life is useless"" (despair) and describes a desirable state after death, and advocates for the normalization of suicide. However, it *lacks* an ""explicit wish to die"" such as ""I want to die"" or ""I don't deserve to live."" The statements are more general or philosophical about the concept of death/suicide rather than a direct personal declaration of suicidal desire.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** ""Life is useless"" clearly indicates general unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair. The descriptions of ""something better on the other side"" and the normalization of death/suicide can be interpreted as philosophical or metaphorical death references, or expressions of a general acceptance/desire for death without a direct personal intent to act. Crucially, there is NO expression of *active suicidal desire* in the form of ""I want to die"" or similar direct phrasing.

    *   **Indirect death references:** ""thought of death,"" ""never feel pain anymore,"" ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""be nothing in a black sea of infinity,"" ""let go."" These phrases collectively express a longing for the cessation of existence and suffering.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""never feel pain anymore,"" ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""holding on so tight"" implies significant pain/struggle and a desire for relief.

    *   **Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear desire for the state of death as an escape from suffering, without mentioning a specific plan or immediate timeline. This aligns with the definition of Ideation. It's not an Indicator because it's not just general distress or rejected thoughts; it's an active, positive contemplation of death as a desired outcome.

    *   **Past actions:** ""I used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore."" This describes a past mental state/deterrent, not a past attempt.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

    *   **Rejection noted?** The writer states, ""this is selfish and irrational, i know,"" but immediately follows with ""but honestly i just want to make one decision for myself for once no matter how fucking selfish it is."" This is an acknowledgment of a perceived negative aspect of the thought, but it is *not* a rejection or disavowal of the intent itself. In fact, it's a reaffirmation of the desire to act.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

    *   **Present intent:** ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and I don't think I can hold onto it any longer."" This indicates a current, precarious state of mind.
    *   **Future ideation/plan:** The plan is conditional on ""tomorrow"" (getting COVID test results) and ""if I'm positive"". This establishes a clear, *imminent* timeline once the condition is met.

        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""if I'm positive, I'll kill myself.""
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** The phrase ""I'll use any method I can"" indicates a willingness to act without a specific barrier of method. While not a *single* specific method, it implies capability. More importantly, the *imminent timeline* is present.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** The plan is conditional on ""tomorrow"" (getting results) and ""if I'm positive"". This makes the intent *imminent* upon the occurrence of a very near-future event. The ""Behavior"" definition includes ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"". A plan contingent on an event happening ""tomorrow"" falls within this temporal proximity. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior explicitly states that ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" The statement ""if I'm positive, I'll kill myself"" tied to a ""tomorrow"" event is an expression of immediate, conditional intent.

    *   This clearly goes beyond ""Ideation"" because Ideation is defined as having ""No preparation or immediate timeline."" This post has a clear, imminent, conditional timeline.

    *   *Result: BEHAVIOR.*

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all analysis is on the writer's own statements and intent.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No attempt is mentioned, so this rule doesn't apply for downgrading.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** The ""tomorrow"" / ""if positive"" condition creates immediacy, pushing it past Ideation.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**

    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""I might kill myself"" indicates the writer is actively considering or has a desire to die by suicide. The ""might"" suggests possibility, not rejection.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No explicit disavowal or rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: No immediate timeline (""might"" is not ""tonight"" or ""now"").
    *   Future ideation: ""I might kill myself"" indicates a future possibility, non-specific timing.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""I might kill myself"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (""might"" is not immediate).
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""I might kill myself"" expresses a desire or consideration).
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes (no method, no preparation, no immediate timeline).
        *   This leads to **IDEATION**.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, because there is an explicit statement of suicidal desire/consideration.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire (""I might kill myself"").
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"" - ""I might kill myself"" falls under this as an active consideration of suicide. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" is also true.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as only one category is strongly indicated.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable, no immediacy.
4.  Rejection downgrade: Not applicable, ""might"" is not a rejection.
5.  Output exactly one: Yes.

The phrase ""I might kill myself"" clearly articulates a suicidal thought/desire without providing a concrete plan, means, or an immediate timeline. This aligns directly with the definition of Ideation.

    The presence of a past suicide attempt is the highest priority category according to the rules and definitions. Even though there is clear future intent and ideation, the past attempt takes precedence.

**Final Classification Logic:** The post explicitly mentions a ""first failed attempt in October."" Per the ""Attempt"" category definition and the ""IRREDUCIBLE RULES"" (Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation; 'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt), this immediately classifies the post as 'attempt', overriding any other elements like future plans or present ideation.

The ""Attempt"" definition clearly states that mentioning a past attempt ""always"" leads to this category, and it ""overrules concurrent ideation/behavior"". Even though the user is in a positive recovery phase, the fact that they are discussing a recent attempt (one month ago) is the primary classification driver according to the framework.

As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all.

I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

    *   **Specific methods:** ""Zoloft overdose,"" ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"" – highly specific method (pills/overdose) and dosage.
    *   **Preparations:** Taking the pills is the action itself, not just preparation.
    *   **Past actions:** ""at 11:30 I took 6 pills"" describes a completed past action of self-harm. ""wasn't enough to kill me"" confirms the suicidal intent behind this past action.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""wasn't enough to kill me"" confirms the writer's active suicidal intent behind the overdose.
    *   **Passive experience:** N/A
    *   **Rejection noted?** The post is about the physical consequences of the past action, not a rejection of the original suicidal intent. The question ""will I be okay if I don't go to hospital?"" is a concern about the physical outcome of the overdose.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""at 11:30 I took 6 pills"" and ""It obviously wasn't enough to kill me"" clearly describe a past event and its outcome.
    *   **Present intent:** N/A
    *   **Future ideation:** N/A

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → Yes. The post explicitly states ""I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg and It obviously wasn't enough to kill me."" This is a clear description of a past action of self-harm with suicidal intent.
    *   According to the ""Attempt"" definition: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" and ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts."" This perfectly matches the post.
    *   Irreducible Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation) confirms that 'Attempt' is the correct classification when a past attempt is described.

At peace knowing it's soon. Hope my plan works though, there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", ""At peace knowing it's soon"", ""Hope my plan works"", ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"" (contextually implies ending life).
    *   Indirect death references: ""body that has clearly given up"" (in context of not wanting to live).
    *   Emotional markers: Calmness, peace (often associated with a firm decision to die).
    *   Specific methods: None explicitly stated.
    *   Preparations: ""my plan"" (implies a specific plan exists and potentially preparations have been made or are underway).
    *   Past actions: None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes. ""I've made my decision"", ""I feel so calm about it"", ""At peace knowing it's soon"", ""Hope my plan works"". The writer clearly owns the suicidal intent and decision.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: ""made my decision"", ""feel so calm"", ""At peace knowing it's soon"". This indicates a current, firm decision.
    *   Future ideation: ""soon"" (this is an imminent timeline, not a vague future thought like ""someday""). ""Hope my plan works"" points to an upcoming action.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → Yes.
        *   Explicit suicide intent: ""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", ""no way I'm living"".
        *   Preparation: ""my plan"" is strong evidence of a plan being in place, implying preparation.
        *   Immediate timeline: ""soon"" is an imminent timeline.
        *   The post combines a firm decision (""made my decision"") with an imminent timeline (""soon"") and the existence of a ""plan"" (implying capability/preparation). This aligns with the ""Behavior"" category's definition of ""Intent + Capability"" and its critical expansion: ""Expressions of immediate intent... qualify even without method details."" The phrase ""At peace knowing it's soon"" reinforces the immediacy and resolve.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        *   Writer-focused: Yes.
        *   Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so consider Behavior.
        *   Immediacy trumps: ""soon"" and ""my plan"" elevate this beyond mere ideation.
        *   Rejection downgrade: No rejection.

    *   **Category Definitions Check:**
        *   **Indicator**: Ruled out. There is clear active suicidal desire and intent.
        *   **Ideation**: Ruled out. This is beyond just a wish to die. There's a firm decision, a plan, and an imminent timeline (""soon""). The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation states it becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with ""tonight"" or ""now""; ""soon"" functions similarly in conveying immediacy and resolve.
        *   **Behavior**: Fits. There's explicit intent (""made my decision""), evidence of a plan (""my plan""), and an imminent timeline (""soon""). This demonstrates intent coupled with capability (having a plan) and immediacy.
        *   **Attempt**: Ruled out. No past action described.

The combination of a firm decision, the existence of a ""plan,"" and an imminent timeline (""soon"") strongly indicates a progression beyond mere ideation to a state of active preparation or intent for an imminent act.

I can deal with difficulties in life but realizing you're hopeless is too much. I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better. I just want to find an actual suicide forum.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicide forum"" - direct reference to suicide.
*   **Indirect death references:** None.
*   **Emotional markers:** ""Hopeless"", ""felt hopeless for months"", ""realizing you're hopeless is too much"" - indicates severe despair and unbearable pain. ""I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better"" indicates a fixed mindset and rejection of typical support.
*   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
*   **Preparations:** ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum"" - This is a statement of intent to seek out information or community related to suicide. While not acquiring means, it's a concrete step towards exploring suicide.
*   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The user states ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum."" This is an active desire to engage with suicide-related content, stemming from a deeply felt hopelessness. It implies an active suicidal desire, even if not phrased as ""I want to die.""
*   **Passive experience:** Not passive.
*   **Rejection noted?** No rejection of suicidal thoughts. Instead, there's a rejection of external encouragement, reinforcing the severity of their internal state.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""felt hopeless for months.""
*   **Present intent:** ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum."" This is a current desire.
*   **Future ideation:** No specific future timing beyond the present desire.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** The desire to find a ""suicide forum"" strongly implies an active suicidal desire, given the context of ""hopeless"" and ""too much."" While not ""I want to die,"" it's a clear indication of being actively focused on suicide.
    *   **Specific method/preparation:** No specific method. ""Finding an actual suicide forum"" is a step towards exploring means/methods, but it's not ""preparation evidence"" as defined (e.g., bought pills, wrote note).
    *   **Immediate timeline:** No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""right now"").

**Category Evaluation based on Definitions and Rules:**

*   **Indicator:** ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire."" This post *does* express an active desire related to suicide (seeking a suicide forum). Therefore, it's not an Indicator.
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"". While not using these exact phrases, the active desire to find a ""suicide forum"" in the context of overwhelming hopelessness serves as a strong proxy for an ""explicit wish to die"" or active suicidal desire. There is no specific plan or immediate timeline, which keeps it from being Behavior.
*   **Behavior:** Requires a specific method, preparation evidence (like acquiring means), or an imminent timeline. None of these are present. ""Finding a forum"" is not the same as acquiring means or writing a note.
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt described.

The post demonstrates active suicidal desire (implied by seeking a ""suicide forum"" due to hopelessness) without a specific plan, method, or immediate timeline. This fits the definition of **Ideation** best.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** N/A (no attempt/behavior).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** N/A (no immediacy).
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal thoughts; rather, a rejection of external encouragement.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""...trying to slash my wrists and die...""
    *   Indirect death references: ""...just want an end""
    *   Emotional markers: hopelessness (""low my expectations""), worthlessness (""disgusting to look at""), unbearable pain (""Why couldn't I get even that?"", ""idc just want an end"").
    *   Specific methods: ""slash my wrists""
    *   Preparations: Not explicitly stated, but ""on the verge of trying"" implies proximity to action.
    *   Past actions: ""I tried, I guess."" This is ambiguous. It could refer to a past attempt, or simply trying to cope/get away. Given the lack of specific detail about *what* was tried in a suicidal context, and the strong present intent, it's not a clear 'Attempt' trigger on its own.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die... idc just want an end."" This is a clear active endorsement of suicidal intent.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: The phrase ""even though I know it's painful idc"" is an acknowledgement of a deterrent (pain) but a *rejection* of its ability to stop the intent. This reinforces the active desire, rather than disavowing it.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""I tried, I guess."" (Ambiguous, not primary focus).
    *   Present intent: ""I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die..."" This indicates immediate or very near-future intent.
    *   Future ideation: No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? ""I tried, I guess."" is too vague to definitively meet the 'Attempt' definition (""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent""). It doesn't describe the action or intent clearly enough to be an 'Attempt'.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""trying to slash my wrists and die"").
        *   Specific method: Yes (""slash my wrists"").
        *   Immediate timeline: Yes (""on the verge of trying"").
        *   This combination strongly points to **BEHAVIOR**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** No, because there is active suicidal desire, a specific method, and an imminent timeline.
*   **Ideation:** No, because there is a specific method and an imminent timeline.
*   **Behavior:** Yes. The post states a specific method (""slash my wrists"") and an imminent timeline (""on the verge of trying""). It also expresses immediate intent (""idc just want an end""). This fits the definition perfectly.
*   **Attempt:** The initial ""I tried, I guess"" is not specific enough to qualify as a described past attempt of self-harm with suicidal intent. The primary and most actionable information is the current, imminent intent.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: The ""I tried, I guess"" is too vague to clearly be an 'Attempt'. The present intent is very clear and actionable.
3.  Immediacy trumps: ""on the verge of trying"" indicates immediacy.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection; the intent is reinforced.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output one.

The strongest and most definitive classification based on the provided framework is 'Behavior' due to the explicit intent, specific method, and imminent timeline.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I cannot wait to die""
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""at least the pain will all be gone"" (implies death as a solution), ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it"" (direct reference to planning for one's own funeral, strongly implying suicide).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""life is not able to be fixed,"" ""no-one I know has gone through the things I have gone through,"" ""pain will all be gone"" (hopelessness, isolation, unbearable pain).
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"" - This is a significant preparation for the *aftermath* of suicide, indicating concrete planning for the event of death by suicide.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I cannot wait to die"" - Yes, clear active desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I cannot wait to die"" (current strong desire).
    *   **Future ideation:** ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"" (planning for a future event, specifically death by suicide).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →

        *   Immediate timeline: No explicit ""tonight"" or ""right now"".
        *   *Decision:* The presence of explicit intent (""I cannot wait to die"") combined with concrete preparation (""ill fix all of the funeral costs"") fits the criteria for **Behavior**. The preparation for funeral costs is analogous to writing a note or acquiring means, as it shows a concrete step towards the act or its aftermath.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** No, because there is explicit active suicidal desire and preparation.
*   **Ideation:** No, because there is *preparation* (""ill fix all of the funeral costs""), which moves it beyond just desire into actionable planning.
*   **Behavior:** This fits. It has ""Explicit suicide intent"" (""I cannot wait to die"") and ""Preparation evidence"" (""ill fix all of the funeral costs""). While no specific method or immediate timeline is stated, the *preparation* is sufficient to classify it as Behavior according to the framework's definition: ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note"" – planning for funeral costs is a form of preparing for the event of death by suicide.
*   **Attempt:** No past action described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable (no attempt).
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not directly applicable as no immediate timeline, but the *preparation* is a strong indicator of intent to act.

    *   Emotional markers: ""life won't ever be as good again,"" ""destined to live a depressed life,"" ""can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past."" These strongly indicate hopelessness, despair, and a sense of irreversible loss.

    *   Passive experience: Not applicable.
    *   Rejection noted?: No rejection of suicidal thoughts, but crucially, no *active* suicidal thoughts are expressed to be rejected. The post is a lament about the quality of life, not a statement of suicidal intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: Describes past happiness and its end (""the summer of my life is over,"" ""everything that made my happiness has now left me"").

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No explicit suicide desire. The phrase ""what's really the point?"" expresses a lack of purpose and deep despair, but it does not explicitly state a *desire to die*. This is the critical distinction from Ideation.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post clearly expresses ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" (""life won't ever be as good again,"" ""destined to live a depressed life,"" ""what's really the point?""). There are ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire.""

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator**: ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" - This perfectly describes the post. ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" - This is also true. The post is a cry of despair and a questioning of life's value given perceived future suffering, but it stops short of expressing a wish to die.
*   **Ideation**: Requires ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"". This is not present in the post.

The phrase ""I will never die, I will never be free"" expresses profound hopelessness about the *inability* to escape pain/life, rather than an active desire to end life. It's about the *permanence of suffering*, not the *pursuit of death*.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This fits best. The post is filled with ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" (""suffer"", ""live in pain"", ""pain will never loosen its grip""). The phrase ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free"" can be interpreted as a metaphorical expression of profound hopelessness and despair, akin to ""want to disappear"" in its lack of active suicidal intent. There are NO expressions of active suicidal desire.

    **Category Definition Check:**
    *   **Indicator:** ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" - Present. ""Metaphorical death references ('want to disappear')"" - The ""never die, never be free"" phrase functions similarly, expressing an inability to escape current suffering.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" (writer's own past action). ""sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life"" (sister's past action - noted but writer-focused rule applies). ""losing two children to suicide"" (writer's parents' potential future).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""What's the point?"", ""welcome end to everything"", ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.""
    *   **Emotional markers:** Pain, doubt, hopelessness (""What's the point?"", ""why bother going through all of it?""), feeling things ""don't feel that far-fetched"" (regarding ending life).
    *   **Specific methods:** None for current intent.
    *   **Preparations:** None for current intent.
    *   **Past actions:** ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" (writer).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."" ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from."" These indicate active desire for death/suicide.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""Some days, it makes so little sense... But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched."" This shows fluctuating thoughts, but the ""like today"" part points to current active ideation.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** The post states a *reason not to act* (parents), but not an explicit rejection of the suicidal thoughts or desire itself. The desire for ""that state lasting forever"" is still present and ""hard to turn away from."" This is a protective factor, not a disavowal of the ideation.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" (writer's own past). Sister's past suicide.
    *   **Present intent:** ""like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."" ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from."" (Current ideation).
    *   **Future ideation:** ""why bother going through all of it?"" (General questioning of future existence).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** Yes. The writer explicitly states: ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" This directly matches the definition for ""Attempt"" (description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent, includes interrupted/aborted attempts).

    *   **IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
        1.  **Writer-focused:** The ""aborted attempt"" is by the writer.
        2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since a past attempt by the writer is clearly described, this category takes precedence over any current ideation.
        3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While there is current ideation, there is no immediate timeline or specific plan for *current* action. The past attempt rule is higher in hierarchy.
        4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The reason for not acting (parents) is an external deterrent, not an internal rejection of the suicidal desire. However, the presence of a past attempt overrides this consideration for the final classification.
        5.  **Output exactly one:** The presence of the writer's own past ""aborted attempt at suicide"" is the strongest and highest-priority signal according to the framework.

    *   **Final Category Decision:** Based on rule 4a and the temporal hierarchy, the classification is **Attempt**.

    *   **Emotional markers:** Disappointment, hopelessness, worthlessness (implied by ""nothing""), numbness, despair.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""in the tub, there will be less of a mess."" This strongly implies drowning or cutting wrists in the tub, chosen for a specific post-mortem consideration, making it a concrete method detail.
    *   **Preparations:** ""I plan on doing it"" (a statement of planning). The detail about ""less of a mess"" suggests forethought and preparation.
    *   **Past actions:** None described.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""I plan on doing it,"" ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best."" The writer clearly owns the intent and views it as a solution.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No rejection; rather, it's a justification and a farewell.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I plan on doing it"" indicates a current, active plan. The tone is conclusive and immediate, despite not stating ""tonight.""
    *   **Future ideation:** While the act itself is future, the *planning* and *intent* are present and concrete.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → Yes.
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** ""I plan on doing it"", ""its for the best.""
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** ""in the tub, there will be less of a mess"" (specific method/location chosen with a practical consideration), and ""I plan on doing it"" (preparation/planning).
        *   The combination of clear intent, a specific method/location, and the statement of planning (""I plan on doing it"") pushes this beyond mere ideation. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior notes that ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" Here we have clear intent *with* method details and planning, strongly implying immediacy and capability.

    *   This leads directly to **BEHAVIOR**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit active suicidal desire, specific method, and planning.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is a specific method (""in the tub"") and a statement of planning (""I plan on doing it""), not just a general wish to die or non-actionable methods.
*   **Behavior:** Fits perfectly. There is specific method stated (""in the tub"" for ""less of a mess""), and preparation evidence (""I plan on doing it""). The overall tone and farewell suggest imminent intent.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
3.  Immediacy trumps: The detailed plan and farewell imply immediate intent.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: None.
    *   Indirect death references: ""want the pain to go away"" is a desire for relief from suffering, not an explicit or indirect death reference in the context of suicide. It's more about distress.
    *   Emotional markers: ""pain"" (distress, suffering), ""Can someone just hug me please"" (seeking comfort, feeling overwhelmed).
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: No active suicidal desire is stated. The focus is on the pain itself and seeking comfort.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No suicidal thoughts are expressed, so no rejection is present.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? → No. There is no explicit suicide intent.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? → No. The post expresses a desire for pain to go away, which is not the same as an explicit wish to die (""want to die""). It's general distress.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? → Yes. The post expresses general unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair (""want the pain to go away"") and seeks comfort. There are NO expressions of active suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" - This fits perfectly. ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" - This is true for the post.
*   **Ideation:** Requires ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"". This is not present.
*   **Behavior:** Requires specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline. None present.
*   **Attempt:** Requires description of past concrete action. None present.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no higher categories are met.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable.
4.  Rejection downgrade: Not applicable as no suicidal thoughts to reject.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

    *   **Indirect death references:** ""shutting down"", ""when theyre gone.youre gone."" (referring to a support person)
    *   **Emotional markers:** Overwhelming despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, pain (physical and emotional). Examples: ""sick of being epileptic"", ""melancholic mind"", ""crippling depressive reaction"", ""miserably unfair"", ""absolute failure"", ""never deserved anything"", ""loneliness"", ""traumatized"", ""paralyzing fear of abandonment"".
    *   **Specific methods (for *current* intent):** None stated.
    *   **Preparations (for *current* intent):** None stated.
    *   **Past actions:** The post describes past self-harm/substance abuse: ""I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants... secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system...""
        *   **Crucial analysis for ""Attempt"":** The description of taking painkillers/paracetamol is framed as ""to cope with those racing thoughts"" and ""addiction,"" leading to physical damage. It does *not* explicitly state suicidal intent for *that specific action* (e.g., ""I took them to die"" or ""I overdosed to end it""). While severe, the stated purpose was coping/addiction, not a suicide attempt. Therefore, this past action does not meet the ""Attempt"" definition requiring ""suicidal intent"" for the action itself.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" and ""wanting to end it"" clearly indicate active, personal desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable, as intent is active.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No disavowal of the desire. The post details reasons *for* the desire.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** A significant portion of the post recounts past traumas, suffering, and coping mechanisms.
    *   **Present intent:** The opening ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it"" indicate a clear present desire/ideation.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future timing or plan is mentioned for the *current* intent to ""end it.""

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?**
        *   No. The past paracetamol use is described as coping/addiction leading to harm, not as an action taken with the intent to die. It does not meet the ""Attempt"" definition's requirement of ""suicidal intent"" for the specific action.

    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."").
        *   **Specific method:** No specific method is stated for this *current* intent.
        *   **Preparation:** No preparation is mentioned.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No immediate timeline (""tonight"", ""right now"").
        *   Therefore, it does not qualify as ""BEHAVIOR"".

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   **Explicit wish to die:** Yes (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."", ""wanting to end it"").
        *   **Non-actionable methods:** No specific method or plan.
        *   **No preparation or immediate timeline:** Confirmed above.
        *   This perfectly matches the definition of ""IDEATION"".

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
        *   No, because there is clear, active suicidal desire (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT.""). This rules out ""INDICATOR"".

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. The past self-harm is not classified as an ""Attempt"" due to the lack of explicit suicidal intent for that action. The current state is Ideation.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy is present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal thoughts is present.
5.  **Output exactly one:** One category will be output.

Based on the systematic analysis, the post clearly expresses active suicidal desire without a specific plan, method, or immediate timeline. The past self-harm, while severe, is not described as having suicidal intent, thus not qualifying as an ""Attempt.""

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""Trying to kill myself"", ""end my own life"", ""I'm going to try again"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""Nothing feels real"", ""guilty"", ""pain"", ""anger"", ""shame for failing"", ""fucking loser"", ""don't care"", ""Fuck me"". These indicate profound distress, hopelessness, worthlessness, and self-loathing.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of"". While not named (e.g., ""pills""), it describes a *type* of method, suggesting a shift in planning. ""my math is off"" implies calculation related to a method.
    *   **Preparations:** ""plenty of opportunities"" suggests readiness or scouting.
    *   **Past actions:** ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real."" ""I feel shame for failing."" ""I'm going to try again"". These clearly indicate a past suicide attempt that was unsuccessful.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real."" and ""I'm going to try again"" show clear, active intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** No rejection of the suicidal intent. The mention of ""survival instincts"" is a struggle *against* the act, but the overall intent to ""try again"" remains firm.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real."" ""I feel shame for failing."" -> Clear reference to a past attempt.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm going to try again"".
    *   **Future ideation:** ""I'm not sure exactly when, I think tommorow maybe. But I don't know. I have plenty of opportunities. Maybe tommorow, maybe next week, maybe next month, maybe next year."" This indicates an ongoing, but somewhat flexible, future plan. The ""tomorrow maybe"" suggests potential immediacy, but it's not firm.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** Yes. The phrases ""I feel shame for failing"" and ""I'm going to try again"" directly describe a past, unsuccessful suicide attempt. The definition of ""Attempt"" includes ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" and ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"". ""Failing"" clearly implies an attempt was made.

    *   **IRREDUCIBLE RULES check:**
        *   Rule 2: ""Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation"". Since a past suicide attempt is explicitly described, this rule dictates that ""Attempt"" is the highest applicable category, overriding any concurrent ideation or potential behavior.

    Even though there is current intent (""I'm going to try again"") and some elements of planning (different method, ""math is off"", ""plenty of opportunities"", ""tomorrow maybe""), the explicit mention of a *past failed attempt* is the most critical factor according to the provided hierarchy.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""courage to end it"" (direct expression of desire to end life).
    *   Indirect death references: ""It's over"" (could be metaphorical, but in context of ""end it"" suggests finality).
    *   Emotional markers: ""Satanic Groundhog day"", ""Brain really hurts"", ""No income"", ""Nothing to do"", ""hate everything"", ""No money will rot your brain"", ""in hell"" -> all indicate significant distress, hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness.
    *   Specific methods: None mentioned.
    *   Preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Past actions: No past suicide attempts described.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""All I want is courage to end it."" -> Yes, the writer actively states a desire for the courage to commit suicide.
    *   Passive experience: Not passive.
    *   Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal or rejection of the thought. The desire is presented as genuine.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No past attempts.
    *   Present intent: ""All I want is courage to end it."" -> This is a current desire.
    *   Future ideation: No specific future plan or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""). The desire for ""courage"" implies it's not currently active or planned for immediate execution.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

        *   Specific method/preparation: No.

        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""courage to end it"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no specific method or immediate timeline is provided.
        *   This matches **Ideation**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator**: Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation**: ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"". ""All I want is courage to end it"" fits this. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". This also fits.

*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** None.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""I have to make it stop."" This is an active statement of intent to cease the pain/existence. ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" shows a belief that their absence (death) would be beneficial, indicating a desire for that state.
*   **Passive experience:** No.

*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
    *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" and ""I have to make it stop"" strongly convey a desire for self-cessation. It's an active desire for their non-existence as a solution.
    *   Non-actionable methods: N/A (no method stated).
    *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Correct.
    *   *Result:* This aligns well with IDEATION.

*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
    *   No, it's more than *only* distress or metaphors. ""I have to make it stop"" is an active statement of intent to end something, strongly implying self-termination in context. ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" is a clear suicidal ideation. It's not a rejected thought.
    *   *Result:* Does not fit INDICATOR.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear, active desire for self-cessation (""make it stop"" in the context of ""happier without me"") as a solution to pain, without specifying a method, preparation, or immediate timeline. This fits the definition of Ideation.

The fear of *failure* or *consequences* (hospitalization, injury) is stated as the reason for *not acting*, but the underlying wish to die is still present and strong. This is not a ""rejection downgrade"" as per Rule 4 because the desire itself is not rejected.

The post expresses a clear, active desire for death and a belief that death would be better, but lacks a specific plan, method, or imminent timeline. The stated fear of ""botching it"" acts as a current barrier to action, preventing it from being classified as Behavior.

They also state, ""Of course I will wait till he's an adult,"" and ""11 more years then yes I could be there but for now...""

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Eliminates ATTEMPT)
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent is present (""I would say I'm suicidal"").

        *   Explicit suicide desire is present.
        *   There is no actionable plan or immediacy.
        *   However, the ""IRREDUCIBLE RULES"" must be applied: ""4. Rejection downgrade: 'I don't actually want to' → indicator"". The user's statement ""I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that."" is a clear rejection of *current* action, despite the underlying thoughts. This functionally acts as a ""I don't actually want to (act on it now)"" statement.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
        *   The post contains significant distress and explicit suicidal thoughts.
        *   Crucially, these suicidal thoughts are *rejected* for current action (""I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that.""). This aligns with the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" component of the Indicator definition and the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule. The user is articulating suicidal ideation but explicitly stating reasons why they *will not* act on it *currently*.

    Based on the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule, the explicit negation of current intent to act, despite the presence of suicidal thoughts, places this in the 'Indicator' category. The distant future ideation (""11 more years"") further supports the lack of current actionable intent.

    *   Explicit suicide references: ""I just want off this life."" - This is a direct expression of a desire to die.
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""Struggling to hold on,"" ""Been depressed and feeling like shit for years &amp; years."" - Indicates severe, chronic distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific methods: None mentioned.
    *   Preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Past actions: None mentioned regarding suicide attempts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I just want off this life"" - The writer actively owns this desire.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No disavowal or rejection of the thought.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""Been depressed... for years &amp; years"" describes a past/ongoing state of depression, not a past action.
    *   Present intent: ""I just want off this life"" expresses a current desire.
    *   Future ideation: No specific future timing, but the desire is present.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""I just want off this life"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (no ""tonight,"" ""right now,"" etc.).
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? → Yes. ""I just want off this life"" fits this perfectly. It's an explicit wish to die without a specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? → No, because there is explicit suicide desire.

**Category Definition Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out by ""I just want off this life"" (active suicidal desire).
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"" - ""want off this life"" fits this. ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"" - No method mentioned, so it's non-actionable. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" - This is true for the post. This matches perfectly.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of a past attempt.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as only one category fits.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as no immediacy is present.
4.  Rejection downgrade: Not applicable as no rejection is present.
5.  Output exactly one: Will do.

The post clearly expresses a desire to end life without detailing a specific plan, means, or immediate intent. This falls squarely into the 'Ideation' category.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I need to kill myself"", ""me killing myself""
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""life just isn't worth it""
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""completely failing school"", ""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore"", ""terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends"" (hopelessness, anhedonia, fear of consequences for others).

    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I need to kill myself"" – Yes, the writer explicitly states their desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The statement ""but I'm terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends"" indicates a *conflict* or *fear of consequences for others*, but it is *not* an explicit disavowal or rejection of the *desire* to die. The core ""I need to kill myself"" remains active. This is not a ""but I won't do it"" or ""my brain tells me but I don't want to"" scenario.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.

        *   Immediate timeline: No (no ""tonight"", ""right now"", ""this weekend"").
        *   *Critical expansion for Behavior*: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" The post does not have this level of immediacy. The question about minimizing harm to family suggests a cognitive process around the *consequences* of the act, not necessarily an imminent action.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes (""I need to kill myself"").
        *   Non-actionable methods: Not applicable (no method mentioned at all).
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes, this fits.
        *   *Key boundary*: ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"". This is not present.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is explicit active suicidal desire.

    **Final Check against Definitions:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is active suicidal desire (""I need to kill myself""), not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. There is an explicit wish to die (""I need to kill myself"") without a specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. The conflict/fear for family does not negate the active desire, nor does it constitute a rejection that would downgrade it to Indicator.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline (""tonight"", ""right now"").
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past action is described.

    **Irreducible Rules Application:**
    1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
    2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as only present desire is discussed.
    3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.
    4.  Rejection downgrade: The fear of hurting family is not a rejection of the *desire* to die, so no downgrade.
    5.  Output exactly one.

The post clearly expresses an active suicidal desire without the elements of capability (specific method/preparation) or immediacy required for ""Behavior"". The presence of conflict/fear for family does not negate the active desire to die.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""By this time next week I'll be gone."" This is a strong, albeit indirect, reference to ending one's life. ""No point in trying anymore.""
*   **Indirect death references:** ""I'll be gone"" implies cessation of existence. ""My own body has given up on itself.""
*   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness (""no possible way to turn my life around"", ""no point in trying anymore"", ""can't escape""), weariness (""so tired of fighting"").
*   **Specific methods:** None.

*   **Passive experience:** Not passive.
*   **Rejection noted?** No rejection or disavowal of the thoughts.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

*   **Future ideation:** ""By this time next week I'll be gone."" This is a specific and imminent future timeline (within a week).

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" strongly implies an active desire to end their life, especially in context of ""no point in trying anymore.""
    *   **Immediate timeline:** ""By this time next week"" is a specific and imminent timeline. This aligns with the ""Behavior"" definition's ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'."" ""By this time next week"" falls within a similar timeframe as ""this weekend"" for immediacy.
    *   *Critical expansion*: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" is an expression of immediate intent to cease existing.

*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No, because there *is* immediacy.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear intent and immediacy.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit intent and imminent timeline.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is an imminent timeline. The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation states: ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"". ""By this time next week"" functions similarly as an imminent timeframe.
*   **Behavior:** This fits because there is an explicit expression of intent (""I'll be gone"") coupled with an imminent timeline (""By this time next week""). No specific method or preparation is needed when immediacy is present, as per the ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.

    *   **Future ideation:** ""I hope I don't make it"" suggests future-oriented ideation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **Start here →**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** Yes, the phrase ""another attempt"" directly indicates a past suicide attempt.
        *   According to the ""Attempt"" definition: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"", ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"", ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned"". The presence of a past attempt is the dominant factor.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes, all statements are about the writer's experiences and desires.
*   **Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation.** The explicit mention of a past ""attempt"" takes precedence over the present ideation (""I just want to die"").
*   **Immediacy trumps:** No immediate timeline for a new action is mentioned.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal thoughts.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post explicitly refers to a past suicide attempt (""another attempt""). According to the framework's ""Attempt"" definition and the ""Temporal hierarchy"" rule (Attempt > Behavior > Ideation), any description of a past attempt immediately classifies the post as 'attempt', overriding concurrent ideation.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""death is the only escape"" implies an active endorsement of death as a solution to suffering. While ""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"" could suggest intrusive thoughts, the concluding statement ""death is the only escape"" indicates acceptance of these thoughts as a valid path.
    *   Passive experience: ""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"" initially sounds passive, but the subsequent ""death is the only escape"" shifts it to active desire.

**Clarification Check:**
*   **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The phrase ""death is the only escape"" is an active statement of desire for death as a solution, not merely a metaphorical expression or a rejected thought. This pushes it beyond 'Indicator'.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit.

*   **Emotional markers:** ""struggle to not think about"", ""genuinely bothered me afterwards"", ""struggle to categorize"", ""weighing on me"", ""bothering me"". Indicates distress, rumination, and seeking clarity.
*   **Specific methods:** Not explicitly stated, but ""testing my method"" implies a specific one was used.
*   **Preparations:** ""went in with the intention of dying"" implies mental preparation and possibly physical setup for the method.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** For the second event, the writer states, ""I went in with the intention of dying."" This is clear active suicidal intent.
*   **Passive experience:** Not present.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** For the first event, the intent was ""testing,"" not dying. For the second, the action was ""stopped myself,"" indicating an *interrupted* action, but the *intention* to die was present at the outset of the action. This is not a rejection of the desire to die, but a failure to complete the action.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** The entire post discusses events that ""happened long enough ago"" and ""in the past year or two.""
*   **Present intent:** ""I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me."" No present suicidal intent is expressed.
*   **Future ideation:** Not present.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
    *   Let's evaluate the two described events against the 'Attempt' definition: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent. Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped').""
    *   **Event 1:** ""I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped."" While a physical action was taken, the stated intent was ""testing,"" not dying. This is ambiguous regarding ""suicidal intent"" for the *completion* of the act. However, it's a concrete action towards self-harm.
    *   **Event 2:** ""I went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself.""
        *   **Intent:** ""intention of dying"" - clearly suicidal intent.
        *   **Action:** ""went in"" (implying initiating the method) and ""stopped myself"" - this perfectly fits the ""interrupted/aborted attempts"" part of the definition.
    *   Since Event 2 unequivocally describes an interrupted attempt with suicidal intent, the answer to (a) is YES.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** All descriptions are of the writer's own actions.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation:** An attempt is described, so this category takes precedence.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as the events are past.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** For Event 2, the action was stopped due to lack of courage, but the *intention* was to die. This is an interrupted attempt, not a rejection of the underlying suicidal desire.
5.  **Output exactly one:** The classification will be 'attempt'.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post describes a past event where the writer ""went in with the intention of dying"" but ""stopped myself."" This precisely matches the definition of an 'Attempt' which includes ""interrupted/aborted attempts"" where there was ""actual self-harm with suicidal intent."" The presence of this past action, despite the writer's own struggle to categorize it, places the post in the 'Attempt' category according to the provided framework.

Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""contemplating suicide"", ""looking up how to do it"", ""wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself so this nightmare could all be over""
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""this nightmare could all be over"" (implying ending life)
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""depression ruined"", ""fucking hell"", ""destroys any hope"", ""never ending pit"", ""mostly terrible teachers"", ""nightmare"" - indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and suffering.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""jump in front of a car"", ""stab myself""
    *   **Preparations:** ""looking up how to do it"" (this is a concrete step towards action/researching means)
    *   **Past actions:** None described.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself"" is an active expression of desire to die by specific means. The ""wish I had the courage"" indicates a barrier to action, but not a rejection of the underlying suicidal desire. The desire is present and active.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not presented as intrusive or passive.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal (""but I won't do it""). The statement about courage is a perceived limitation, not a rejection of the suicidal intent itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""contemplating suicide"" (ongoing past/present), ""looking up how to do it"" (ongoing past/present).
    *   **Present intent:** No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"").
    *   **Future ideation:** The ""wish I had the courage"" points to a desired future action, contingent on overcoming a personal barrier.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Rule: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation)
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""I wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself"". This is a clear desire to die.
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""jump in front of a car"", ""stab myself"".
        *   **Preparation evidence:** Yes, ""looking up how to do it"" is a form of preparation/research into means.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No.

    The presence of explicit suicide intent, specific methods, and preparatory action (""looking up how to do it"") aligns with the definition of **Behavior**. While there's no immediate timeline, the combination of specific methods and preparatory steps is sufficient for this category. The ""wish I had the courage"" indicates a desire to act, not a rejection of the suicidal thoughts, and it does not negate the specific methods or the preparatory research.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes, all statements are about the writer.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** No immediate timeline, but the other criteria for Behavior are met.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** No explicit rejection (""I don't actually want to"") is present. The ""wish I had the courage"" is a statement about a barrier, not a disavowal of the desire.

Based on the framework, particularly the presence of explicit intent, specific methods, and preparatory actions (""looking up how to do it""), the post falls into the Behavior category.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back,"" ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all,"" ""If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace.""

    *   **Specific methods:** ""nuclear bomb"" (mentioned as a generalized wish for collective death, not a personal suicide method).
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back."" These are active expressions of a desire to cease existing. The wish for a nuclear bomb is also an active endorsement of an end to life, albeit collective.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal of the desire to ""not be here"" or ""leave.""

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad.""
    *   **Future ideation:** ""I want to leave and never come back,"" ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all."" (Non-specific timing for personal action; collective wish for future).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent is present (""I don't want to be here anymore"").
        *   Specific method: ""nuclear bomb"" is mentioned, but it's a wish for *collective* death, not a *personal* method the user intends to employ for *their own* suicide. It does not indicate capability or a personal plan.
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   Therefore, it does not qualify as BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back.""
        *   Non-actionable methods: The ""nuclear bomb"" wish is non-actionable by the individual for their own suicide.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes.
        *   This path fits the criteria for IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there are clear expressions of active desire to cease existing, not just distress or rejected thoughts.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are active expressions of suicidal desire (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad"").
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. There's an explicit wish to die/cease existence, no actionable personal plan or method, and no immediate timeline. The ""nuclear bomb"" wish is a generalized desire for an end to suffering through death, but not a personal, actionable suicide plan.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of a specific personal method, preparation, or imminent timeline for self-harm.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempt is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt or behavior is present.
3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy in the post.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection of the desire to ""not be here.""
5.  Output exactly one: Will do.

The post clearly expresses a desire to not exist and to ""leave"" life, without detailing a specific personal plan, means, or immediate intent to act. The ""nuclear bomb"" wish is a generalized death wish for humanity, not a personal suicide plan. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""I want to die"", ""after I die""
    *   Indirect death references: N/A
    *   Emotional markers: ""so much pressure"" (indicating distress, hopelessness)
    *   Specific methods: ""pull the trigger"" (firearm)
    *   Preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Past actions: None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I want to die"", ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" - Yes, clear active intent and ownership.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" - This indicates a current decision or readiness to act, even if not tied to a specific hour. It's not a future ""someday.""
    *   Future ideation: No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""I want to die"", ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"").
        *   Specific method: Yes (""pull the trigger"").
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: While not explicitly ""tonight"" or ""now,"" the phrase ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" strongly implies a current, decided intent and readiness to act, which moves it beyond mere ideation and into the realm of capability and active intent. The presence of a specific, lethal method reinforces this.

    *   **Evaluation against definitions:**
        *   **Indicator:** No, because there is active suicidal desire and a specific method, not just distress or rejected thoughts.
        *   **Ideation:** No, because it goes beyond a mere wish to die. It includes a specific method (""pull the trigger"") and a statement of active intent to perform that action (""I'm just going to""). This is more than ""no preparation or immediate timeline"" for ideation.
        *   **Behavior:** Yes. It meets ""Intent + Capability"". It states a ""Specific method"" (""pull the trigger"") and expresses an active intention to use it (""I'm just going to""). While not explicitly ""tonight,"" the phrasing ""I'm just going to"" suggests a current decision and readiness to act, which aligns with the spirit of ""Behavior"" as intent coupled with capability. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior notes that ""Expressions of immediate intent... qualify even without method details."" Here we have method details *and* an expression of current intent to act.
        *   **Attempt:** No, it describes future intent, not a past action.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
        2.  Temporal hierarchy: N/A (no attempt mentioned).
        3.  Immediacy trumps: The ""I'm just going to"" combined with a specific method is strong enough to classify as Behavior.
        4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection.
        5.  Output exactly one: Will be 'behavior'.

The presence of a specific method (""pull the trigger"") combined with the active intent (""I'm just going to"") elevates this from Ideation to Behavior, indicating a higher level of risk due to the stated capability and current decision to act.

    *   **Future ideation:** None explicitly stated as a future *action*.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) **Any past suicide attempt described?** → Yes. The post states, ""I hurt myself two months ago"" and mentions ""my forearms with my wounds are visible."" While ""hurt myself"" isn't explicitly ""tried to kill myself,"" the context of the entire post, especially the current explicit suicidal ideation (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""), strongly implies that this past self-harm was a manifestation of suicidal distress or intent. The framework's definition for ""Attempt"" includes ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" and the clarification ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt. Given the severity of the distress and the current ideation, this past self-harm should be classified as an attempt.
    *   **IRREDUCIBLE RULES:** Rule 2: ""Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation."" Since a past attempt is described, it takes precedence over the current ideation.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""the more suicidal I get"", ""conversations with myself about suicide in that journal"", ""I think about suicide every day"", ""seriously consider it"".

    *   **Emotional markers:** ""want help and to get better"", ""can't tell anyone"", ""alone"", ""sad all the time"", ""too much to carry alone"", ""worried I would go to hell"", ""can't afford that"", ""too much"". These indicate significant distress, isolation, and hopelessness.

    *   **Past actions:** ""it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone."" No past *attempt* described.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The user actively thinks about suicide (""I think about suicide every day"", ""seriously consider it"").
    *   **Passive experience:** Not explicitly stated as intrusive, but as a growing state (""the more suicidal I get"").
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** YES. ""But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did."" This is a crucial explicit rejection of acting on the thoughts/plans.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""it's been like this for seven years"" (duration of feelings, not an attempt).
    *   **Present intent:** ""the more suicidal I get"", ""I write detailed plans in my journal"", ""I think about suicide every day"". These are ongoing present actions/thoughts.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""But I know I would never do it"" (future rejection).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The post describes ongoing feelings and thoughts, but no past action.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   There is explicit suicide intent (""I think about suicide every day"", ""seriously consider it"").
        *   There is ""preparation evidence"" (""I write detailed plans in my journal""). This would typically point to **Behavior**.
        *   However, we must apply the Irreducible Rules, especially Rule 4: ""Rejection downgrade: ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator.""
        *   The statement ""But I know I would never do it"" is a clear and explicit rejection of acting on the suicidal thoughts/plans. While the plans exist, the stated intent is *not* to carry them out. The definition of Behavior requires ""Intent + Capability"". If the intent to act is explicitly disavowed, the ""Intent"" component for Behavior is negated.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** This would be Ideation, but the presence of ""detailed plans"" moves it beyond simple ideation *unless* it's downgraded by rejection.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
        *   The post contains significant distress.
        *   It contains thoughts about suicide and even plans, but these are explicitly *rejected* by the statement ""But I know I would never do it"".
        *   The ""Indicator"" definition includes: ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts (""brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to"")"". The user's statement ""I know I would never do it"" fits this criterion.

    **Conclusion based on Irreducible Rule 4:** Despite the alarming presence of ""detailed plans,"" the explicit and strong rejection (""But I know I would never do it"") overrides other elements and downgrades the classification to **Indicator** according to the provided framework's rules. The plans exist, but the stated intent is not to act on them.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

    *   **Passive experience:** No.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, the post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide"" and expresses a perceived capability, going far beyond general distress or rejected thoughts.

**Final Check against Category Definitions and Irreducible Rules:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicide reference and active contemplation.
*   **Ideation:** Fits ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan."" ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide"" is a strong form of active suicidal desire/contemplation. It lacks the specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline to be Behavior.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes no past action.

The phrase ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide"" is a clear expression of active suicidal thought, even if it's about the *potential* or *capability* to act, rather than an immediate plan. It's more than just a general wish to die; it's a specific contemplation of the act itself. This aligns best with Ideation.

    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""just want tit to be over"" (interpreted as wanting life to end).

        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, ""just want tit to be over"" and ""I wasn't to be down"" (interpreted as 'done' or 'gone') strongly indicate an explicit wish for life to end.
        *   Non-actionable methods: No specific method is mentioned, but the desire is present without a concrete plan.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Correct.
        *   This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This post contains more than *only* distress or metaphors; it contains an active desire for an end to life. There are no rejected thoughts.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** This post goes beyond general distress. It expresses an active desire for things to ""be over,"" which, in context, points to an end of life, not just metaphorical disappearance. There are no rejected thoughts.
*   **Ideation:** The phrases ""just want tit to be over"" and ""I wasn't to be down"" (interpreted as 'done'/'gone') signify an explicit wish for life to end. There is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline mentioned. This aligns perfectly with the Ideation definition.
*   **Behavior:** Lacks specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Lacks description of a past concrete action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt or behavior is present.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as no immediacy is present.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output one.

The post clearly expresses an active desire for life to end (""just want tit to be over,"" ""I wasn't to be down"") without specifying a method, preparation, or immediate timeline. This places it in the Ideation category.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""how to accomplish death"", ""shooting myself"", ""failed suicide"". The phrase ""End it now"" is used in a general sense but reflects the underlying desire.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""my body is continuously accompanied by death"" (though clarified as health issues, not immediate death).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""in hell"", ""so alone"", ""insane abandonment issues"", ""painful feeling of inability to connect"", ""sadder"", ""terribly scared"", ""pain"", ""depression"", ""high anxiety"". Strong sense of hopelessness: ""no hope for salvation"", ""help that isn't coming"", ""things tend to get worse"", ""no miracle is coming"", ""It doesn't get better"".
    *   **Specific methods:** ""shotgun"", ""handguns"", ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth"", ""overdosing"" (discussed in context of failed attempts/consequences). The writer is actively *deliberating* between these methods.
    *   **Preparations:** ""I've looked into other options"". The detailed consideration of specific methods (caliber, entry point, consequences of failure) indicates active research and planning/preparation. ""I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"" implies a desire to find a way.
    *   **Past actions:** None by the writer.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer explicitly states ""I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death,"" indicating an active desire to die, coupled with a fear of the *process* or *failure*. The detailed discussion of methods (""I don't want my head to explode via shotgun..."", ""But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand..."") shows active engagement with the *means* of suicide.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal of the desire to die. The fear expressed is about the *method* or *failure*, not a rejection of the suicidal intent itself. ""A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate"" reinforces the desire for a successful death.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No past attempts by the writer.
    *   **Present intent:** The post expresses a current state of intense suffering and a clear, active engagement with the *means* of suicide. The deliberation over methods (""I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death,"" ""I've looked into other options,"" detailed gun discussions) indicates a *current* focus on how to achieve death.
    *   **Future ideation:** While no explicit ""tonight"" or ""now"" is stated for an *action*, the detailed exploration of methods and research (""looked into other options"") points towards a future action, but the *planning/research phase* is happening *now*.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death.""
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""shotgun,"" ""handguns,"" ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth."" These are specific, actionable methods being considered.
        *   **Preparation evidence:** Yes, ""I've looked into other options."" The detailed internal deliberation about methods (caliber, entry point, consequences of failure) also constitutes active research and planning, which is a form of preparation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No explicit immediate timeline for action, but the presence of specific methods and preparation overrides the lack of immediate timeline for classification into 'Behavior'. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" Conversely, detailed method/preparation can qualify without explicit immediacy.

    This post goes beyond mere ""Ideation"" because it involves detailed consideration of *specific methods* and active *research/preparation* (""looked into other options""). It's not just a wish to die, but an active engagement with the *how* and *means*.

    **IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
    1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all ""I"" statements.
    2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No attempt. The detailed method discussion and research (""looked into other options"") places it above Ideation.
    3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No explicit immediate timeline for action, but the detailed method discussion and preparation are strong indicators for 'Behavior'.
    4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal intent. The fear is of failure or painful methods, not of the desire to die.
    5.  **Output exactly one:** Yes.

    Based on the detailed discussion of specific methods and evidence of research/preparation (""looked into other options""), the post falls under the **Behavior** category.

    *   Non-actionable methods: No specific method, which fits.
    *   No preparation or immediate timeline: This is true.
    *   This strongly points to **IDEATION**.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
    *   While there is distress (""Can't do any of it!"", ""don't want this anymore"") and a metaphorical phrasing (""sleep and never ever wake up""), the core of ""never ever wake up"" is an active desire for death/non-existence. The ""Indicator"" category specifies ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire."" Since there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire (even if indirect/metaphorical), it goes beyond Indicator. It's not a rejected thought.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** N/A (no attempt/behavior).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I want to die"" clearly indicates active endorsement of suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** ""but I'm scared"" indicates ambivalence and fear, but it is not an explicit disavowal or rejection of the *desire* to die (e.g., it's not ""I don't actually want to die""). The desire is still present. The request for ""help me work out what to do"" also suggests a cry for help and ambivalence, rather than a full rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I want to die"" (present desire). No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").

        *   No, because ""I want to die"" is an explicit expression of active suicidal desire, not just distress, metaphor, or a fully rejected thought. The ""but I'm scared"" is ambivalence, not a rejection that would downgrade it to Indicator per the rule (""I don't actually want to"").

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes, all analysis is on the writer's statements.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt/behavior is present.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** The phrase ""but I'm scared"" does not meet the specific condition for downgrade (""I don't actually want to""). The desire to die is still explicitly stated.
*   **Output exactly one:** Will output one category.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post explicitly states ""I want to die,"" which is an active suicidal desire. However, it does not include a specific method, preparation, or an imminent timeline. The phrase ""but I'm scared"" indicates ambivalence but does not negate the explicit desire to die, thus it does not fall under the ""rejection downgrade"" rule for 'Indicator'. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

The ""Tuesday"" is a specific, albeit not immediate, timeline for the logistical part of the plan.

    *   This fits the **Behavior** category:
        *   ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"" - While not named, ""I know how"" and ""I know where I'll attempt"" strongly imply a specific method and location are known to the individual.
        *   ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note"" - ""I have a plan"", ""I know what I need"", ""I know how and when I can run away from home"" are all strong indicators of preparation.
        *   ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"" - ""It must be a Tuesday to run away"" is a specific future timeline for the *action* or its critical preparatory step, moving it beyond general ideation.

    *   The ambivalence (""idk if I should do it"") does not downgrade it to Indicator because the detailed plan and active intent are present. It's not a rejection.

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out?

The phrase ""fight the urge to go wandering off into the night"" indicates resisting an urge, but it's not a rejection of the desire to die, and the context (""I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now"") suggests indifference to harm.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Mentions past emotional abuse, but no past suicide attempts.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I want to die"", ""I want to not exist"", ""I do not want to exist anymore"" are present desires. ""I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now"" indicates a present state of indifference to self-preservation. ""fight the urge to go wandering off into the night"" indicates a present urge for a risky action, but not a direct suicidal plan.
    *   **Future ideation:** None explicitly.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""want to die"", ""want to not exist"").
        *   Specific method: No.
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No explicit ""tonight"", ""right now"", ""this weekend"" directly tied to *suicide action*.
            *   ""I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now"" is an attitude of indifference, not an imminent plan for suicide.
            *   ""fight the urge to go wandering off into the night"" describes an urge for a risky action (wandering), not a direct, specific, or imminent plan for suicide. While wandering at night could be dangerous, the post does not state it as a method of suicide or an explicit suicidal action.
        *   *Critical expansion*: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" This is not present. The desire to ""be done"" or ""not exist"" is strong, but the post lacks the direct, actionable immediacy required for 'Behavior'.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes (""want to die"", ""want to not exist"", ""I want to disappear"").
        *   Non-actionable methods: The desire to ""disappear"" or ""not exist"" fits here.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes, there is no specific plan, method, or imminent timeline for *suicide itself*.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because there are explicit active suicidal desires (""want to die"", ""want to not exist"").

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear, active expressions of suicidal desire (""want to die"", ""want to not exist"") but lacks any stated specific method, preparation, or an explicit imminent timeline for a suicidal act. The mentions of indifference to harm and fighting an urge to wander are concerning but do not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as they are not direct, actionable suicide plans or imminent intents.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""ideations of suicide"", ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive"", ""Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it"", ""people/the world would be better off without me.""
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""battling to stay alive"" (implies a struggle against dying).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""tired of everything"", ""severely depressed"", ""shitty person"", ""shame"", ""emotionally unstable"", ""anxious"", ""isolated"", ""alone"", ""painful"", ""impossible"", ""drag"". All indicate hopelessness, worthlessness, and unbearable pain.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None. No mention of ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" suicide.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer states ""The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide."" and ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive."" These are active expressions of desire for death/non-existence.
    *   **Passive experience:** The phrase ""ideations of suicide"" might sound passive, but finding ""comfort"" in them suggests endorsement.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** No explicit disavowal. The writer mentions ""battling to stay alive,"" which indicates a struggle, but not a rejection of the desire to die. The reason for not telling the therapist is fear of consequences (police), not a disavowal of the suicidal thoughts themselves.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes historical depression and past difficulties as context for current feelings. No past *suicide attempts*.
    *   **Present intent:** ""Everyday I feel like..."", ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive."" These are ongoing present desires. No immediate timeline for *action* (e.g., ""doing it tonight"").
    *   **Future ideation:** ""I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't."" This indicates hopelessness about the future, but not a future *plan* for suicide.

        *   Non-actionable methods: No specific method mentioned.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Correct.
        *   *Conclusion:* This fits the criteria for IDEATION.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear active suicidal desire, not just distress or rejected thoughts. The ""battling to stay alive"" indicates a struggle but doesn't negate the active desire for non-existence.

**Final Classification based on Definitions:**
The post contains clear ""Explicit wish to die"" (""wish I wasn't alive"", ""ideations of suicide"") and expressions like ""people/the world would be better off without me,"" indicating active suicidal desire. However, it lacks any ""Specific method stated,"" ""Preparation evidence,"" or ""Imminent timeline."" Therefore, it falls under **Ideation**.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The phrase ""thinking about killing myself"" indicates an active mental engagement with the idea. It is not presented as an intrusive thought that is rejected.
*   **Passive experience:** Not passive.
*   **Rejection noted?** The statement ""If I had just one friend I wouldn't be thinking about killing myself"" is a *conditional* statement about what would *prevent* the thought, not an explicit disavowal or rejection of the thought *as it currently exists*. There is no ""but I won't do it"" or ""I don't actually want to"".

        *   This fits **IDEATION**.

**Check against Category Definitions and Irreducible Rules:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire (""thinking about killing myself""), and it's not explicitly rejected. The conditional statement (""If I had..."") does not equate to a rejection.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"" - ""thinking about killing myself"" is a clear form of this. ""No preparation or immediate timeline."" This is true.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.

**Irreducible Rules check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: N/A (only one type of thought).
3.  Immediacy trumps: N/A (no immediacy).
4.  Rejection downgrade: The conditional ""If I had just one friend I wouldn't be thinking about killing myself"" is *not* an explicit rejection of the current thought, but rather a statement about what would *stop* the thought. The thought is still present and acknowledged. Therefore, it does not downgrade to Indicator.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""want the constant anxiety and sadness...to stop by crashing into another car"" (clear intent to end suffering via a lethal act). ""afraid that I won't die on impact"" (explicit fear of *not* dying, confirming the desire to die).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""crashing into another car"" with the goal to ""stop"" the pain, implying death as the means.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""constant anxiety and sadness,"" ""pointless situation,"" ""afraid."" Indicates hopelessness and unbearable pain.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""crashing into another car.""
    *   **Preparations/Past Actions:** ""frequently come close to doing it"" describes repeated near-actions or aborted attempts (though not a full attempt as ""never can"" is stated). This indicates a repeated engagement with the specific method.
    *   **Past actions:** ""frequently come close to doing it"" describes repeated instances of nearly executing the plan. This is not a full attempt, but it's more than just ideation.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I want the constant anxiety and sadness...to stop by crashing into another car."" This is a clear, active desire for self-inflicted death.
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""but never can because I'm afraid that I won't die on impact and that I'll just end up with pain that doesn't kill me."" This is a fear of *failure* and *more pain*, not a rejection or disavowal of the suicidal desire itself. The desire to die is still present and active. Therefore, the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule does not apply.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""frequently come close to doing it"" describes repeated past near-actions.
    *   **Present intent:** The desire (""I want...to stop"") is presented as current and ongoing. The fear (""I'm afraid"") is also current.
    *   **Future ideation:** The desire is continuous.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The post states ""never can,"" meaning a full attempt was not made.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""I want...to stop by crashing into another car.""
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""crashing into another car.""
        *   **Preparation/Immediacy:** While there's no explicit ""tonight"" or ""now,"" the phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" indicates repeated, active engagement with the specific method. This goes beyond mere ideation; it describes repeated instances of nearly carrying out the act. This repeated proximity to the act, even if aborted due to fear of failure, demonstrates a high level of intent and capability, aligning with the ""Behavior"" category. The fear is of *failure*, not a rejection of the desire to die.

    *   **Comparison with Ideation:** Ideation implies ""no preparation or immediate timeline."" This post describes repeated ""coming close"" to the act, which is a form of active engagement with the method, making it more than just ideation.
    *   **Comparison with Behavior:** Behavior includes ""Specific method stated"" and ""Preparation evidence."" While ""frequently come close"" isn't ""preparation"" in the sense of acquiring means, it's repeated engagement with the *act* itself, demonstrating capability and proximity to execution. This aligns with the spirit of the Behavior category, indicating a higher level of risk than pure ideation.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all analysis is on the writer's actions/thoughts.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable here, as no full attempt was made.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No explicit immediate timeline, but ""frequently come close"" implies repeated near-imminent actions.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No, the fear is of failure, not a rejection of the desire to die.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

**Conclusion:** The presence of explicit suicidal intent, a specific method, and repeated near-actions (""frequently come close to doing it"") which are only stopped by fear of failure (not a change of mind about wanting to die) elevates this beyond Ideation. It demonstrates a level of capability and active engagement with the suicidal act that fits the ""Behavior"" category.

    *   Rejection noted? **YES.** ""Like, I won't commit"" is an explicit disavowal of suicidal intent/action. The subsequent ""if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome"" refers to a hypothetical *accidental* death, not self-inflicted death.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

    *   **Immediacy:** While starvation is a slow process, the *decision to begin* and the *action of stopping eating* are immediate and current. The post describes an active, initiated plan to end life.

This clearly fits the criteria for **Behavior**: ""Specific method stated... Preparation evidence... Expressions of immediate intent."" The initial rejection of ""kill myself"" is superseded by an active, chosen, and initiated method of self-destruction.

293,"Here's the deal. I'm not ok. I haven't been ok for a very long time. Some days are better than others, but for the most part, my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart with a center warm to the touch. In my past I've had everything that made me who I am stripped away from my character time and time again. It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do. Life on this planet is never easy, and there will always be people who've had it worse than me and made it out alive. But for now, in this moment as I write this, all I feel is that somber loneliness I've come to befriend over the last few months, but I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️",0,indicator,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** None.
*   **Indirect death references:** ""wish to be gone"" (qualified). ""my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart"" (metaphorical).
*   **Emotional markers:** ""not ok"", ""cold, broken heart"", ""dragged my face through the muds of life"", ""confused and terrified"", ""somber loneliness"". These indicate significant distress, despair, and pain.
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** Descriptions of past suffering and trauma (""stripped away from my character"", ""dragged my face through the muds of life"", ""experiencing some of the worst things""). *Crucially, no past suicide attempt is described.*

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is key. It explicitly qualifies and partially rejects a constant desire to be gone. The ending ""I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️"" indicates a plea for connection and support, not an active endorsement of suicide. The statement ""and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is"" further indicates a recognition of life's value and resilience.
*   **Passive experience:** The feelings of loneliness and confusion are presented as current experiences.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** Yes, ""I don't always wish to be gone"" serves as a partial rejection or strong qualification of the ""wish to be gone."" The overall tone and the ending plea for connection also disavow active suicide intent.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** Describes past suffering/trauma, but no past suicide *attempt*.
*   **Present intent:** No present suicide intent. The present focus is on feeling ""somber loneliness"" and hoping not to be alone.
*   **Future ideation:** The ""wish to be gone"" is the closest, but it's qualified and not presented as a concrete future desire for suicide.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. (Past suffering, not attempt.)
*   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. No explicit intent, method, or timeline.
*   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. While ""wish to be gone"" is mentioned, it's immediately qualified by ""I don't *always* wish to be gone,"" and the overall context emphasizes distress and seeking connection rather than a clear, active desire to die. This falls under the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule.
*   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post is rich with general unhappiness, hopelessness, despair, and confusion. The ""wish to be gone"" is presented as a thought that is not constant (""I don't *always* wish to be gone""), aligning with ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" within the Indicator definition. The ending is a plea for connection.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt/behavior/strong ideation.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** ""I don't always wish to be gone"" acts as a clear qualification/partial rejection of the desire to be gone, fitting the criteria for an 'Indicator'. The overall sentiment is distress and a plea for support.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'indicator'.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post expresses significant emotional distress, loneliness, and confusion. While it includes the phrase ""wish to be gone,"" this is immediately qualified by ""I don't *always* wish to be gone,"" and the writer also acknowledges the preciousness of life (""I know how precious that is, and yet somehow I'm still standing""). The concluding remarks (""I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️"") are a clear plea for connection and support, not an expression of active suicidal intent. This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' category's description of general unhappiness, despair, and rejected/qualified thoughts of death without active suicidal desire.

    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I'm depressed constantly, suicidal, and lonely."" - The writer explicitly states being ""suicidal."" The phrase ""hurting to delay the pain my death will cause"" indicates active consideration of their own death, even if delayed.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal. The ""delay"" is for others' sake, not a rejection of the suicidal thoughts themselves.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm suicidal"" indicates a current state of mind. The ""delay"" suggests current contemplation but no immediate action.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""my death will cause"" is future-oriented, but non-specific regarding timing or action.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **Start here →**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? →** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""suicidal"", ""my death"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No. The phrase ""delay the pain my death will cause"" explicitly indicates a *lack* of immediacy.
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →**
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""suicidal"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no method, no preparation, and the ""delay"" indicates non-immediacy.
        *   This aligns with **IDEATION**.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts →** No, there is explicit suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *are* expressions of active suicidal desire (""suicidal"").
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'I'm suicidal'"". ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" (the ""delay"" confirms non-immediacy).
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline. The ""delay"" contradicts immediacy.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as only one category is indicated.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable, as there is no immediacy; in fact, there's a stated delay.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable, no explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? Yes. The post is filled with distress (""hopelessness"", ""desperate"", ""no hope""), and crucially includes a direct rejection of suicidal desire (""i just don't want to die""). This fits the definition of Indicator.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt. The present rejection (""i just don't want to die"") takes precedence over the past desire.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator. This rule is directly applicable and decisive here. The phrase ""i just don't want to die"" is a clear rejection of current suicidal intent.
*   **Output exactly one:** Will do.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post clearly expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed. It mentions past suicidal ideation (""I wanted to die when I made that post""). However, the crucial element is the explicit disavowal of current suicidal desire: ""i just don't want to die."" This statement, according to the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule and the definition of 'Indicator' (which includes rejected/intrusive thoughts and general distress without active suicidal desire), places the post in the Indicator category. There is no current active intent, plan, or immediate timeline for suicide.

I don't know anyone who has the same interests. I'm ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point."" (active, present tense)
*   **Indirect death references:** ""I'm ready to say goodbye""
*   **Emotional markers:** ""feel like shit"", ""pretty much a failure"", ""letting everyone down"", ""broken and lifeless"" (hopelessness, worthlessness, despair).
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** None.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point."" - Yes, the writer claims ownership of the thought/intent.
*   **Rejection noted?** ""I'm ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not."" - There is ambivalence, but the preceding statement ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself"" is a strong active intent. This ambivalence is not a full explicit disavowal (""I don't actually want to"") that would trigger a downgrade to Indicator.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Present intent:** ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point."" (Indicates a current state or ongoing desire/effort).
*   **Future ideation:** ""I'm ready to say goodbye"" (could be future, but lacks specificity).

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Rules out ATTEMPT)

*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point.""
    *   **Specific method/preparation:** No.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** The phrase ""at this point"" indicates a current state of being or desire, but it does not specify an *imminent* action like ""tonight"" or ""right now."" It's not strong enough to meet the ""imminent timeline"" criteria for BEHAVIOR.

*   Given the above, let's check the definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is a clear expression of active suicidal desire (""trying to kill myself""), not just distress or rejected thoughts. The ambivalence is not a full rejection.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because despite strong intent, there is no specific method, preparation, or *imminent* timeline (like ""tonight"", ""right now""). ""At this point"" is too general to qualify as ""imminent.""
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits. It describes ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan."" The phrase ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point"" is an expression of active suicidal desire. It lacks a specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline that would make it an ""actionable plan"" for Behavior.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, all analysis is on the writer's statements.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as no immediacy is present to trump.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The ambivalence (""but I'm also not"") is not a strong enough explicit disavowal to downgrade to Indicator. The primary statement of intent is too strong.

Therefore, the post expresses active suicidal desire without a concrete plan or imminent timeline.

    *   **Past actions:** None described by the user.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it."" ""I could do it right now."" ""The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared to die..."" This clearly indicates active suicidal desire and a perception of immediate capability.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""hope that I don't wake up"" is passive, but the primary intent is active.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The post states ""The only thing preventing me...is my fear of death"" and ""The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared to die"". This is a *barrier* to action, not a rejection of the *desire* itself. The desire is explicitly present. This is *not* ""I don't actually want to"" (which would be an Indicator).

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Reference to parents' past actions. No past *user* attempts.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I could do it right now."" This is a strong statement of immediate perceived capability and intent.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""hope that I don't wake up"" (non-specific future wish).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Rule: Writer-focused).
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""killing myself"", ""I'm done"").
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** No specific method or *current user-initiated* preparation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes, ""I could do it right now."" This directly matches the ""Imminent timeline"" criterion for **Behavior**.
        *   *Critical expansion for Behavior*: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" ""I could do it right now"" is a clear expression of immediate intent and perceived capability.
        *   The presence of fear acts as a *barrier* to action, but it does not negate the explicit *intent* or the statement of *immediate capability*. The desire is present, and the individual perceives themselves as able to act *right now*, even if fear is holding them back. This is distinct from ""I don't actually want to.""

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No, because ""I could do it right now"" provides immediacy.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is explicit suicidal desire and perceived immediate capability.

    Based on the framework, the presence of ""I could do it right now"" combined with explicit suicidal intent (""killing myself"", ""I'm done"") places this squarely in the **Behavior** category, as it indicates immediate intent and perceived capability, even with an acknowledged barrier.

    *   This points strongly to **IDEATION**.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
    *   No, there is clear, active suicidal desire (""I want to kill myself""). The *rejection downgrade* rule applies if the person says ""I don't *actually* want to"" or similar. Here, the person *does* want to, but is inhibited by fear. This is distinct from rejecting the thought itself.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *are* expressions of active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"". ""No preparation or immediate timeline."" The fear of death acts as a *barrier to action*, but the *ideation* (the desire to die and kill oneself) is clearly present and active.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no past action.

The core of the post is an explicit desire for suicide, without a concrete plan or immediate timeline, but with an internal barrier (fear of death) preventing action. This aligns with Ideation.

    *   **Future ideation:** Positive future outlook (""Life will be challenging going forward, but I'll make it work"").

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** The post describes being ""days away from going through with"" a plan and having letters written. This is extremely close to an attempt, but the definition of ""Attempt"" requires ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" or ""interrupted/aborted attempts"" (e.g., ""put belt around neck but stopped""). Being ""days away"" from going through with it, while highly concerning, doesn't describe the *initiation* of self-harm that was then stopped. It describes final preparations and proximity to the act, but not the act itself. So, it doesn't quite meet the ""Attempt"" criteria.

    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** *Past* explicit intent and preparations are described. However, the *current* intent is explicitly *not* suicidal. The post is about *overcoming* that past intent.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** There is no *current* explicit suicide desire. The desire is explicitly stated as being to *live*.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** The post describes *past* severe distress and *past* actionable plans. Crucially, the *current* message is one of *rejection* of those past suicidal thoughts/plans and a strong affirmation of life (""I made the decision to live""). The ""IRREDUCIBLE RULE: Rejection downgrade: 'I don't actually want to' → indicator"" is highly relevant here. The post is a clear statement of *not wanting to* (anymore) and choosing to live. While it details past high-risk behavior, the *current* communication is one of resilience and overcoming, which aligns with the spirit of the ""Indicator"" category for current risk assessment. The past serious intent is now *rejected*.

Given the strong emphasis on the current decision to live and the rejection of past suicidal intent, the primary message of the post is one of overcoming and resilience, which, in the context of current risk classification, aligns with the 'Indicator' category due to the explicit rejection rule.

    *   Past focus: The *triggering event* (""fucked up yesterday"") is past. The *feeling* of being suicidal is described as a current state (""never been more suicidal in my life"").
    *   Present intent: The *feeling* is present and intense. There is no explicit *plan* or *action* for the present.
    *   Future ideation: No specific future timing for an action.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""never been more suicidal in my life"" indicates a strong active suicidal desire/state.

        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, ""never been more suicidal in my life"" clearly expresses an active suicidal desire or state.
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no method, no preparation, no immediate timeline.
        *   Therefore, this fits IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, because the post explicitly states ""suicidal,"" which is beyond general distress or rejected thoughts.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is an explicit expression of being ""suicidal,"" which is active suicidal desire, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
*   **Ideation:** Fits well. ""Explicit wish to die"" is conveyed by ""never been more suicidal in my life."" There are no actionable methods, preparation, or immediate timeline.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, ""I've never been more suicidal.""
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior, so Ideation is the highest applicable.
3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.

    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal. The ""i'm sorry"" is an apology for the statement, not a rejection of the suicidal thought itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""i'm considering suicide"".
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.

The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior also states: ""Expressions of immediate intent... qualify even without method details"". While ""considering"" is not a definitive plan, ""right now i'm considering suicide because i can't fucking take it anymore"" indicates an active, immediate, and serious contemplation driven by overwhelming current distress. The ""right now"" is key, pushing it beyond general ideation.

    *   Comparing with definitions:
        *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire (""considering suicide"").
        *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because it has an ""immediate timeline"" (""right now""), which is a key boundary for Ideation becoming Behavior.
        *   **Behavior:** This fits. The ""right now"" provides the imminent timeline. The phrase ""i'm considering suicide because i can't fucking take it anymore"" is an expression of immediate intent/consideration due to an inability to cope.
        *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
        2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt is present.
        3.  Immediacy trumps: ""right now"" is immediate, supporting Behavior.
        4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection.
        5.  Output exactly one: Yes.

The presence of ""right now"" combined with ""considering suicide"" and the overwhelming distress (""can't fucking take it anymore"") aligns this post with the ""Behavior"" category due to the implied immediacy and active, serious contemplation.

I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

*   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
*   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **Past actions:** ""never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone."" This describes past self-harm or property damage, but *not* a past suicide attempt. The focus is on *not* harming others.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic."" ""I want to check I'm making the right decision."" The writer is actively considering and logically endorsing the idea of suicide.
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** There is a *partial* rejection: ""some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help"". HOWEVER, this is immediately qualified and undermined: ""why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above."" This is *not* an explicit disavowal; rather, it's a statement that the logical arguments for suicide are currently outweighing the internal voice that says it's wrong. This does not meet the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule's threshold of ""I don't actually want to"".

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** Mentions past anger issues and self-harm (not suicidal attempts).
*   **Present intent:** ""I want to check I'm making the right decision."" This indicates active, current consideration of suicide.
*   **Future ideation:** The utilitarian logic is about preventing future pain, leading to a future decision, but the *process of deciding* is present. No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The self-harm mentioned is not described as a suicide attempt.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""end my own life"", ""killing myself"").
    *   Specific method: No.

    *   Therefore, it does *not* qualify as BEHAVIOR.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
    *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, strongly implied by the logical justification for ending their life.
    *   Non-actionable methods: No specific methods mentioned (which means no actionable ones either).
    *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes, this is true.
    *   This path fits the post content. The writer is actively desiring and logically considering suicide, but without a concrete plan or immediate intent.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because there is clear, active suicidal desire and logical endorsement, not merely distress or truly rejected thoughts. The ""cry for help"" aspect is framed as a voice they are *struggling to justify listening to*, not a definitive rejection of suicidal thoughts.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable (no immediacy).
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The ""rejection"" is not strong enough; the writer is actively seeking validation for their suicidal logic, not disavowing it.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output one category.

**Conclusion:** The post demonstrates a clear, active desire to end their life based on a logical framework, but lacks specific methods, preparations, or an immediate timeline. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   Therefore, it does *not* meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes (""don't want it anymore"", ""end it all"", ""don't want to be here"").
        *   Non-actionable methods: The mention of a gun that cannot be obtained, and the subsequent question about finding ""a good option"" for ending it all, fits the description of desiring a method without having an actionable one.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes.
        *   This fits the criteria for IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is clear active suicidal desire.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior, so ideation is the highest applicable.
3.  Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection of the desire to die. The inability to get a gun is a practical limitation, not a disavowal of intent.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses clear active suicidal desire (""end it all"", ""don't want to be here"") and a search for a method (""Why isn't there a good option...""), but lacks a specific, actionable plan, preparation, or immediate timeline. The mention of a gun is immediately negated by its unavailability. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not. I believe in God but sometimes he feels so far away. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to post. I have no one to talk to.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I wish I could die"", ""I would worry about them if I died"", ""I wish I could curl up and die"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** General unhappiness, feeling like a failure, anxiety, depression, feeling God is far away, having no one to talk to. These indicate distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None related to suicide.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The phrases ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die"" express a desire for death or an end to suffering.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not clearly passive.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** This is crucial. The statement ""I would worry about them if I died"" (referring to the dogs) acts as a significant protective factor and a stated reason *not* to die. This functions as a form of rejection or disavowal of acting on the suicidal thoughts.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** The wishes are present-focused, but not immediate plans.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future plans.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. So, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → The post contains ""I wish I could die,"" which is an explicit desire. However, the presence of the protective factor (""I would worry about them if I died"") needs to be considered in light of the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This is where the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule comes into play. While ""I wish I could die"" is an explicit wish, the immediate follow-up ""I would worry about them if I died"" functions as a strong internal barrier and a reason *not* to act on that wish. This aligns with the spirit of ""rejected/intrusive thoughts"" or ""I don't actually want to"" because the writer is articulating a reason *not* to pursue the wish for death. The wish is present, but it is immediately countered by a self-identified protective factor, indicating a lack of active, actionable intent.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Application:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** This rule is key. The statement ""I would worry about them if I died"" acts as a strong internal rejection of the suicidal act, indicating that despite the wish, there is a clear reason for the writer *not* to proceed. This downgrades the explicit wish to die from Ideation to Indicator, as the intent is not actively endorsed for action.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Based on the above, the classification is Indicator.

316,"Nsfw. So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

*   **Indirect death references:** None.
*   **Emotional markers:** ""disappointed in myself,"" ""dislike it,"" ""hate it,"" ""disgusted,"" ""hateful I felt towards myself,"" ""ugly I felt,"" ""Terrible feeling."" - Strong indicators of distress, self-loathing, and despair.

*   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself."" - This indicates an active desire or thought process, not merely an intrusive thought or a rejected idea. The ""wanting"" is key.
*   **Passive experience:** No, it's not presented as intrusive or external.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** No explicit disavowal of the *desire* to kill themselves. The ""terrible feeling"" refers to the act of masturbating to the thought, not a rejection of the suicidal thought itself.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** The phrase ""kept thinking about wanting to kill myself"" describes a persistent thought in the recent past leading up to the described event.

*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
    *   No, there is an explicit expression of active suicidal desire (""wanting to kill myself""), which goes beyond mere distress or rejected thoughts.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is an explicit expression of active suicidal desire, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
*   **Ideation:** This category fits perfectly. The post explicitly states ""wanting to kill myself,"" which is an active suicidal desire, but it lacks any specific plan, method, preparation, or immediate timeline that would elevate it to ""Behavior.""
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to the absence of a specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline. The act of masturbating to the thought, while disturbing, is not a suicidal *behavior* (i.e., an action taken towards ending one's life).
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past concrete self-harm action with suicidal intent is described.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, analysis is solely on the writer's statements.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt or behavior is present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable, no immediacy.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

The writer consistently affirms their personal desire to end their life.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None related to suicide action.
    *   **Present intent:** No immediate present intent. The concluding sentence ""I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed"" indicates an immediate plan to sleep, not to act on suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""when I end my life"" is stated as a certainty but without a specific timeline. ""wanting to end my life"" describes an ongoing desire.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Rule: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation)
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, clearly stated.
        *   Specific method: No.
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No. The post explicitly states the user is going to bed, which contradicts an immediate plan.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear, active, and endorsed suicidal desire. (Rule: Rejection downgrade does not apply as the thoughts are endorsed).

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *are* expressions of active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. There is an ""Explicit wish to die"" (""would rather die prematurely"", ""wanting to end my life""), no specific method or preparation, and no immediate timeline.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, analysis is on the user's own statements.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No attempt or behavior, so Ideation is the highest applicable.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present; the ""going to bed"" statement negates any implied immediate intent.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable; the user *endorses* their suicidal thoughts.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

The post clearly expresses an active, personal desire to end one's life, viewing it as a solution and escape. However, it lacks specific details about *how* or *when* this would occur, and the final sentence explicitly indicates a non-suicidal immediate action (going to bed). This strong desire without a concrete, imminent plan aligns with Ideation.

318,"""your not cutting your faking it!"" stares at my arm motherfuckerly. Im tired of all the people who miraculously believe that im either cutting for attention or faking it. I've had issues with self harm in the past and I've gotten to the point where nobody really believes that im in pain. A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references (writer):** None. The phrase ""encouraging K to kill herself"" refers to someone else (K), not the writer, so per Rule 1, it's ignored for the writer's classification.
    *   **Indirect death references (writer):** ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" - This expresses profound despair and questions the value of life, which is an indirect indicator of suicidal ideation, but not an explicit death reference.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""tired of all the people"", ""in pain"", ""numb and empty inside"", ""cried myself to sleep"". These clearly indicate distress, hopelessness, and emotional pain.
    *   **Specific methods (writer):** None for suicide. The post mentions ""cutting"" and ""self harm"" in the past, but the stated intent was ""to relieve some of the pain,"" not to die.
    *   **Preparations (writer):** None.
    *   **Past actions (writer):** ""I've had issues with self harm in the past"". ""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out."" This describes a past incident of self-harm. The stated intent ""to relieve some of the pain"" suggests non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) rather than a suicide attempt, as it lacks explicit suicidal intent (i.e., intent to die).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** No active endorsement of suicidal intent. ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is a question of life's value, not an active desire to die.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not explicitly stated.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit rejection, but also no explicit suicidal thoughts to reject.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** The detailed description of self-harm (""A few months ago..."") and general ""issues with self harm in the past"" are clearly past-focused.
    *   **Present intent:** None.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is a future-oriented expression of despair and questioning life's value, but not a specific plan or intent.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?**
        The post describes past self-harm: ""used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain"". The definition for ""Attempt"" requires ""actual self-harm with *suicidal intent*."" The stated intent (""to relieve some of the pain"") does not explicitly indicate an intent to die. Therefore, this past self-harm incident, as described, does not meet the criteria for a ""suicide attempt"" within this framework. It is a description of past non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI).

    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        No explicit suicide intent. The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is not an explicit intent to die, nor is it paired with a method, preparation, or immediate timeline.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        No explicit suicide desire. The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" falls under ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" rather than an ""explicit wish to die"" (like ""I want to die"").

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
        The post contains:
        *   ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"": ""Im tired of all the people"", ""in pain"", ""numb and empty inside"", ""cried myself to sleep"", and critically, ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"". This last phrase is a strong indicator of despair and questioning life's value, fitting within this category.
        *   The description of past self-harm, while significant for risk assessment in general, does not fit into ""Attempt"" (due to lack of explicit suicidal intent) or ""Behavior"" (as it's past and not current suicidal intent). It serves as context for the writer's current distress.

    Based on the systematic analysis, the post primarily conveys significant emotional distress, past non-suicidal self-harm, and a general questioning of life's worth, without expressing explicit suicidal intent, plans, or immediate actions to end life. This aligns best with the ""Indicator"" category.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions).

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicidal ideation"", ""act on my suicidal thoughts"". These are direct references to suicidal thoughts and the potential for suicidal action.
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""depressive spell"", ""spiraling worse"", ""long wait in depression time scales"", ""worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and overwhelm.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **Past actions:** No past suicide attempts or self-harm actions are described. The past actions are related to coping mechanisms and seeking support (""tried reaching out to friends and family"").

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer acknowledges having ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts."" This indicates ownership of these thoughts.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not presented as purely intrusive; the writer is actively grappling with the *potential* to ""act on my suicidal thoughts.""
    *   **Rejection noted?** Yes, but crucially, it's a rejection of *action*, not of the thoughts themselves. ""I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point"" and ""while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change."" This shows the thoughts are present and a concern, but the writer is actively trying to *prevent* acting on them *at this moment*. This is a critical distinction from the ""Indicator"" category's ""rejected/intrusive thoughts"" where the thought itself is disavowed. Here, the *action* is being prevented, implying the *ideation* is real.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes historical context of bipolar symptoms and past coping attempts. No past suicidal *actions*.
    *   **Present intent:** The ""suicidal ideation"" is current (""considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation""). The intent is to *prevent* acting on the thoughts *now*. ""I don't think I'm a danger to myself *at this point*.""
    *   **Future ideation:** ""that can change"" (referring to being a danger to self) indicates a future concern about the escalation of ideation. The plan is to get help in the future (""wait for the 1st"").

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Rule: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation)
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" are present.
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No. The post explicitly states ""I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point"" and the desire to go to the hospital *instead* of acting, and waiting for insurance. This negates immediate intent to act. (Rule: Immediacy trumps).
        *   Therefore, not **BEHAVIOR**.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   Explicit wish to die: The presence of ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" implies a desire to end suffering or life, even if the immediate goal is to prevent acting on it. The writer is struggling *with* these thoughts.
        *   Non-actionable methods: None explicitly stated, but also no *actionable* methods.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Confirmed. The writer is actively trying to *avoid* action and seeking help.
        *   *Key boundary*: This fits the description. The thoughts are active and a concern, but there's no plan or immediate intent to act.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
        *   No, it's not *only* distress or metaphors. ""Suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" are direct, non-metaphorical expressions of suicidal content.
        *   While the *action* is rejected (""rather... go to the hospital than act on""), the *thoughts* themselves are acknowledged as present and a significant concern that requires intervention. This is distinct from ""my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to"" where the thought is framed as intrusive and unwanted. Here, the thoughts are acknowledged as the writer's own, and the struggle is to prevent them from escalating to action.

**Conclusion:** The post clearly describes the presence of ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" which the writer is actively trying to manage and prevent from escalating into action by seeking help. There is no specific plan, method, or immediate intent to act. This aligns perfectly with the definition of **Ideation**.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead.""
    *   **Indirect death references:** None beyond the explicit.
    *   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness, despair, anger, resentment towards family and the system.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **Past actions:** ""I once took an antipsychotic"" (describes past medication experience, not a suicide attempt).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead"" are active expressions of desire and expectation.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Reference to past medication experience, not suicide.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I hope I die soon"" (present desire).
    *   **Future ideation:** ""Soon I will be finally dead."" This is a declarative statement about a future event, linked to an impending trigger (institutionalization within 4 weeks). ""Soon"" implies a near future, but not necessarily ""immediate"" in the sense of hours/days.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: ""Soon"". The definition for ""Behavior"" specifies ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"". ""Soon"" is not as immediate as these examples. While it's a strong declaration linked to an upcoming event (within 4 weeks), it doesn't meet the strict ""immediate"" criteria for Behavior.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes. ""I hope I die soon"" fits this. ""Soon I will be finally dead"" is a strong declaration of future intent, but without a specific method or the *defined immediate timeline* for Behavior. The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation states: ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"". ""Soon"" does not fit this.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear active suicidal desire.

    **Conclusion based on strict definitions:** The post expresses a strong, active desire for death in the near future (""soon,"" linked to avoiding institutionalization). However, it lacks a specific method, preparation, or the *explicitly defined immediate timeline* (""tonight,"" ""right now,"" ""this weekend"") required to classify it as ""Behavior."" Therefore, it falls under ""Ideation"" as an explicit wish to die without an actionable plan or defined immediate timeline.

321,"What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem. I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** The question ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem"" is a direct inquiry about a specific, lethal method for suicide. The brain stem is a critical target for immediate death.
    *   **Indirect death references:** Implied by the above.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things."" This indicates severe hopelessness, anhedonia, and a complete rejection of protective factors or reasons to live.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""gun"" and ""hitting the brain stem."" This is a very specific and lethal method.
    *   **Preparations:** Asking for specific technical details about *how* to execute a suicide method can be considered a form of preparation or research into means.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer is actively seeking specific information to carry out a suicidal act. The statements ""I genuinely do not care"" confirm active ownership of these thoughts and a rejection of life-affirming perspectives.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No, the writer explicitly *rejects* reasons to live, not the suicidal thoughts themselves.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** The question is current, seeking information for a potential immediate or near-future action.
    *   **Future ideation:** While no explicit timeline like ""tonight"" is given, the specificity of the method and the active seeking of execution details push it beyond mere future ideation. It implies a readiness to act once the information is obtained.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
        *   No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → BEHAVIOR**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, clearly implied by the question about a lethal method and the rejection of reasons to live.
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""gun"" and ""hitting the brain stem."" This is a highly specific and actionable method.
        *   **Preparation:** The act of asking for specific execution details for a lethal method constitutes a form of preparation/research into means.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** While not explicitly ""tonight,"" the specificity of the method and the active seeking of *how* to execute it elevates it beyond general ideation. It demonstrates intent and capability, which are key components of 'Behavior'. The user is not just thinking about dying; they are inquiring about the practical steps for a specific, lethal method.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → IDEATION**
        *   This does not fit, as there is a specific method and active information seeking for execution, which goes beyond mere desire.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → INDICATOR**
        *   This does not fit, as there is clear active suicidal desire and a specific method.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** No, contains active suicidal desire and specific method.
*   **Ideation:** No, because a specific method (""gun,"" ""brain stem"") is stated, and the user is seeking actionable information about its use. This is beyond ""non-actionable methods.""
*   **Behavior:** Yes.
    *   ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"" - Yes, ""gun"" and ""hitting the brain stem.""
    *   ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note"" - Seeking specific technical information on *how* to use a gun for suicide effectively can be considered a form of preparation/research for the act.
    *   ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"" - While not explicitly stated, the specificity of the method and the active seeking of execution details strongly implies intent and capability, pushing it into the 'Behavior' category. The user is moving beyond passive desire to active inquiry about execution.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** N/A (no attempt).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While no explicit immediacy, the specificity of the method and the active seeking of execution details (capability) are strong indicators for 'Behavior'.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal thoughts; instead, a rejection of reasons to live.

This post demonstrates specific intent, a specific method, and active steps (seeking information) towards capability.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""thought about killing myself"" (stated as a daily occurrence).
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""everything just keeps getting worse"", ""upset over"", ""dramatic"" (mother's perception, but reflects the user's distress).
    *   Specific methods: None mentioned.
    *   Preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Past actions: ""my mum saw my self harm scars"". This indicates a history of self-harm. Given the context of constant suicidal thoughts (""haven't thought about killing myself"" every single day), it's highly probable that this self-harm was either a suicide attempt or closely related to suicidal intent. The ""Attempt"" definition includes ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent."" The scars are a description of past self-harm, and the constant suicidal thoughts provide the ""suicidal intent"" context.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""i haven't thought about killing myself"" indicates a persistent, active thought process, though phrased as a past/ongoing state rather than immediate desire.
    *   Passive experience: ""it wont leave my head"" suggests the thoughts are intrusive and persistent.
    *   Rejection noted? No explicit rejection (""I don't want to do it""). ""It won't leave my head"" implies a lack of control, not a disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""haven't thought about killing myself"" (describes a continuous state from the past to present). ""my mum saw my self harm scars"" (a past event).
    *   Present intent: No immediate plan or intent.
    *   Future ideation: No specific future plan.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described?
        *   Yes. The presence of ""self harm scars"" in conjunction with the statement ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself"" strongly suggests a history of self-harm performed with suicidal intent. The ""Attempt"" definition includes ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent."" The scars are physical evidence of past self-harm, and the persistent suicidal ideation provides the context of suicidal intent for that self-harm. This qualifies as an ""Attempt"" based on the provided definition.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
        2.  Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since ""Attempt"" is identified, it takes precedence.
        3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as there's no immediate intent.
        4.  Rejection downgrade: ""it wont leave my head"" is not an explicit rejection; it's about persistence.
        5.  Output exactly one: Will output 'attempt'.

    Therefore, the most fitting category is 'Attempt' due to the description of past self-harm (scars) contextualized by persistent suicidal thoughts.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""killing myself"", ""Let's just do it"", ""sick of life"".
    *   Indirect death references: ""my only way out"".
    *   Emotional markers: ""don't know what the fuck to do anymore"", ""feel like trash"", ""no amount of sleep helps"".
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself."" ""Let's just do it."" This is clear, active, self-directed intent.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: ""Let's just do it."" This phrase strongly implies an immediate or very near-future intent to act.
    *   Future ideation: No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → Yes.
        *   Explicit suicide intent: ""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself.""
        *   Immediate timeline: ""Let's just do it"" functions as an expression of immediate intent, akin to ""right now"" or ""tonight,"" even if not explicitly stated. The ""Critical expansion"" for BEHAVIOR states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" ""Let's just do it"" fits this perfectly.

    Therefore, the post points to **BEHAVIOR**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator**: Ruled out due to active suicidal desire and immediate intent.
*   **Ideation**: Ruled out because ""Let's just do it"" implies an immediate call to action, pushing it beyond mere desire without immediacy. The definition states: ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"". ""Let's just do it"" serves as ""now"".
*   **Behavior**: Fits. Explicit intent (""killing myself"") combined with an expression of immediate intent (""Let's just do it"").
*   **Attempt**: Ruled out as no past action is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes (""I"", ""my"").
2.  Temporal hierarchy: N/A, as only one category applies.
3.  Immediacy trumps: ""Let's just do it"" signifies immediacy, leading to Behavior.

    *   **Past actions:** ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out"", ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year"".

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer clearly states active intent: ""I'm going to attempt again"", ""I want to die"", ""I choose not to get better"", ""I am not fighting anymore because I give up"". There is no ambiguity or rejection of these thoughts.
    *   **Passive experience:** None.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → **YES**. The post explicitly states: ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year"".
    *   According to the ""IRREDUCIBLE RULES"": ""Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation"". The presence of described past attempts immediately classifies the post as 'Attempt', overriding other concurrent elements like imminent behavior or ideation.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post contains clear descriptions of past suicide attempts (""tried to overdose three times"", ""my first attempt""). According to the framework's ""Temporal hierarchy"" rule (Attempt > Behavior > Ideation) and the definition of ""Attempt"" (""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"", ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"", ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned""), this is the highest applicable category. While the post also expresses imminent intent (""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again""), the explicit mention of past actions takes precedence in this classification system.

    *   **Emotional markers:** ""fighting it but I can't anymore,"" ""stuck away,"" ""not there,"" ""doing nothing,"" ""best friend drowned,"" ""mom doesn't remember,"" ""father is a pedophile,"" ""family wants nothing to do with me,"" ""became an alcoholic."" These indicate profound hopelessness, worthlessness, despair, and unbearable emotional pain.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None related to self-harm or suicide.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I just want this pain to end."" This is an active, current desire of the writer. It's not presented as an intrusive or rejected thought.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes a history of traumatic events and personal struggles.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I just want this pain to end"" is a present desire.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future timing.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: ""I just want this pain to end"" implies a desire for death.
        *   Specific method/preparation: None.
        *   Immediate timeline: None.
        *   Therefore, this path does not lead to BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: ""I just want this pain to end"" in this context is an explicit wish for the cessation of profound suffering, which equates to a desire for death.
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no method or timeline is mentioned.
        *   This points to IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, because ""I just want this pain to end"" goes beyond mere distress or metaphor; it's an active desire for the ultimate end of suffering, which is a form of suicidal desire, and it's not rejected.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** This post contains more than just general unhappiness or metaphorical death references. The desire for the ""pain to end"" is active and deeply rooted in the context of overwhelming life circumstances, implying a desire for death.
*   **Ideation:** This fits well. There is an explicit wish for the cessation of pain (implying death) without a specific plan, method, or immediate timeline.

While ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"" is a strong expression of intent, it lacks the *immediacy* (hours/days) required for ""Behavior"" without a method.

    *   Let's check against Category Definitions:
        *   **Indicator**: No, because there is clear active suicidal desire (""I'm suicidal"", ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go""). It's not just distress or rejected thoughts.
        *   **Ideation**: Fits. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"" (matches ""I'm suicidal"", ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go""). ""No preparation or immediate timeline."" While ""past this summer"" is a timeline, it's not *immediate* enough to push it into ""Behavior"" based on the provided examples for ""imminent timeline"" (""tonight"", ""right now"", ""this weekend"").
        *   **Behavior**: Does not fit. There is no specific method, no preparation evidence, and the timeline (""past this summer"") is not *imminent* as defined by the examples for this category. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior (""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight')"") is not met because ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"" lacks the explicit ""tonight"" or ""right now"" qualifier.
        *   **Attempt**: No past attempt described.

    *   The post expresses a strong, active desire to die, and sets a temporal boundary (""past this summer""). However, it lacks a concrete plan (method, preparation) or an *immediate* timeline (like ""tonight"" or ""now"") that would classify it as ""Behavior."" Therefore, it falls under ""Ideation.""

I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am.

*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** No, the opposite. The post expresses a firm commitment to action.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" (Explicit past attempt)
*   **Present intent:** ""I promise I wont fail this time.""
*   **Future ideation:** ""Gonna be gone after this weekend."" (Specific imminent timeline)

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   Start here →
*   a) **Any past suicide attempt described?** → ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" **YES.** This directly matches the definition and clarification for 'Attempt'.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all statements are about the writer's own actions and intentions.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. The explicit mention of a past attempt (""I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."") takes precedence over the current plans and intent.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While there is clear immediacy (""after this weekend""), the presence of a past attempt is the highest category.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal thoughts or intent.
5.  **Output exactly one:** 'attempt'.

**Conclusion:** The post clearly describes a past suicide attempt (""I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."") which, according to the framework's temporal hierarchy and definition, classifies it as 'Attempt'. The concurrent specific plans and imminent timeline would qualify as 'Behavior', but the explicit past attempt is the overriding factor.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I'm planning on killing myself"". Yes, the writer owns the thought.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""I still have a long time to rethink my decisions. I can still seek out help over the course of the passing years."" This indicates a *conditional* intent or postponement, not an outright rejection or disavowal of the suicidal desire itself. The desire is present, but conditional on future circumstances. It does not fit the ""I don't actually want to"" rejection rule (Rule 4).

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** No.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""at 30 or 25"", ""by the time im around that age"", ""innnn 8 yrs or so"". This is a very distant, non-immediate future timeline.

        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""I'm planning on killing myself"", ""this life for me isn't it"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no specific method/preparation, and the timeline is very distant (""at 30 or 25"", ""innnn 8 yrs or so"").
        *   This matches the definition of **Ideation**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an explicit expression of active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"". Yes, ""I'm planning on killing myself"" fits. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". Yes, the timeline is very distant and conditional. This fits.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of past action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as only ideation is present.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as there is no immediacy.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The ""rethink"" and ""seek help"" statements are conditional postponements, not a rejection of the underlying desire itself if conditions persist. The desire is still explicitly stated for a future scenario.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output 'ideation'.

The post expresses a clear, active suicidal desire with a very distant and conditional future timeline, lacking any immediate plan or preparation. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""suicide rate"" is mentioned, but it's a statistical observation, not a personal statement of intent.
    *   Indirect death references: ""teetering on the edge"" is a metaphor for being close to a crisis or breakdown, not a direct reference to death or suicide.
    *   Emotional markers: Feeling ""perceived as male and a threat,"" ""eyed with suspicion."" This indicates significant distress, alienation, and possibly hopelessness.
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: No statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself."" The ""teetering on the edge"" expresses a state of crisis, not an active suicidal desire.
    *   Passive experience: Not present.
    *   Rejection noted?: No explicit rejection, but crucially, no explicit *endorsement* of suicidal thoughts either. The mention of suicide rate is an observation about a demographic, not a personal intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" describes a recent, ongoing state of distress.
    *   Present intent: No immediate plans.
    *   Future ideation: No non-specific future intent.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. There is no explicit suicide intent. The ""teetering on the edge"" is distress, not intent.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. There is no explicit wish to die (""want to die,"" ""don't deserve to live""). The mention of ""suicide rate"" is an external observation, not a personal desire.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post expresses significant distress (""teetering on the edge,"" feeling threatened/suspiciously eyed) and uses a metaphor for being in crisis. There is no active suicidal desire or intent expressed by the writer.

**Conclusion based on Category Definitions:**
The post clearly indicates distress and a metaphorical state of being close to a breakdown (""teetering on the edge""). However, it lacks any explicit statement of desiring death, specific plans, or past attempts. The reference to the ""suicide rate"" is an observation about a demographic, not a personal declaration of intent. This fits the definition of **Indicator**.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours."" This is a clear, active statement of intent to end their life. The sarcastic ""Thanks mom"" suggests that the mother's comment, rather than deterring, might have solidified or accelerated the intent.

    *   Rejection noted? No rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"", ""I should do it now"") combined with a clear immediate timeline (""now""). The ongoing self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") further indicates a state of crisis and active self-destructive behavior, even if not explicitly a *suicide method* in itself.

    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal. The phrase ""before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience"" is a conditional statement for *why* they want to die, not a rejection of the desire to die.

The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

    *   **Future ideation:** Not the primary focus.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → Yes. The post explicitly states ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and provides a detailed description of an overdose attempt from ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning"".
    *   This directly matches the definition of **ATTEMPT**: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"", ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"", ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt. The temporal hierarchy rule (Attempt > Behavior > Ideation) confirms this.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all content is about the writer's experiences and actions.

And of course I can't consoling about it because I know some Petersonain victim blamer is going to come here and tell me to work harder; even though I am doing all the right things. My life sucks solely because of factors outside of my control. Life for many is nothing more than a total curse and for others it is paradise. We are working longer and harder for less and less all to satisfy endless Billionaire greed. A factory worker in the 50s-70s had a higher standard of living than a young professional does now. Being a Man it is hard for me to find love and I am attacked for dating to have standards (just want a fair deal (and no I am not talking about looks); I am not asking for some blonde hair princess). Women can valuation and offers while a Man has to do all the work (yay equality amirite /s). I've been bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life. My parents won't accept me for who I am because I do not believe the harsh faith I was raised and have no way out cause I don't have a loving partner to go to. And I have other issues with them. You try living through South Asian Muslim culture (even in the west). I have nothing but whenever I complain I'm attacked, victim blames, and some sociopath out here is going to kick me when I am down. 99% of your life is luck; that's one thing I'm sure off. Hard work and all the rest can make some improvements on the margins but luck is the core determinant",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None. The post uses strong negative language about life (""horrible life"", ""life sucks"", ""total curse"") but does not mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live.""
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse"" is a strong statement of despair and hopelessness about life in general, but it's not a direct reference to the *poster's* desire for death or an indirect reference to their own demise. It's more a philosophical/existential lament.
    *   **Emotional markers:** Abundant: ""horrible life,"" ""life sucks,"" ""total curse,"" ""bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life,"" ""no way out,"" ""nothing,"" ""whenever I complain I'm attacked."" These clearly indicate deep despair, hopelessness, victimhood, and a sense of being trapped.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None related to suicide attempts (""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" ""overdosed""). The post mentions past bullying and harassment.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** No. The writer does not claim ownership of suicidal thoughts or express a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I will kill myself""). The focus is on external factors, societal issues, and personal struggles that make their life miserable.
    *   **Passive experience:** No explicit mention of intrusive thoughts.
    *   **Rejection noted?** Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are expressed to be rejected.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes historical experiences (""I've been bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life"").
    *   **Present intent:** Describes current feelings of profound unhappiness, lack of control, and despair (""My life sucks,"" ""I have nothing,"" ""no way out""). Crucially, there is no *present suicidal intent*.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future suicidal ideation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No explicit suicide intent, no method, no preparation, no immediate timeline.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No explicit suicide desire (e.g., ""want to die,"" ""don't deserve to live""). The post expresses deep unhappiness and a feeling of life being a ""curse,"" but it does not articulate a *desire to end that life*.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This is the best fit. The post is overwhelmingly characterized by general unhappiness, hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being a victim of circumstances (""horrible life,"" ""life sucks,"" ""total curse,"" ""no way out,"" ""nothing""). There are no expressions of active suicidal desire. The phrase ""life... is nothing more than a total curse"" is a metaphorical description of life's quality, not an active wish for death.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:**
    *   General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair: **YES** (abundantly present).
    *   Metaphorical death references (""want to disappear""): The ""total curse"" phrase fits this, describing life as unbearable but not explicitly stating a desire to die by suicide.
    *   Rejected/intrusive thoughts: Not present, but not a requirement for Indicator.
    *   NO expressions of active suicidal desire: **YES**, this is critical. The post does not contain ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or similar direct statements of suicidal intent.

This post clearly demonstrates significant emotional distress and hopelessness but lacks any direct or indirect expression of active suicidal desire, intent, plan, or past attempt.

    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""scared"", ""not able to deal"", ""getting panic attacks"", ""not able to sleep properly"", ""feel like a burden"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.

    *   **Past actions:** None related to suicide (mentions being caught yesterday but not a past attempt).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. Phrases like ""I'm feeling suicidal"" and ""I feel the only escape... is suicide"" show the writer actively holds these thoughts and sees suicide as a solution.
    *   **Passive experience:** While ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more"" could imply an intrusive element, the overall context strongly points to active endorsement of the desire.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal. The writer does not say ""but I won't do it"" or similar.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No past suicide attempts described.
    *   **Present intent:** The suicidal feelings and the belief that suicide is the ""only escape"" are present.

    *   **Present intent:** ""I know the way I will end it."", ""I am left wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink."", ""I just want to know how not to be a coward and jump away when I see it approaching."" (These describe current state of mind and desire).

    *   According to the ""IRREDUCIBLE RULES: Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation"", the presence of a past attempt immediately classifies the post as 'Attempt'. The post also contains elements that would otherwise classify as 'Behavior' (specific method, familiarity with location, desire to overcome inhibition to act) and 'Ideation' (explicit wish to die), but the 'Attempt' category takes precedence.
    *   The ""Rejection downgrade"" rule does not apply here to lower the category, as the rejection is not absolute and is contradicted by the active desire to overcome ""cowardice"" and the explicit mention of past attempts.

**Final Classification:** The explicit mention of past suicide attempts (""the times I have tried"", ""the first time I actually attempted"") is the decisive factor, overriding other elements.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: None.
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""People tell me I'm a burden"" - indicates feelings of worthlessness, self-blame, and potentially hopelessness. The description of not leaving the house, no job, living at home, and laying in bed all day points to significant distress, social isolation, and potential depression.
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None related to suicide.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: No active suicidal thoughts or desires are expressed.
    *   Passive experience: No passive thoughts (e.g., ""my brain tells me to die"").
    *   Rejection noted?: Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are present.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: Describes a long-term situation (""since I was 14"").
    *   Present intent: Describes current state (""I lay in bed all day""). No present suicidal intent.
    *   Future ideation: No future suicidal ideation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? → No explicit suicide intent.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? → No explicit suicide desire.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? → Yes. The post expresses significant distress, feelings of being a burden, and a severely limited lifestyle, but without any mention of suicide, death, or a desire to end life. This fits the definition of 'Indicator'.

**Category Definition Check:**
*   **Indicator:** ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair."" - Fits the description of feeling like a burden and the isolated lifestyle. ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire."" - This is true for the post.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

    *   **Preparations:** None explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer states ""I can kill myself"" and ""I just really want to stick some knives..."". These are active desires and plans, not intrusive thoughts.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No. While the writer mentions hating to put friends through it, this is a reason for hesitation, not a rejection or disavowal of the suicidal desire itself. The desire and plan (""I can kill myself on graduation night,"" ""I just really want to stick some knives"") are clearly stated afterwards.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.

        *   **Immediate timeline:** Not present (Graduation night is 1-2 years away, and the desire for knives is not linked to an immediate action).

    According to the decision tree, the presence of explicit suicide intent *and* a specific method is sufficient to classify as **BEHAVIOR**, regardless of an immediate timeline or preparation. The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation (requiring ""tonight"" or ""now"" to become Behavior) appears to describe one way Ideation escalates, but the Behavior definition itself lists ""Specific method stated"" as a standalone criterion. The strong, active desire for a specific, lethal method (""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach"") firmly places this beyond general ideation.

    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""commit"", ""suicide notes"").
    *   **Specific method:** Yes (""tall bridges"", ""a few methods to try"").
    *   **Preparation:** Yes (""spent the past few days researching tall bridges"", ""already drafted my suicide notes"").
    *   **Immediate timeline:** Not ""tonight"" or ""right now,"" but a definite, planned timeline (""when i get home""). The presence of specific methods and preparations strongly indicates 'Behavior' as per its definition: ""Specific method stated"" and ""Preparation evidence"" are both present. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior notes that ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" Here, we have method details and preparation, making it a concrete plan, which fits 'Behavior'.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** No, there is clear active suicidal desire, specific methods, and preparations, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
*   **Ideation:** No, this goes beyond mere desire. It includes concrete actions (researching, drafting notes) and specific methods/locations, which moves it into 'Behavior'. Ideation is ""without actionable plan,"" and this post clearly describes an actionable plan.
*   **Behavior:** Yes. The post demonstrates ""Intent + Capability.""
    *   **Intent:** ""It's settled. ... commit when i get home.""
    *   **Capability (evidence):** ""spent the past few days researching tall bridges"", ""looking for any further help anywhere I can"" (implies seeking means/information), ""I have a few methods to try"", ""already drafted my suicide notes."" These are all concrete preparations and specific methods.
*   **Attempt:** No, no past concrete action of self-harm is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all actions are by the writer.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While the timeline isn't immediate, the *preparations and specific methods* are strong enough to classify as Behavior, as per the definition. The definition of Behavior includes ""Specific method stated"" and ""Preparation evidence"" as key criteria, which are met here.

    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""end it all"", ""kill myself"", ""commit lifen't"", ""end it"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""finally free"", ""blessing"", ""my time"", ""farewell"", ""Goodbye for now!"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""free"", ""blessing"", ""weight off my chest"" (paradoxically positive, indicating resolution towards suicide).
    *   **Specific methods:** None stated.
    *   **Preparations:** ""looking into my options"", ""getting my ducks in a row"". These are clear indicators of active steps being taken.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer repeatedly states ""I'm finally free to end it all"", ""I'm free to commit lifen't"", ""I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row"". This shows clear ownership and active intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** The phrase ""Of course there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it, but I need to have the option to end it all"" is present. However, this is immediately followed by strong affirmations of intent and preparation (""I'm free to get cracking. I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row""). This is not a rejection of the suicidal desire or the preparations, but rather an acknowledgment of a final decision point *after* preparations are complete. It does not negate the active intent to prepare for suicide. According to Irreducible Rule 4, a downgrade only happens if the *desire itself* is rejected (""I don't actually want to""). Here, the desire is very much present and acted upon.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row"" indicates current actions being taken in preparation.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision. Live or die. It could finally be my time. If I decide to end it I'll be sure to wish you all a farewell."" This describes a future act, but the *preparations* are happening *now*, leading to that point. The ""Goodbye for now!"" also suggests a sense of finality and potential immediacy.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""end it all"", ""kill myself"", ""commit lifen't"").
        *   **Specific method:** No.
        *   **Preparation evidence:** Yes. ""looking into my options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row"" are clear descriptions of preparatory actions. This is a key criterion for the **Behavior** category.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** While not ""tonight,"" the active ""getting my ducks in a row"" implies a current, actionable process leading to an imminent decision, rather than vague future ideation.

    *   **Comparison with Categories:**
        *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicide intent and preparations.
        *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is clear evidence of *preparation* (""looking into options"", ""getting ducks in a row""), which moves it beyond mere desire or non-actionable thoughts. The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation is ""No preparation or immediate timeline."" This post has preparation.
        *   **Behavior:** Fits. It has explicit suicide intent (""end it all"") and ""Preparation evidence"" (""looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row""). The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior also includes ""Expressions of immediate intent,"" and while not explicitly ""tonight,"" the ongoing preparation and ""Goodbye for now!"" suggest a planned, imminent action.
        *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

    *   The presence of active preparations (""looking into my options"", ""getting my ducks in a row"") is the strongest factor pushing this into the **Behavior** category. It's not just thinking about it; it's actively taking steps towards it.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""want to kill myself"", ""I need to kill myself"", ""constantly suicidal"", ""allowed assisted suicide"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""stay and suffer"" (implies death as an alternative to suffering).
    *   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness, despair, frustration (""How the fuck am I supposed to get better"", ""can't just go from...overnight"", ""It's all bullshit"", ""People like me are sick"", ""twice as worse to tell me to stay and suffer"").
    *   **Specific methods:** ""assisted suicide"" is mentioned. This is a desired *type* of death, but not a specific, actionable self-harm method within the poster's immediate control (e.g., ""pills,"" ""hanging,"" ""jumping location""). It requires external involvement.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, the writer explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"", ""I need to kill myself"", ""constantly suicidal"", and ""I should be allowed assisted suicide"". These are active expressions of suicidal desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** No, these are not presented as intrusive or rejected thoughts.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal of the suicidal desire. The frustration is about the difficulty of getting better *while* having these desires, not a rejection of the desires themselves.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I want to kill myself"", ""constantly suicidal"" indicate a current and ongoing state of suicidal desire.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""I should be allowed assisted suicide"" is a future-oriented desire for a specific outcome, but not an immediate plan.

        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""want to kill myself"").
        *   Specific method: ""assisted suicide"" is mentioned. However, this is not a specific *self-harm* method the individual can enact themselves (like ""pills"" or ""cutting"") nor does it imply immediate capability. It's a desire for a process of dying, not an actionable plan for self-harm.
        *   Preparation: None.
        *   Immediate timeline: None (""tonight"", ""right now""). ""Constantly suicidal"" indicates an ongoing state, not an imminent action.
        *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.

        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes (""want to kill myself"", ""constantly suicidal"").
        *   Non-actionable methods: ""assisted suicide"" fits here as it's not an immediately actionable self-harm method.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Confirmed.
        *   This aligns with **IDEATION**.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is clear active suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. Explicit wish to die (""want to kill myself"", ""constantly suicidal"") without a specific, actionable plan, preparation, or immediate timeline. The mention of ""assisted suicide"" is a non-actionable method in the context of self-harm.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific actionable method (within the poster's control), preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of past action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.

*   **Indirect death references:** ""to OD on"" - overdose, a specific method of self-harm with lethal intent.
*   **Emotional markers:** Not explicitly stated, but the content implies severe distress.
*   **Specific methods:** ""1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on"" - specifies substances and the method (overdose).
*   **Preparations:** ""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"" - indicates possession of the means, which is a form of preparation.
*   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""Gonna end myself"" - The writer takes ownership of the suicidal thought and expresses active intent.

It does not *describe* a past attempt (e.g., ""Last week I tried to overdose, and now I'm going to try again""). Therefore, it does not fit the ""Attempt"" definition which requires a ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent.""
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""end myself"", ""end it"").
        *   **Specific method:** Yes (""overdose"").
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes (""tonight"").
        *   This combination clearly points to **BEHAVIOR**.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No, there is a plan and immediacy.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear intent, method, and timeline.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all about the writer's own thoughts and plans.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation.** Since no past attempt is *described*, 'Attempt' is not the primary classification. The strong immediate intent takes precedence.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** ""tonight"" is a strong indicator of immediate intent, supporting 'Behavior'.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of thoughts.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'behavior'.

The post expresses clear, active suicidal intent (""end myself"", ""end it""), specifies a method (""overdose""), and indicates an imminent timeline (""tonight""). The use of ""again"" suggests a history but does not *describe* a past attempt, so it doesn't trigger the 'Attempt' category based on the provided definition. The combination of intent, method, and immediacy perfectly aligns with the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""My time on this earth is coming to an end"", ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all."" While ""my time is coming to an end"" can be metaphorical, the subsequent phrase ""My death will release my pain"" explicitly links the end of life to a desired outcome (release from pain), indicating a self-determined end rather than a natural one.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""when a cat knows they're dying and they go into some dark corner to die. That's almost how I feel."" This reinforces the idea of an impending, self-chosen end. ""I know I'm at the end.""
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""can't fight anymore"", ""can't try anymore"", ""so tired"", ""pain"", ""tortured soul."" These indicate profound hopelessness, exhaustion, and suffering.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer claims ownership of these thoughts and feelings (""I think..."", ""I feel..."", ""I know I'm at the end"", ""My death will release...""). The death is presented as a desired resolution to their pain.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No rejection or disavowal. The phrase ""Some people just aren't meant for this world, and that's okay"" normalizes the idea of their own death.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I can't fight anymore, I can't try anymore."" (Current state of giving up)
    *   **Future ideation:** ""in the next month or two."" This is a non-immediate, future-oriented timeframe for the expected/desired death.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. (Rule out ATTEMPT)
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""My death will release my pain"" is a clear desire for death as a solution.
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: ""in the next month or two"" is *not* immediate (e.g., ""tonight"", ""right now"").
        *   Therefore, this does not lead to BEHAVIOR. (Rule out BEHAVIOR)
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, as identified above (""My death will release my pain"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no method/preparation, and the timeline ""in the next month or two"" is not immediate.
        *   This matches the definition of IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? → No, because there is clear explicit suicide desire. (Rule out INDICATOR)

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is active suicidal desire (""My death will release my pain"").
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. There is an explicit wish for death (""My death will release my pain""), no specific method or preparation, and a non-immediate timeline (""in the next month or two"").
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no past action described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No Attempt or Behavior, so Ideation is the highest applicable.
3.  Immediacy trumps: ""in the next month or two"" is not immediate, so it doesn't push it to Behavior.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.
5.  Output exactly one: Yes.

The post clearly expresses an active desire for death as a release from suffering, with a non-immediate timeline and no specific plan, which aligns with the Ideation category.

It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain .

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it"", ""I'm ready to do it"", ""suicide is on my mind"", ""hope I can get the peace i need"" (in context, implying peace through death).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""Run out of options"", ""hit rock bottom"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""Run out of options"", ""hit rock bottom"", ""complete failure"", ""so horrible and fake"", ""fucked everything up"", ""too overwhelming"", ""can't bear the thought"", ""shame"", ""awful"", ""scared"".

    *   **Preparations:** ""about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills"".
    *   **Past actions:** ""I've never done anything like this before"" (explicitly states no past attempts).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I'm ready to do it"", ""I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it"". The writer claims ownership of the intent and action.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""suicide is on my mind"" (could be passive, but immediately followed by active intent).
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options."" This is a crucial point. The ""but I've run out of options"" negates the ""don't want to do this"" as a true rejection that would downgrade the risk. It signifies a feeling of being compelled or having no alternative, rather than a disavowal of the suicidal act itself. The active intent and immediate plan remain strong despite the internal conflict. This is not a ""rejection downgrade"" as per rule 4.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes past mental health struggles and academic setbacks, but explicitly states ""I've never done anything like this before"" regarding suicide.
    *   **Present intent:** ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it"", ""It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills"". This indicates immediate, imminent action.
    *   **Future ideation:** None.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No (""never done anything like this before""). So, not ATTEMPT.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all statements are about the writer's own thoughts and actions.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not an attempt, so Behavior is the highest relevant category.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** The immediate timeline (""about to lock myself in the bathroom"", ""It's currently 6 in the morning here"") strongly supports Behavior.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The statement ""I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options"" is not a rejection that downgrades the intent. The ""but I've run out of options"" indicates a feeling of being compelled, and the subsequent description of immediate action with means overrides any initial ""not wanting to."" The intent to act is still present and actionable.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output a single category.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly demonstrates explicit suicide intent, specific means, and an imminent timeline, placing it firmly in the **Behavior** category.

I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

*   **Emotional markers:** ""fuck up,"" ""never get anything right,"" ""genuinely stupid,"" ""don't know what to do"" - indicate feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and distress.
*   **Specific methods:** ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" - highly specific method.
*   **Preparations:** ""sitting in my car right now"" - this places the individual in the immediate context to execute the method. While not ""acquiring means,"" it's being in a position of immediate capability.
*   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree."" This is an active, current thought process. The individual is actively considering this specific action.
*   **Passive experience:** Not passive.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** The post states, ""I want to tell a suicide hotline but I don't want to be locked up..."" This expresses a desire for help but also a significant barrier to seeking it. Crucially, it does *not* disavow or reject the suicidal thought itself. The thought of driving into a tree is presented as current and active.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** None.
*   **Present intent:** ""I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving..."" - This indicates a present, active consideration of the suicidal act.

    *   The post contains a **specific method** (""driving 100 mph into a tree"") and an **imminent timeline** (""right now"").

The ""Critical expansion"" states ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" Here, we have *both* immediate context (""right now"") *and* method details.
    *   The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation states it ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'."" This post explicitly uses ""right now.""
    *   The irreducible rule ""Immediacy trumps: 'tonight' beats non-specific ideation"" applies here, as ""right now"" indicates strong immediacy.
    *   The internal conflict about calling a hotline does not negate the active, present suicidal thought with a specific method and immediate context.

*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → IDEATION**
    *   This is ruled out because there is a specific method and immediate context (""right now"").

    *   **Future ideation:** ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well."" ""sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing."" (Future-oriented suicidal ideation, non-specific timing).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → **YES**. The post explicitly states, ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" According to the `Attempt` definition, ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" and ""Clarification: 'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt."" Hospitalization for suicide is a strong indication of a past attempt.
    *   **Irreducible Rule 2: Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation.** This rule dictates that if a past attempt is described, it takes precedence over current ideation or behavior.

Therefore, despite the presence of current future-oriented ideation, the explicit mention of a past hospitalization for suicide classifies this post as an `Attempt`.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""wake up even more tired of living"", ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" (This phrase, in context of unyielding suffering and ""tired of living,"" strongly implies ending life.)
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""My mind is hell"", ""losing"", ""painful"", ""nothing changes"", ""worse thoughts each time"", ""eating my mind"", ""tear me down"", ""feel so stupid"", ""feel so weak, so hopeless"", ""nothing makes it go away"", ""nothing there"". These indicate profound hopelessness, worthlessness, and unbearable pain.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** ""tried everything in my capabilities to get better"" (coping, not self-harm). ""started Prozac in December.""

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The phrase ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" is an active statement of intent. It's not presented as an intrusive thought, nor is it rejected. It suggests a decision has been made to take action to end the suffering, implying ending life.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""My mind is hell,"" ""thoughts started coming back,"" ""dreams have been eating my mind"" describe passive experiences of distress.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of the intent to ""stop it.""

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""6 months ago"", ""started Prozac in December"", ""tried everything"".
    *   **Present intent:** ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" This indicates an imminent, present-focused intent. It implies a limited window before an action is taken.
    *   **Future ideation:** None explicitly.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** ""tired of living"" combined with ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" conveys a clear, active intent to end life. ""Stop it"" in this context refers to ending the suffering by ending life.
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** No specific method or preparation is mentioned.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" strongly implies an imminent timeline. This is not a vague future thought; it suggests a critical, limited timeframe before action. This aligns with the ""imminent timeline"" criterion for Behavior and the ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" The phrase implies an urgency and a decision to act soon.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** While there is explicit desire (""tired of living""), the phrase ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" adds a crucial element of immediacy and intent to act, moving it beyond mere Ideation.

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is active intent and an imminent timeline.

**Conclusion based on Category Definitions and Irreducible Rules:**
*   It's not **Indicator** because there is active suicidal desire/intent (""tired of living"", ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"") and no rejection of the thought.
*   It's not purely **Ideation** because the phrase ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" conveys an *imminent timeline* and *immediate intent*, which are key criteria for Behavior.
*   It fits **Behavior** due to the expression of *immediate intent* and an *imminent timeline* (""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it""), even without a specific method. This phrase is a strong indicator that a decision has been made and action is anticipated soon.
*   It's not **Attempt** as no past action is described.

The immediacy implied by ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" is the critical factor that elevates this from Ideation to Behavior, per the ""Immediacy trumps"" rule and the Behavior category's ""Critical expansion.""

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""constantly contemplate suicide"", ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" (implies non-existence/death by suicide).
*   **Indirect death references:** ""I don't want to anymore"" (repeated, in context of despair and suicide contemplation, implies not wanting to live).
*   **Emotional markers:** ""I hate cooking, I hate cleaning, I hate taking care of myself"", ""tired and exhausted"", ""irreparably fucked up my brain"", ""don't know where I want to go and what future I may or may not have"", ""don't know anything anymore"", ""depressed"". These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions (suicide-related):** None described.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""constantly contemplate suicide"" is an active acknowledgement of suicidal thoughts. ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" expresses a direct wish for non-existence. The repeated ""I don't want to anymore"" in context points to a desire to end their current state of suffering/existence.
*   **Passive experience:** The contemplation is presented as an ongoing, active state (""constantly contemplate""), not an intrusive thought the writer is fighting against.
*   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of the suicidal desire. The phrase ""I hope I'll get out of this soon"" refers to getting out of the *depressed state* or the *contemplation*, not a rejection of the *desire to die*. It does not state ""I contemplate suicide but I don't want to do it."" The statement ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" is a clear expression of desire for non-existence, not a rejected thought.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** Describes past feelings and experiences (""I used to have dreams..."", ""I used to love making shit...""). No past suicide attempts.
*   **Present intent:** ""constantly contemplate suicide"" (ongoing present state). ""I don't want to anymore"" (current feeling). ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" (current belief/desire).
*   **Future ideation:** ""I don't know where I want to go and what future I may or may not have."" ""I hope I'll get out of this soon. But maybe I won't. And that's life too."" This indicates uncertainty about the future and a lack of hope for improvement, but no specific future suicide plans.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   Specific method/preparation: No.
    *   Immediate timeline: No (""tonight"", ""right now"", etc. are absent).

    *   This aligns with the definition of IDEATION.

    *   While there is significant distress, it is not *only* distress. There are explicit references to ""contemplate suicide"" and a desire for non-existence (""not be here at all"").
    *   The thoughts are not explicitly rejected in the way required for an ""Indicator"" downgrade (e.g., ""I don't actually want to do it"").

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**

2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable (no immediacy).

*   **Future ideation:** While ""forever"" is future, the *possession* of the means and the current desire indicate a present, actionable intent.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **Start here →**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? →** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""I wanna go sleep forever"").
    *   **Specific method:** Yes (specific medications and quantities).
    *   **Preparation:** Yes (""I have 58 pcs...""). The possession of specific, large quantities of medication constitutes preparation and capability.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** While not explicitly ""tonight"" or ""now"", the combination of explicit intent, specific method, and *possession* of the means makes the intent actionable and immediate in terms of capability. This meets the criteria for ""Behavior"" where ""Specific method stated"" and ""Preparation evidence"" are key. The presence of the means makes the intent actionable without needing an explicit ""tonight"".

**Category Definition Check:**
*   **Behavior** (Intent + Capability):
    *   ""Specific method stated: pills"" - Yes, specific drugs and quantities.
    *   ""Preparation evidence: bought pills"" - Yes, ""I have"" implies possession, which is a concrete step of preparation.
    *   ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"" - While not explicitly stated, the *presence of the means* makes the intent actionable and capable of being carried out imminently. This is a critical factor for Behavior.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** The possession of the means makes the intent actionable and effectively imminent.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Yes.

Based on the strong explicit intent, specific method, and evidence of preparation (possession of means), this falls under the 'Behavior' category.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I don't want to bail out anymore."", ""I have to do it."", ""I should've done it a long time ago."", ""I want this to end."" These show strong active desire and perceived necessity.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""I can't do it."" (momentary feeling of inability, but immediately overridden by ""I have to do it"").
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""I don't want to traumatize anyone."" and ""I am scared."" These indicate ambivalence and fear, but not a rejection of the overall suicidal desire or intent. The dominant intent is still to act.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times."", ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."", ""I should've done it a long time ago."" (clear past attempts).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   According to the ""Attempt"" definition: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" and ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped')"" and ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned"". This perfectly matches the description.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes, all statements are about the writer's actions and feelings.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since past attempts are described, this is the highest applicable category.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** While there's present intent, the explicit past attempts take precedence due to the temporal hierarchy rule.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** While there's ambivalence (""I am scared"", ""don't want to traumatize anyone""), it's not a full rejection of suicidal desire, and critically, the *past attempts* are what drive the classification here, regardless of current ambivalence.
*   **Output exactly one:** Will output 'attempt'.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post contains clear and explicit descriptions of past suicide attempts (""tried and bailed out multiple times,"" ""tried with a knife. It didn't work.""). According to the framework's decision tree and the definition of 'Attempt', any description of a past concrete action of self-harm with suicidal intent, including interrupted or unsuccessful attempts, classifies the post as 'Attempt'. This overrules any concurrent ideation or behavioral elements.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""attempt properly again"" directly refers to a past suicide attempt and the potential for a future one.
    *   Indirect death references: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow.""
    *   Emotional markers: ""depressed enough"", ""Tired of being alone"" (hopelessness, despair).
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: ""attempt properly again"" clearly indicates a past suicide attempt.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" shows active desire for non-existence. The statement about a future attempt is presented as a probable consequence of depression.
    *   Passive experience: Not applicable.
    *   Rejection noted? ""But I will, as always"" is a statement of expectation, not a rejection of the *desire* to not wake up. The desire for non-existence is present.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""attempt properly again"" explicitly refers to a past attempt.
    *   Present intent: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow."" (desire for immediate non-existence).
    *   Future ideation: ""that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again."" (future potential).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → YES. The phrase ""attempt properly again"" directly describes a past suicide attempt.

    *   **IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
        *   1. Writer-focused: Yes.
        *   2. Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since a past attempt is explicitly mentioned, this takes precedence over any present ideation or future behavior contemplation.
        *   3. Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as 'Attempt' is the highest category.
        *   4. Rejection downgrade: ""But I will, as always"" is not a rejection of the suicidal desire, but an expectation of survival. However, the presence of a past attempt is the dominant factor.
        *   5. Output exactly one: 'attempt'.

    *   Based on the ""Attempt"" definition (""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"", ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"", ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned"", ""Clarification: 'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt""), the post clearly falls into this category due to the explicit mention of a past attempt.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""looking for someone to kill me""
    *   Indirect death references: ""hide my body so that my family will never find out"", ""never get found again"", ""chop me up""
    *   Emotional markers: Implied extreme despair, but not explicitly stated emotions like hopelessness or worthlessness.
    *   Specific methods: ""kill me"", ""chop me up"" (as a means to dispose of the body, implying death). The method is being killed by another person.
    *   Preparations: ""looking for someone to kill me"" is a clear act of seeking means/preparation.
    *   Past actions: None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""I am looking for someone to kill me"", ""I am happy for u to chop me up"". This is a clear, active, and owned desire for death.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: Yes, ""I am looking for someone to kill me"" indicates a current, active search and intent.
    *   Future ideation: No, it's an active, present pursuit.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""looking for someone to kill me"".
        *   Specific method: The method is being killed by another person. While not a self-harm method, it's a specific way the user intends to die.
        *   Preparation evidence: ""looking for someone"" is a direct action to acquire the means/agent for death. This constitutes preparation.
        *   Immediate timeline: Not explicitly ""tonight"" or ""now"", but the active ""looking for someone"" implies a current, actionable pursuit rather than just a passive thought.

    *   **Category Definitions Check:**
        *   **Indicator**: Ruled out. There is active suicidal desire and a search for means, not just distress or rejected thoughts.
        *   **Ideation**: Ruled out. The user is not just expressing a wish to die, but actively ""looking for someone"" to facilitate it, which crosses into seeking capability/preparation.
        *   **Behavior**: This category fits. The post states a specific method (being killed by someone) and shows preparation evidence (""looking for someone"" to carry out the act). The active search for an agent to kill them clearly falls under ""Intent + Capability"" or ""Preparation evidence"".

    *   **IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
        1.  Writer-focused: Yes, the post is about the writer's intent.
        2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
        3.  Immediacy trumps: The active ""looking for someone"" implies a current, actionable intent beyond mere ideation.
        4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection of thoughts.
        5.  Output exactly one: Will output one category.

The active search for someone to kill them, combined with the explicit desire for death and specific instructions for body disposal, indicates an intent to act and a search for the means to do so. This aligns with the 'Behavior' category's definition of ""Intent + Capability"" and ""Preparation evidence.""

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicidal thoughts"", ""fantasizing about my death"", ""some days I consider it"" (referring to suicide).
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""fed up"", ""fighting down"", ""rock bottom lows"", ""crap"". Indicates distress, exhaustion, and despair.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.

    *   **Past actions:** ""10 years that I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts."" (Describes past *thoughts*, not *actions*). ""Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here."" (Explicitly states no past attempt).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""some days I consider it"" (suggests brief active consideration).
    *   **Passive experience:** ""something just snaps on in my head and then I'm fantasizing about my death"" (describes intrusive thoughts).
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** YES, very strongly. ""I fight to suppress them"", ""Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here"", ""I have no desire to die."" This is a crucial element.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""10 years that I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts."" (Historical context of thoughts).
    *   **Present intent:** ""Every fucking day, something just snaps on in my head and then I'm fantasizing about my death."" (Ongoing intrusive thoughts). ""some days I consider it."" (Present, but immediately rejected intent).
    *   **Future ideation:** None.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. The post explicitly states ""Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here"" and describes fighting *thoughts*, not *actions*.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. While ""some days I consider it"" could be seen as intent, it lacks method, preparation, or immediacy, and is heavily qualified by rejection.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. The core definition of Ideation requires an ""Explicit wish to die."" The post explicitly states, ""I have no desire to die."" The ""some days I consider it"" is presented as a consequence of being ""fed up with fighting,"" rather than a genuine desire to act, and is immediately countered by the explicit rejection.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes.
        *   ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"": ""I'm fed up with it"", ""rock bottom lows"", ""fighting this crap"". (Fits)
        *   ""Metaphorical death references"": Not strictly metaphorical, but ""fantasizing about my death"" is presented as an intrusive thought.
        *   ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"": ""I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts"", ""something just snaps on in my head and then I'm fantasizing about my death. I fight to suppress them"", ""I have no desire to die."" (Strong fit)
        *   ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"": This is the most critical point. Despite the presence of suicidal thoughts and fleeting consideration, the explicit statement ""I have no desire to die"" and the emphasis on fighting and suppressing these thoughts means there's no *active suicidal desire* as defined for Ideation.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable, as no attempt or behavior is present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable, no immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** ""I have no desire to die."" This rule is paramount here and pushes the classification to Indicator.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

Based on the strong and repeated rejection of suicidal desire (""I have no desire to die,"" ""I fight to suppress them""), despite the presence of intrusive suicidal thoughts, the post best fits the ""Indicator"" category.

I was emotionally neglected by my parents, and searching for the love and attention I never got is the only thing keeping my alive. Every thing I do is controlled by this. It usually starts by seeing someone getting praised for something, which leads to me thinking that I need to be able to do/ have these things to be loved. Every time I see things as simple as a drawing, just gets me more and more depressed. I can't go to a therapist or something like that, because my mom's mad at me for being even sad in the slightest. I can't talk a single word about mental health at all, without being scared that she will scream at me another time. I feel like I'm unimportant. Other people have problems much worse than mine.

    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** Yes, ""but I just can't."", ""The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest. I don't know why, but I just. can't."" This indicates an inability to act, not a rejection of the desire itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** ""wish to end my life"", ""end all this"" – current desire.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future timing.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent is present (""wish to end my life"").
        *   However, there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. Thus, this path does not lead to BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""wish to end my life"", ""end all this"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes (no method, no preparation, no immediate timeline).
        *   This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, analysis is solely on the writer's statements.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt or behavior is described.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as no immediate timeline is stated.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator. The post states ""I just can't"" (referring to inability to act), not ""I don't want to"" (referring to desire). While a significant barrier, this specific wording (""I can't"" vs. ""I don't want to"") does not trigger the downgrade to Indicator based on the strict wording of this rule. The explicit desire to end life (""wish to end my life"") remains.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will ensure this.

**Conclusion:**
The post clearly expresses an ""explicit wish to die"" (""wish to end my life"", ""end all this"") which fits the definition of **Ideation**. There is no specific plan, method, or immediate timeline that would escalate it to Behavior. While the user states an inability to harm themselves (""I just can't""), this is a statement about capability/action, not a rejection of the suicidal desire itself, and thus does not trigger the ""rejection downgrade"" rule as specified.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""I don't want to live this again"" - This expresses a profound desire to escape current suffering, which *could* imply a desire for death, but it's not a direct or explicit death reference. It's more about not wanting to *experience* the current situation.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""lost control"", ""can't breathe"", ""want to cry"", ""want to scream help please"". These are strong indicators of overwhelming distress, hopelessness, and pain.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I don't want to live this again"" is an active statement of desire to escape the current state.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal of suicidal thoughts. The ""help please"" suggests a desire for intervention and relief from the current distress, but not a rejection of a suicidal thought itself, as no explicit suicidal thought was stated.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I don't want to live this again"" refers to the current overwhelming experience.
    *   **Future ideation:** No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" is *not* an ""explicit suicide intent"" as defined (e.g., ""I want to die"", ""I want to kill myself""). It's an expression of extreme distress and a desire for the current suffering to end, but it doesn't explicitly state a desire for death itself.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No explicit suicide desire (""want to die"", ""don't deserve to live""). ""I don't want to live this again"" falls short of this explicit desire. It's about not wanting to *experience* the current state.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This fits. The post primarily conveys general unhappiness, hopelessness, and despair (""lost control"", ""can't breathe"", ""want to cry"", ""want to scream help please""). The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" is a strong expression of distress, akin to a metaphorical ""want to disappear"" or ""want this to end,"" rather than an explicit suicidal desire. It expresses a wish to escape a *situation* or *feeling*, not necessarily life itself. There are NO expressions of active suicidal desire.

    *   **Category Definitions Check:**
        *   **Indicator:** ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" (Yes). ""Metaphorical death references ('want to disappear')"" (The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" is close to this, expressing a desire to escape the current state rather than explicit death). ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" (Yes, it lacks ""I want to die"" or similar).
        *   **Ideation:** Requires ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"". This is not present.

    Therefore, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category due to strong distress signals without explicit suicidal intent or a direct wish to die.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out by explicit suicidal desire and preparation.

Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

    *   **Specific methods:** The post *asks* ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body..."", which is a question about a method, not a statement of a chosen specific method (e.g., ""I'm going to take pills"").

        *   **Imminent timeline:** No ""tonight,"" ""right now,"" ""this weekend.""
        *   *Conclusion for 'b':* No. The question about *how* to kill oneself without leaving a body indicates a desire to find a method, but not that a specific method has been chosen or that immediate action is planned. This falls short of the ""Behavior"" criteria.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   **Explicit wish to die:** Yes, ""I just. Want. To die.""
        *   **Non-actionable methods:** The question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body..."" fits here. It's a desire for a particular *type* of death (no body), but without a concrete, actionable plan or method identified. It's a search for a method, not a declaration of one.
        *   **No preparation or immediate timeline:** Confirmed.
        *   *Conclusion for 'c':* Yes, this fits perfectly.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear, active, explicit suicidal desire.

Based on the systematic analysis, particularly the distinction between asking *how* to find a method versus stating a specific method/plan/imminent timeline, the post falls into the ""Ideation"" category.

A lot of times I feel like I wasn't meant for this world. I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy. My view of the world is growing more and more dim and I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is. Everything here is lame and it just makes me sick and I don't really see a future for myself. In the end, I'm just going to keep disappointing those who care till everyone hates me.

These phrases collectively express a strong desire to end life.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""be free from it all,"" ""eternal void,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" (implies active intervention to end life).
    *   **Emotional markers:** Hopelessness (""No point in it all,"" ""won't get anywhere,"" ""lose hope,"" ""dim,"" ""no future""), worthlessness (""disappointing those who care""), despair (""hate being trapped,"" ""sick"").
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer clearly owns these thoughts and expresses a desire for an end to life (""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""One last push is all I need,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally""). There is no indication of these thoughts being intrusive or rejected.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I need something to really push me over the edge."" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all."" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" These phrases indicate a current state of readiness and a desire for an immediate end, rejecting the natural course of life. While not a specific time like ""tonight,"" the rejection of waiting and the readiness for ""one last push"" convey a strong sense of immediacy.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""don't really see a future for myself"" is a statement of absence of future, not a future plan.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, clearly expressed.
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** No specific method or preparation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** The phrases ""One last push is all I need"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" strongly convey an immediate *readiness* for action and an active desire to *not* wait for death to occur naturally. This aligns with the ""Expressions of immediate intent"" clarification for the **Behavior** category, even without a specific time like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The active rejection of waiting pushes it beyond mere ideation, indicating a state on the brink of action.

    *   Comparing with Ideation: Ideation requires ""No preparation or immediate timeline."" This post, through ""One last push"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally,"" implies a strong sense of immediate readiness and a rejection of a non-immediate timeline, thus moving it beyond Ideation.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: No. The writer is discussing the *reasons* why people commit suicide and expressing empathy (""People who commit suicide are not weak""). There is no statement like ""I want to commit suicide"" or ""I am going to end my life."" The ""we've"" is a collective ""we"" referring to humanity or people who experience distress, not a personal declaration of suicidal intent.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? No personal suicidal thoughts are presented to be rejected.

    *   **Indirect death references:** ""leave this world forever"", ""be dead"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** Anger, defiance, resentment (""fuck everyone I knew"", ""giant middle finger"", ""ain't having any of their shit""). This indicates significant distress and a desire for a final, defiant act.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned (e.g., no mention of acquiring means, writing a note for *others* to read, scouting locations for the act itself). The ""giant middle finger"" is a desired *outcome/message* after the act, not a preparation for the act itself.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The phrasing ""If I kill myself"" is conditional, but the subsequent text (""Im giving nobody nothing. fuck everyone I knew. I just wanna leave a giant middle finger before I leave this world forever"") clearly articulates a strong, active desire to die and a specific motivation/message associated with that act. It's not presented as an intrusive thought or rejected. The ""I just wanna leave"" indicates a personal desire.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** The desire (""I just wanna leave"") is present. The ""if"" makes it somewhat future-oriented, but the active consideration of the consequences and the strong desire to ""leave this world forever"" indicates current ideation.
    *   **Future ideation:** The ""if"" suggests a non-specific future timing, as there's no ""tonight"" or ""now"".

This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, it goes beyond general distress or metaphors. It explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever"" as a personal action being considered, and there is no rejection of these thoughts.

He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

The post explicitly describes a past event: ""I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning since it was pretty deep and I didn't know how to swim. So some how she convince me not to."" This fits the 'Attempt' definition: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent. Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped')"". The fact that the attempt was interrupted does not negate its classification as an 'Attempt'.

    *   **IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
        1.  Writer-focused: Yes, all ""I"" statements.

        3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as 'Attempt' is present. The future plan for 18th birthday is not immediate.
        4.  Rejection downgrade: The rejection (""she convince me not to"") applies to the *past* event, which is still classified as an attempt because it was an *interrupted* action. The current/future ideation has no rejection.

    *   Active endorsement: ""It's like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it's now ok to try."" This is a clear expression of a shift in perspective, where suicide is now considered a viable option for the self. It's an active consideration of the *action* of suicide.
    *   Passive experience: ""I keep thinking about it.""
    *   Rejection noted?: ""But I just don't want to think like this anymore."" This is a rejection of the *thoughts* themselves, indicating distress, but it does *not* explicitly disavow the underlying sentiment or cognitive shift (""it's now ok to try""). The ""Irreducible Rule 4: Rejection downgrade"" applies if the *intent* is rejected, not just the thoughts. Here, the *desire* to try is not explicitly rejected, only the intrusive nature of the thoughts.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

    *   Present intent: ""Since then I keep thinking about it."" ""It's like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it's now ok to try."" This is a *current* cognitive shift making suicide a present consideration.
    *   Future ideation: None explicitly.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No. The attempt mentioned is by ""someone who I know."" So, not ATTEMPT.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?
        *   Explicit suicide intent: ""it's now ok to try"" strongly suggests intent or a strong consideration of the *action* of suicide.
        *   Specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline: None are present. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior requires ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight')"", which is not present.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?
        *   ""It's now ok to try"" fits ""Explicit wish to die"" in a broader sense, as it signifies an active desire to *consider* or *engage* in the act of suicide, which is a step beyond mere passive ideation or distress. It is an active suicidal desire.
        *   There is no plan or immediacy. This aligns perfectly with IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? No. The phrase ""it's now ok to try"" goes beyond mere distress or rejected thoughts. It indicates an active consideration of suicide as an option for the self.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post describes a significant cognitive shift where the user now views suicide as a viable option (""it's now ok to try""). This is an active suicidal desire, moving beyond general distress or rejected thoughts. However, there is no mention of a specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. The rejection (""I just don't want to think like this anymore"") applies to the *thoughts*, not an explicit disavowal of the *desire* to try. This fits the definition of **Ideation** perfectly.

    *   **Indirect death references:** ""disconnected from life in itself already"", ""everything seems so far out of my touch, like it's not even real"" (these indicate severe distress and detachment, contributing to risk context).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself."" This is an active contemplation of future suicidal action, linked to a desired outcome (control).
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable here.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of the suicidal thoughts or actions. The ""without thinking"" suggests impulsivity rather than disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""nearly killing myself one night"" – This describes a past action with suicidal intent.
    *   **Present intent:** No immediate plans (""doing it tonight"", ""right now"") are stated.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking."" – This is a future possibility, not an immediate plan.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → **YES**. The phrase ""nearly killing myself one night"" directly describes a past action taken towards self-harm with suicidal intent. According to the ""Attempt"" definition: ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" and ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"". This fits.
    *   **IRREDUCIBLE RULE 2: Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation.** Since a past attempt is described, this takes precedence over the future ideation (""step off a building or over a bridge"").

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I want to take myself out"" clearly indicates active suicidal desire and ownership of the thought.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No. The fear is about the *pain* of a method, not a rejection of the desire to die. The plea ""what do i do, please? i just need it to stop"" is a request for a *painless* way to end it, not a request for help to *not* end it.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

The concern about pain (""scared it'll be painful"") and the plea for ""what do I do, please?"" aligns with seeking a non-actionable way to die. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". This is true for the post.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific method, no preparation, and no imminent timeline. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior (""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"") is not met as there's no immediacy.

This fits the ""Behavior"" definition's ""Preparation evidence"" criterion.

    *   This post clearly indicates explicit suicide intent coupled with a concrete preparatory action (writing farewell emails). This aligns with the ""Behavior"" category.

**Final Check against Definitions and Rules:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to active intent and preparation.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there's specific preparation, not just a wish or non-actionable thoughts. The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation states it becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with immediacy or preparation.

""Preparation evidence: ...wrote note"" (emails serve this purpose) and ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"" (the intent to send emails *before* acting, and the desire not to ""wuss out,"" shows a concrete plan in motion).

   - Indirect death references: ""how people can want to live?"", ""how they actually find important to stay alive?"", ""I have 60 fucking years left"", ""I have to live 60 years more"". These refer to the burden or lack of appeal of living, not indirect references to *suicide*.
   - Emotional markers: Cynicism, weariness, a sense of burden (""60 fucking years left"", ""have to live 60 years more""), and a past negative experience (""it wasn't really good""). This indicates general distress and hopelessness about life.
   - Specific methods: None.
   - Preparations: None.
   - Past actions: None related to suicide.

2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):
   - Active endorsement: No. The post asks *how others* can want to live, implying the writer does not find value in it, but it does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself."" It's a philosophical questioning of life's value, not a direct statement of suicidal intent.
   - Passive experience: Not applicable.
   - Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal of suicidal thoughts, but crucially, no explicit endorsement of them either.

   - Past focus: ""it wasn't really good"" (referring to past life experience).
   - Present intent: No present intent to die by suicide. The questions are about the current understanding of why people live.
   - Future ideation: The discussion about ""60 fucking years left"" is about the *burden* of future living, not a future plan for suicide.

4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:
   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? → No explicit suicide intent (""I want to die"", ""I will kill myself"").
   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? → No explicit desire to die. The post questions *why others* want to live, implying the writer doesn't see the value, but it does not state ""I want to die.""
   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? → Yes. The post expresses general unhappiness, despair, and a profound questioning of the value of life, which falls under ""distress without actionable suicide intent."" It lacks any active suicidal desire, specific plans, or past attempts. The questioning of ""how people can want to live?"" and the burden of ""60 fucking years left"" signify a deep sense of despair or lack of motivation to live, but not an active desire to end life by suicide.

Final check against definitions:
*   **Indicator**: ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" - Fits. ""Metaphorical death references ('want to disappear')"" - While not ""want to disappear,"" the questioning of why one would want to live and the burden of life are akin to a general expression of not wanting to be in the current state, without being an explicit suicide wish. ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" - This is key and holds true.

This post articulates a profound sense of despair and lack of purpose or motivation to continue living, but it stops short of expressing an active desire to die by suicide. It is a questioning of the value of life itself, rather than a statement of intent to end one's own life.

385,"It's never a good idea to threaten to call the cops on someone who's passive suicidal, teetering on the edge of being suicidal. Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""passive suicidal"", ""being suicidal"", ""suicide by cop"", ""suicide""
    *   Indirect death references: ""teetering on the edge"" (metaphorical for being close to suicidal state)
    *   Emotional markers: ""Why would people be so counterproductive?"" (Expresses frustration/disbelief about others' actions, not personal despair related to suicide)
    *   Specific methods: ""suicide by cop"" (mentioned as a hypothetical outcome for *others*, not as a personal plan)
    *   Preparations: None by the writer.
    *   Past actions: None by the writer.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: No. The writer is discussing a hypothetical situation involving *other people* (""someone who's passive suicidal"", ""they may just think""). The writer is *not* expressing their own suicidal thoughts or intentions.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? N/A, as no personal suicidal thoughts are expressed by the writer.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No personal past actions.
    *   Present intent: No personal present intent.
    *   Future ideation: No personal future ideation. The post is a general commentary/warning.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No (by the writer).
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? No (by the writer). The mention of ""suicide by cop"" is in a hypothetical, third-person context.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? No (by the writer).
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? Yes. The post contains references to suicide and related concepts, but these are discussed in an observational, cautionary, and frustrated tone, not as an expression of the writer's own suicidal ideation or intent. The distress expressed is about others' counterproductive actions, not personal suicidal despair.

**Conclusion based on Category Definitions and Irreducible Rules:**
The post discusses suicide and suicidal individuals but does not express any personal suicidal intent, desire, plan, or past action from the writer. It's a commentary on a social dynamic. Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category as it mentions suicide-related concepts without active suicidal desire from the writer.

386,"Doctor says I might have Type 1 Diabetes, and I had a plan in mind ever since. The visit was recent, but the doctor says I might have type 1 diabetes.

Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life and never told anyone because I hate being a burden. My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens and I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens. Getting the pens is too much of a hassle though. Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump if my condition goes south quick and, with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go.

Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""the way I choose to go"" (referring to suicide), ""Thought about doing it a couple times"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** N/A.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""depressed for most of my life"", ""hate being a burden"".
    *   **Specific methods:** ""insulin pens"" (considered but rejected due to hassle), ""pump with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" (identified as the chosen method).
    *   **Preparations:** ""Getting the pens is too much of a hassle though."" (Indicates a *lack* of preparation with pens, and a preference for a future, easier method). No active preparation for the pump as it's not yet acquired.
    *   **Past actions:** ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up."" (Past *ideation*, not an attempt). ""almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens"" (Past medical event, not a suicide attempt). ""had a plan in mind ever since"" (Past ideation).

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""think that might be the way I choose to go."" (Clear active endorsement of suicide via the pump). ""Had a couple ideas for how to do it"" (Active consideration).
    *   **Passive experience:** N/A.
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up."" This is a rejection of *past action due to logistical difficulty*, not a rejection of the *desire* to die or the *future plan* with the pump. The desire and the specific future plan remain.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""had a plan in mind ever since"", ""Thought about doing it a couple times"".
    *   **Present intent:** The intent to use the pump is present, but contingent on a future event.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump if my condition goes south quick and... think that might be the way I choose to go."" (Conditional future plan/ideation).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The post explicitly states ""didn't"" do it in the past due to hassle, and the ""shock"" was a medical event.
        *   *Conclusion:* Not ATTEMPT.

    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""think that might be the way I choose to go.""
        *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""pump with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button."" This is a specific method.
        *   **Preparation:** No *current* preparation. The pump is not yet acquired; its acquisition is contingent on a future medical development (""if my condition goes south quick"").
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No. The plan is conditional and future-oriented (""if my condition goes south quick""). There is no ""tonight"" or ""right now.""

        *   *Re-evaluation for Behavior:* While a specific method is identified, the *means* (the pump) are not currently possessed, and the *timeline* is not immediate. The plan is not *currently actionable*. Therefore, it does not meet the ""Behavior"" criteria for current capability or immediacy.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without actionable plan/immediacy?**
        *   **Explicit wish to die:** Yes, ""think that might be the way I choose to go.""
        *   **Non-actionable methods:** The method (insulin pump overdose) is specific. However, the *plan* is not *actionable* at present because the means (the pump) are not available and are contingent on a future event. This aligns with ""without actionable plan"" in the context of *current* capability.
        *   **No preparation or immediate timeline:** This fits perfectly.

        *   *Key boundary check:* It does *not* become Behavior because it lacks ""tonight"" or ""now.""

    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is clear active suicide intent and a specific, albeit contingent, method.

    Based on the systematic analysis, particularly the lack of current means/preparation and immediate timeline, despite a specific method being identified, the post best fits **Ideation**. The plan is contingent on a future event (getting the pump) and is not currently actionable.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right?

    *   **Emotional markers:** High levels of stress, despair, hopelessness, feeling pathetic, confusion, isolation (""My 'friends' have all left me""), feeling things are ""useless"" and ""desolate"".
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.

    *   **Past actions:** No past attempts mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I'm finally considering suicide"" is a direct, active statement of suicidal ideation. ""I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents"" indicates a conditional desire for death, where the parents are the only current deterrent, not a rejection of the thought itself. The final ""Why do I give a shit"" further questions the value of life.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not passive. The thoughts are actively being considered and entertained.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The only ""rejection"" is the external factor of parents. This is a *reason not to act*, not an internal disavowal of the suicidal thought itself. The thought is still present and considered.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it"" (describes a past *lack* of ideation).
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm finally considering suicide"" is a current state of mind. The distress and questioning of life's value are present.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future plans or timing for suicide.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. (Rule: Attempt is highest hierarchy, but not present).
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""considering suicide"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   *Conclusion for b): Does not meet criteria for BEHAVIOR.*
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, ""I'm finally considering suicide"" clearly states this. The conditional ""wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents"" reinforces a desire that is only externally constrained.
        *   Non-actionable methods: Not applicable, as no methods are mentioned, which fits the ""without plan"" criteria.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes, no plan or immediacy mentioned.
        *   *Key boundary*: Not paired with ""tonight"" or ""now"".
        *   *Conclusion for c): This fits IDEATION.*
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts →
        *   Is it *ONLY* distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? No, because there is explicit ""considering suicide"" and active, albeit conditional, desire. The ""Rejection downgrade"" rule (""I don't actually want to"") does not apply here, as the statement about parents is a *reason not to act*, not a rejection of the underlying suicidal desire.

Based on the explicit statement ""I'm finally considering suicide"" and the lack of a specific plan, method, or immediate timeline, the post best fits the ""Ideation"" category.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

*   **Passive experience:** Not present.
*   **Rejection noted?** ""My fucking hand wouldn't move. I couldn't breath... then I put down my knife."" This describes an *interruption* or *aborted* action, not a rejection of the suicidal *desire*.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** The entire post describes a recently completed or aborted action: ""I just attempted"", ""I was right there"", ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"", ""then I put down my knife"", ""I almost committed"".

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   Start here →
*   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → Yes, ""I just attempted to end my life."" and ""I almost committed."" and ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"" (indicating self-harm with suicidal intent). This clearly falls under the 'Attempt' definition, specifically including ""interrupted/aborted attempts"".

**Category Definition Check (Attempt):**
*   ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"": Yes, ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"" combined with ""I just attempted to end my life.""
*   ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"": Yes, ""My fucking hand wouldn't move. I couldn't breath... then I put down my knife."" perfectly fits this.
*   ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned"": Yes, this is the highest category.
*   ""Clarification: 'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt"": Yes, ""I just attempted to end my life."" directly matches this.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, all statements are about the writer's own actions and feelings.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. The post describes an attempt, which is the highest.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as the event is described in the past.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The ""rejection"" (stopping the act) is part of an *interrupted attempt*, which is explicitly included in the 'Attempt' category. It is not a rejection of the underlying suicidal desire.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever.

        *   Non-actionable methods: No specific method mentioned.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Confirmed. The statement ""but I don't"" (have the guts) reinforces the absence of an actionable plan or immediacy.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because there is clear active suicidal desire, not merely distress or rejected thoughts. The ""but I don't"" refers to capability, not rejection of the desire.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

**Category Definitions Check:**

*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is a specific method, preparation, and an imminent timeline, not just a general wish.

    *   Emotional markers: ""what the fuck"" (frustration, anger at being prevented).
    *   Specific methods: None stated.
    *   Preparations: ""my plan"" implies preparations, though details are not given. The fact that a ""friend snitched"" on the plan suggests it was concrete enough to be perceived as actionable.
    *   Past actions: None described by the writer.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""my plan to kill myself"" indicates active ownership of the suicidal intent.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? No. The post expresses frustration about being *prevented* from acting on the plan, not a rejection of the plan itself.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: The ""snitching"" happened in the past, regarding a plan that was current or imminent at that time.
    *   Present intent: The frustration is present, and the metaphor of ""preventing someone to get euthanized"" suggests the desire to carry out the plan is still active, even if currently thwarted.

The fact that a friend ""snitched"" on it and family is ""watching"" further supports that the plan was perceived as serious and actionable.
        *   Immediate timeline: No explicit immediate timeline (""tonight"", ""right now"").

    *   **Evaluation against definitions:**
        *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. There is active suicidal desire and a ""plan,"" not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
        *   **Ideation:** Incorrect. While there's no immediate timeline, the presence of ""my plan"" moves this beyond simple ""wish to die"" or non-actionable methods without preparation. The definition of Ideation explicitly states ""No preparation."" A ""plan"" inherently involves preparation.
        *   **Behavior:** This fits best. While no specific method is stated, ""my plan to kill myself"" implies a level of concrete intent and preparation. The fact that a friend intervened and family is now watching indicates the plan was considered serious and actionable, aligning with the ""Preparation evidence"" aspect of the Behavior category, even if details aren't explicitly listed. The post describes a concrete, actionable intent that was serious enough to warrant intervention.
        *   **Attempt:** Incorrect. No past completed action described.

These phrases strongly convey an inability to continue living and a diminishing fear of death.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""struggling,"" ""light has disappeared,"" ""severe anxiety,"" ""worthless person,"" ""done me more harm than god,"" ""no results."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being trapped.
    *   **Specific methods:** None stated.
    *   **Preparations:** ""I wrote a note today."" This is a direct, concrete preparation.
    *   **Past actions:** ""end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital."" This describes a past mental health crisis leading to hospitalization, but not explicitly a past suicide *attempt* (i.e., self-harm with suicidal intent). The context was ""reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to.""

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The phrases ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more,"" and ""lately it feels like I just can't continue"" all represent active, personal endorsement of suicidal thoughts/desire to end suffering. The act of writing a note further solidifies active intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit rejection. The statement ""I think this is my last chance at asking for help"" indicates a final plea *before* potentially acting, rather than a rejection of the suicidal thoughts themselves. The loss of fear of non-existence is the opposite of rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""I wrote a note today"" (action completed today, but preparation for future intent), ""last night I reached out for help,"" ""in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years.""

These indicate a current, ongoing state of being unable to cope, combined with a recent preparatory action (writing the note).
    *   **Future ideation:** Implied by the inability to continue and the preparation, but no specific future timing is given.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The ER visit was a mental health crisis/help-seeking, not described as self-harm with suicidal intent.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, strongly implied by ""can't keep going like this,"" ""fear of non existence doesn't deter me,"" and the overall tone of despair and finality.
        *   **Specific method:** No.
        *   **Preparation:** Yes, ""I wrote a note today."" This is a clear act of preparation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No explicit ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but the combination of ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this"" and the *recent action* of writing a note today suggests a current, active, and critical state.

    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of explicit suicide intent combined with a concrete act of preparation (""I wrote a note today"") fits the definition of **Behavior**. It moves beyond mere ideation because an actionable step has been taken.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving.

    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer explicitly states ""I deserve to die,"" ""I want someone to stomp me out,"" and ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat."" These are active desires.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** The post states ""I have no plans and I don't think I'd succeed anyway."" This is a statement about lack of *plan* or *capability*, not a rejection of the *desire* to die. The desire remains strong and active.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** No explicit ""doing it tonight"" or ""right now."" The post explicitly states ""I have no plans.""
    *   **Future ideation:** The desires are present and ongoing, but without an immediate timeline or personal plan for execution. The methods are expressed as desired outcomes, often wished to be inflicted by others.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""I deserve to die,"" ""deserve a bullet,"" ""wish someone would slit my throat"").
        *   **Specific method:** Yes (""bullet in my head,"" ""slit my fucking throat"").

        *   **Immediate timeline:** No, the post explicitly states ""I have no plans.""

    *   **Analysis against definitions:**
        *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of active suicidal desire and specific methods, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.
        *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.
        *   **Behavior:** The definition states ""Intent + Capability."" While there is clear intent, the writer explicitly states ""I have no plans and I don't think I'd succeed anyway."" This directly contradicts the ""capability"" aspect of Behavior (in terms of personal action/plan). While specific methods are mentioned, the lack of a plan and the framing of the methods being wished upon them by *others* (rather than self-inflicted action) means it doesn't meet the ""actionable plan"" or ""imminent timeline"" criteria that typically push it to Behavior. The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation states it ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"", implying that without immediacy, it remains Ideation.
        *   **Ideation:** This category is defined as ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan."" This aligns perfectly with the post's explicit suicidal desire (""I deserve to die,"" ""deserve a bullet,"" ""wish someone would slit my throat"") combined with the explicit statement ""I have no plans."" While the methods are specific, the lack of an actionable plan by the writer for *themselves* keeps it in Ideation. The desire for specific, violent methods makes it severe ideation, but ideation nonetheless.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        *   1. Writer-focused: The desires are the writer's, even if they wish others would act on them.
        *   2. Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable.
        *   3. Immediacy trumps: No immediacy here.
        *   4. Rejection downgrade: Not a rejection of desire, but of plan/capability, so no downgrade to Indicator.

    Based on the framework, particularly the explicit statement ""I have no plans"" and the definition of Ideation as ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan,"" this post fits best into the Ideation category.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""But the second they're gone, so am I."" This is an active, albeit conditional, statement of intent to end their life. ""I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness"" implies a desire for an end to current suffering.
    *   **Passive experience:** No ""my brain tells me"" phrasing.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal (""but I won't do it""). The conditionality (""But the second they're gone"") is a *condition* for the action, not a rejection of the underlying desire.

    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""But the second they're gone, so am I"" is an explicit, conditional statement of intent to die by suicide.
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (""tonight"", ""right now""). The timeline is conditional on parents being ""gone,"" which is not immediate.
        *   *Conclusion for b):* Lacks specific method/preparation and immediate timeline. This rules out BEHAVIOR.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   Yes. ""But the second they're gone, so am I"" is an explicit wish to die, conditional on an external event, without a specific plan or immediate timeline. The profound despair and feelings of worthlessness (""hideous fucking mutant,"" ""sick of this emptiness"") provide strong context for this desire.
        *   *Key boundary check*: It does not become BEHAVIOR because there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
        *   No. While there is significant distress, there is also an active, albeit conditional, expression of suicidal desire, which goes beyond mere distress or rejected thoughts.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post contains a clear, active expression of suicidal desire (""But the second they're gone, so am I"") which is conditional on a future event (parents being gone) and lacks any specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. This fits the definition of **Ideation**. It's more than just general distress (Indicator) because of the explicit conditional intent to die by suicide. It's not Behavior because there's no plan, means, or immediacy. It's not Attempt as no past action is described.

    *   **Past actions:** No past suicide attempts mentioned. ""They've been happening again for a while now"" refers to urges, not actions.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, the writer states ""suicidal ones"" and ""thinking of killing myself,"" indicating active engagement with these thoughts.
    *   **Passive experience:** While ""bad urges"" can sound passive, the subsequent confirmation of ""a plan"" indicates active intent.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** The post expresses guilt (""hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them and my sibling"") and concern for friends, but it *does not* disavow the suicidal desire or the existence of the plan. The plan is explicitly confirmed (""I have a plan but no date set kind of bad""). The guilt is about the *impact* on others, not a rejection of the intent itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""They've been happening again for a while now"" (referring to urges).
    *   **Present intent:** ""bad urges tonight"", and crucially, ""I have a plan"" (the plan exists in the present).
    *   **Future ideation:** ""no date set"" implies future, but the plan is *currently formulated*.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""suicidal ones"", ""thinking of killing myself"").
        *   **Specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline:**
            *   No specific method detailed.
            *   No immediate timeline (""no date set"").
            *   **Preparation:** The statement ""I have a plan"" directly indicates a form of preparation. While not a physical act like ""bought pills"" or ""wrote note,"" having a formulated plan is a significant step beyond mere ideation and aligns with the ""Preparation evidence"" aspect of the **Behavior** category. It implies a higher level of intent and capability than just wishing to die.

    *   **Irreducible Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade):** The guilt expressed is about the potential impact on others, not a rejection of the suicidal thoughts or the plan itself. The plan is explicitly stated as existing.

    The presence of ""I have a plan"" is the critical factor. It elevates the risk beyond simple ""Ideation"" (which lacks preparation or immediacy) into ""Behavior,"" as it signifies a concrete step in formulating how to act, even if the timing is not set and specific method details are withheld.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer acknowledges having ""suicidal thoughts"" and states they are happening ""more and more frequently."" This indicates active, recurring ideation.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not explicitly passive/intrusive; the focus is on the writer's internal experience and reluctance to disclose.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of the thoughts themselves. The writer is *lying about* the thoughts to avoid therapeutic complications, not because they don't want the thoughts or disagree with them. In fact, the increasing frequency suggests they are becoming more prominent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""if I've had suicidal thoughts"" (acknowledges past, but leads to present implications).
    *   **Present intent:** ""starts to happen more and more frequently"" (current, ongoing increase in the frequency of suicidal thoughts). ""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" (current feeling of despair/being trapped).
    *   **Future ideation:** None.

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" not attempts.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** The phrase ""suicidal thoughts... starts to happen more and more frequently"" strongly implies active suicidal desire/ideation.
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** No.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No.
        *   This does not fully meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR due to lack of method/immediacy.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   The presence and increasing frequency of ""suicidal thoughts"" (which the writer is actively trying to conceal, suggesting their significance) fit the definition of ""active suicidal desire.""
        *   There is no specific plan or immediate timeline.
        *   This aligns well with the **Ideation** category.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
        *   While there is distress and a metaphor (""grave""), the key is the explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" and their increasing frequency. This is more than *only* distress or rejected thoughts.
        *   The ""Rejection downgrade"" rule (""I don't actually want to"" → indicator) does *not* apply here, as the writer is not rejecting the thoughts themselves but rather the *discussion* of them. The thoughts are present and increasing.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post explicitly states the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" and notes that they are occurring ""more and more frequently."" This indicates active and worsening suicidal ideation. There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or immediate intent, nor is there a past attempt. The reluctance to discuss these thoughts is a coping mechanism for the stress of therapy, not a rejection of the thoughts themselves. Therefore, it fits the definition of Ideation.

    *   **Specific methods:** ""shooting up the school"" - This is mentioned in the context of what the ex-friend ""bullied me into nearly killing myself/shooting up the school"". This is not presented as the writer's *current* suicidal method or intent, but rather a past consideration or consequence of bullying, possibly related to violence rather than self-harm. The ""nearly killing myself"" is the key self-harm reference.
    *   **Preparations:** None for current intent.
    *   **Past actions:** ""nearly killing myself"" - This is a strong indicator of a past action with suicidal intent.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I fucking hate living"" is an active expression of profound negative feelings about life. ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"" indicates current despair.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of current suicidal thoughts (though current thoughts are not explicitly ""I want to die"").

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?**
        *   The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" is present.
        *   According to the **Attempt** definition: ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts"" and ""*Clarification*: 'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt"".
        *   ""Nearly killing myself"" fits the description of an aborted attempt or coming very close to an attempt, implying concrete action or near-action with suicidal intent in the past. This is a direct match for the 'Attempt' category's clarification.
    *   Given that a past attempt is described, the ""Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation"" rule means this category takes precedence over any concurrent ideation or behavior (though current statements are more distress/ideation-adjacent than explicit behavior).

**Conclusion:** The most significant and definitive element in the post is the description of a past event where the writer ""nearly killing myself."" This directly aligns with the definition of an 'Attempt' which includes interrupted or aborted attempts.

    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""Suicide has become my quick solution."" This is a clear statement of active endorsement and acceptance of suicide as a desired outcome or solution. ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all"" also indicates active desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** No, these are not presented as intrusive or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No disavowal or rejection of the suicidal thoughts.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" implies a current state of mind where suicide is viewed as a viable solution.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future plan, but the current acceptance of suicide as a solution points towards ideation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""Suicide has become my quick solution."").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (""tonight"", ""right now"").
        *   Therefore, not **BEHAVIOR**.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" clearly expresses a desire for suicide as a solution. ""want to find a way to get away from it all"" also indicates this desire.
        *   Non-actionable methods: ""find a way to get away from it all"" is non-specific.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Confirmed.
        *   This fits the definition of **IDEATION**.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, because there is clear, active suicide intent.

**Category Definitions with Key Clarifications Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. There is an ""explicit wish to die"" (framed as a ""quick solution"") and a non-actionable desire (""find a way to get away from it all"") without any specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of past action.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.

3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection present.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

The post clearly states ""Suicide has become my quick solution,"" which is an active endorsement of suicide as a desired outcome, but it lacks any details of a plan, means, or immediate intent. This falls squarely into the 'Ideation' category.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

    *   **Passive experience:** The post describes the *experience* of depression and its difficulty (""It makes it hard to keep going,"" ""Feels like only depressed people can understand"").

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit suicide desire (e.g., ""I want to die""). The phrase ""hard to keep going"" expresses difficulty in living, not a desire to die.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post expresses general unhappiness, hopelessness, and despair related to depression, without any active suicidal desire, plans, or methods.

I'm 18 and my dad died when I was around 2 but I was never really told what happened or ever even seen his grave, finding out he committed suicide just makes it seem like it's inevitable for me and I can'tstop thinking about it. ive felt like shit for years now I feel like I'm reliving the same day everyday, I've even begun skipping classes it just takes so much energy, I get suicidal thoughts but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it. I keep saying to myself I'll see a doctor but deep down I know that's not true.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicide"" (referring to dad's death), ""suicidal thoughts"" (referring to self), ""to ever do it"" (referring to suicide for self).
*   **Indirect death references:** ""it's inevitable for me"" (in context of dad's suicide, implies own death by suicide).
*   **Emotional markers:** ""felt like shit for years"", ""reliving the same day everyday"", ""takes so much energy"", ""can't stop thinking about it"", ""deep down I know that's not true"" (regarding seeing a doctor). These indicate hopelessness, chronic despair, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
*   **Specific methods:** None mentioned for self.
*   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **Past actions:** Describes *dad's* suicide, not own.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** ""I get suicidal thoughts"" indicates the presence of these thoughts.
*   **Passive experience:** ""can't stop thinking about it"" suggests intrusive nature.
*   **Rejection noted?** ""but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it."" This is a clear disavowal of *acting* on the suicidal thoughts, stating a perceived inability or lack of courage to follow through. This is a crucial point for classification.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""Found out a few weeks ago my dad's cause of death and it was suicide."" ""ive felt like shit for years now"".
*   **Present intent:** ""I get suicidal thoughts.""
*   **Future ideation:** ""it's inevitable for me"" (a feeling about the future, not a plan). ""I'll see a doctor but deep down I know that's not true"" (a rejected future action).

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. (Refers to dad's suicide, not own).
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. While ""I get suicidal thoughts"" suggests intent, the immediate follow-up ""but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" negates the *actionable* intent.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** ""I get suicidal thoughts"" would initially fit here. However, the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule is directly applicable.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
    *   Distress: Yes (""felt like shit for years"", ""reliving the same day everyday"").
    *   Metaphors: ""inevitable for me"" could be seen as metaphorical inevitability rather than a concrete plan.
    *   Rejected/intrusive thoughts: ""I get suicidal thoughts but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it."" This perfectly matches the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" definition, as the writer explicitly states they won't act on the thoughts.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, focused on the writer's own thoughts and feelings.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt/behavior.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** **CRITICAL**. The phrase ""but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" functions as a clear disavowal of action despite the presence of suicidal thoughts. This directly triggers the ""Rejection downgrade: ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator"" rule.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will ensure this.

**Conclusion:** While the post mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" the explicit rejection of acting on them (""but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"") is the dominant factor. This falls under the definition of ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" within the **Indicator** category, as per the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule. The post expresses significant distress and passive ideation, but not active, actionable suicidal desire.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** The post states ""but i'm scared. i'm scared that if i do it i'll miss out on something."" and ""i just wanna hang onto that string of hope of that it will get better."" This indicates ambivalence and fear of dying, and a small desire for things to improve, but it is *not* an explicit disavowal like ""I don't actually want to kill myself."" The desire to ""off myself"" is still actively present, albeit conflicted. The ""Rejection downgrade"" rule applies only if the desire is explicitly rejected (""I don't actually want to""). Ambivalence does not qualify as a rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No past suicide attempts or plans.

**Category Definitions Check:**

    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, explicitly stated (""I want to give up my life and just die"", ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"").
    *   **Passive experience:** ""suicidal thoughts are like eating me up"" indicates intrusive thoughts, but this is *in addition* to active endorsement.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The user states ""but i can't leave my parents too"". This is a *reason not to act* due to external factors (impact on parents), not an explicit disavowal or rejection of the underlying suicidal desire itself. The desire to die is still very strong and present. According to Irreducible Rule 4, a downgrade to Indicator only happens if there's an explicit disavowal like ""I don't actually want to"". This is not present here.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
*   **Writer-focused:** Yes, all analysis is on the user's own thoughts/feelings.
*   **Temporal hierarchy:** No attempt or behavior, so ideation is the highest applicable.
*   **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy (""tonight"", ""now"") present.
*   **Rejection downgrade:** The statement ""but i can't leave my parents too"" is a protective factor/conflict, not a rejection of the *desire* to die. The explicit desire remains. Therefore, no downgrade to Indicator.

I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. (""I've fucking tried"" is about trying to move on, not an attempt.)
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""I need to die"").
        *   Specific method: No.
        *   Preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No (no ""tonight"", ""right now"", ""this weekend"").
        *   Therefore, does not meet criteria for BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → Yes. The post clearly states an explicit wish to die (""I need to die"") and endorses the act (""kill yourself? It's perfectly reasonable"") without specifying a method, preparation, or an immediate timeline. This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is clear active suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'I need to die'"". ""No preparation or immediate timeline.""
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of a past attempt.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as only one category is strongly indicated.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of suicidal thoughts.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'ideation'.

The post expresses a clear, active desire to die and endorsement of suicide, but without any concrete plan, method, or immediate timeline. This aligns directly with the definition of Ideation.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references (from parents, directed at writer):** ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""Just shoot yourself already,"" ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"".
    *   **Indirect death references (from parents, directed at writer):** ""If you disappeared.""
    *   **Emotional markers:** The post conveys extreme emotional abuse, invalidation, and rejection from the parents, which would undoubtedly lead to feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and unbearable pain for the writer, even if the writer doesn't explicitly state these emotions themselves. The parents' comments directly mock the writer's depression and past self-harm.
    *   **Specific methods (from parents, directed at writer):** ""gun,"" ""shoot yourself,"" ""cut your wrists.""
    *   **Preparations:** None stated by the writer.
    *   **Past actions (implied/referenced by parents, concerning the writer):** ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"". These are questions from the parents that strongly imply the writer has engaged in these actions previously.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The *writer* does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I am going to kill myself."" The post is a collection of quotes from the parents.
    *   **Passive experience:** The writer is presenting these quotes as their experience, which includes the parents' acknowledgment of the writer's past suicidal actions.
    *   **Rejection noted?** The writer does not reject suicidal thoughts or past actions. The writer's only direct quote expresses pain and questioning of their existence (""why did you want to have a daughter in the first place"").

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** The repeated questions from the parents (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"") are direct references to *past actions* by the writer.
    *   **Present intent:** No present intent stated by the writer.
    *   **Future ideation:** No future ideation stated by the writer.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** Yes. The parents' quotes (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"") directly refer to past suicide attempts or self-harm with suicidal intent by the writer. The framework's clarification for 'Attempt' states: ""*Clarification*: 'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt."" While these are questions from the parents, the writer is sharing these as part of their reality, indicating these past actions occurred. This strongly points to an 'Attempt' classification.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** The references to suicide attempts and self-harm are directed *at the writer* by the parents, and the writer is sharing these as part of their experience. This is not about others' actions, but the writer's past actions as acknowledged by others.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Attempt > Behavior > Ideation. Since past attempts are clearly referenced, this category takes precedence.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as there is no immediate intent from the writer.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable as the writer does not reject suicidal thoughts or past actions.
5.  **Output exactly one:** The classification will be 'attempt'.

*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kill yourself"", ""Kim's"" (highly likely typo for ""kill myself"").
*   **Indirect death references:** None.
*   **Emotional markers:** Desperation, urgency (""I just need a way,"" ""someone just give me a straight up answer""), rejection of help/support (""don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit"").
*   **Specific methods:** Asking *for* a method (""What's the least painful way?""), but not stating one they possess or plan to use.
*   **Preparations:** None stated.
*   **Past actions:** None stated.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** Yes, the writer is actively seeking information to facilitate self-harm (""I just need a way""). The ""I know I shouldn't be asking this"" is an acknowledgment of social norms, not a rejection of the suicidal intent itself.
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted?:** No. The post explicitly rejects interventions or reasons to live, reinforcing the active suicidal desire.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** No.
*   **Present intent:** The phrasing ""I just need a way"" and ""someone just give me a straight up answer"" indicates a current, urgent need for information to act.
*   **Future ideation:** Not a vague future; the urgency points to a present need.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""kill yourself"", ""I just need a way to Kim's"").
    *   **Specific method/preparation:** The user is *asking* for a specific method (""least painful way""), but does not *state* that they have acquired means or have a chosen method.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** No explicit ""tonight"" or ""right now"" is present. The urgency is in seeking information, not in stating an immediate action.

    Comparing with definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is clear active suicidal desire.
    *   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'..."" and ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"". This post fits perfectly here. It expresses an explicit desire to die by suicide and is seeking a ""painless way"" without specifying a method they possess or an imminent timeline. The ""Key boundary"" states it becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with ""tonight"" or ""now,"" which is not the case here.
    *   **Behavior:** Requires a *stated* specific method (e.g., ""I have pills""), *preparation evidence*, or an *imminent timeline* (e.g., ""tonight""). While there's urgency, the post is still in the information-gathering stage, not the execution stage with a concrete plan or immediate commitment.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicidal note"" - direct reference to suicide.
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside"" - indicates severe distress, emotional pain.
    *   **Specific methods:** None for the act of suicide itself, but ""writing a suicidal note"" is a preparatory action.
    *   **Preparations:** ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note"" - this is an explicit statement of intent to engage in a preparation for suicide. The word ""again"" suggests a history of this preparation.
    *   **Past actions:** ""again"" implies a past instance of writing such a note, reinforcing the pattern of suicidal ideation/planning.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I think I'm going to write..."" - This is an active, self-owned statement of intent. It is not presented as intrusive or rejected.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Present intent:** ""I think I'm going to write..."" indicates a current decision/plan to initiate a preparatory action.
    *   **Past focus:** ""again"" refers to a past instance of this preparation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No, writing a note is a preparation, not an attempt (self-harm with suicidal intent).
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""suicidal note"" clearly links to suicide.
        *   **Preparation:** Yes, ""write a suicidal note"" is explicitly listed as ""Preparation evidence: ... wrote note"" under the **Behavior** category definition.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** While there's no ""tonight"" for the suicide itself, there's immediate intent to *start* the preparation (""I think I'm going to write""). The framework prioritizes ""preparation evidence"" for **Behavior**.

    *   **Comparing with Ideation:** Ideation is defined as ""No preparation or immediate timeline."" This post *does* contain preparation evidence.
    *   **Comparing with Behavior:** Behavior includes ""Preparation evidence: ... wrote note"". This matches the post perfectly. The ""I think I'm going to"" indicates active intent to carry out this preparation.

    Therefore, the presence of active intent to engage in a preparatory action (writing a suicidal note) classifies this as **Behavior**.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, ""I think I'm going to write...""
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No attempt. Behavior (preparation) is present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** The immediate intent to *prepare* is present, which qualifies for Behavior.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of the thoughts/intent.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""slaying myself"" - This is a direct, albeit somewhat metaphorical, reference to suicide.
    *   Indirect death references: None beyond the direct one.
    *   Emotional markers: Not explicitly stated, but the context of ""massacre or maybe just slaying myself"" suggests extreme distress or violent ideation.
    *   Specific methods: None for ""slaying myself"".
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I will end up... slaying myself"" - This is an active statement of potential future intent. The ""or maybe just"" indicates a consideration or internal debate, but the ""slaying myself"" part is presented as a possible personal action.
    *   Passive experience: Not passive.
    *   Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal. The ""or maybe just"" presents it as an alternative outcome, not a rejected thought.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: No, ""will end up"" is future-oriented.
    *   Future ideation: Yes, ""I will end up... slaying myself"" indicates a future, non-specific timing.

    *   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'..."" - ""slaying myself"" fits this. ""Non-actionable methods..."" - ""slaying myself"" is non-specific. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" - This is true. This category fits well.
    *   **Behavior:** No specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
    *   **Attempt:** No past action described.

I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics.

I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

    *   **Passive experience:** Not explicitly framed as intrusive, but rather as stemming from shame.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** **YES.** The post explicitly states: ""As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" This is a clear and direct rejection of the desire to die.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No, because the explicit intent is to *live*, not to die.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No, because the explicit desire to die is *rejected* (""I don't want to die— I want to live""). While ""suicidal ideation"" is mentioned, the *active desire* to die is disavowed.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This fits. The post expresses significant distress and explicitly rejects the desire to die, even while acknowledging the *existence* of ""suicidal ideation"" (which is then framed as stemming from shame, not current desire). The ""Rejection downgrade"" rule is critical here.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt/behavior).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator. This rule directly applies due to the statement ""I don't want to die— I want to live."" This overrides the mention of ""suicidal ideation"" in terms of current risk classification.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will ensure this.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses significant distress and acknowledges having ""suicidal ideation,"" but crucially and explicitly states ""I don't want to die— I want to live."" This clear rejection of suicidal desire, despite the presence of distress and past/ongoing ideation, places it in the ""Indicator"" category according to the framework's ""Rejection downgrade"" rule and the definition of ""Indicator"" (specifically ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" and ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"").

    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head."" (Initial thought is an active desire).
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? **YES.** ""But at the same time I'm hesitant because what if I don't die, but instead get permanently disabled... so I'm not risking it."" This is an explicit disavowal/rejection of the *action* due to a specific negative consequence (disability).

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: The initial ""I wanna"" suggests present ideation, but the subsequent ""so I'm not risking it"" negates present *intent to act*.
    *   Future ideation: No specific future timing.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

        *   Preparation: No active preparation described.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   **CRITICAL ANALYSIS**: While there is explicit suicide intent and a specific method, the statement ""so I'm not risking it"" is a clear rejection of the *action*. This directly invokes **IRREDUCIBLE RULE 4: Rejection downgrade: ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator.** The phrase ""I'm not risking it"" functions as a reason *not* to act, similar to ""I don't want to"" (due to fear of disability).

    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → INDICATOR
        The presence of a rejected thought (""so I'm not risking it"" due to fear of disability) despite the specific ideation, aligns this with the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" clarification for **Indicator**. The person is expressing a thought process involving suicide, but explicitly stating they will *not* act on it due to a specific fear, thereby rejecting the action.

    *   **Final check against definitions:**
        *   **Indicator**: ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts (""brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to"")"" - The user's statement ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head. But... so I'm not risking it"" fits this, as the *action* is explicitly rejected due to a perceived negative outcome.
        *   **Ideation**: ""Explicit wish to die... No preparation or immediate timeline"". While there's an explicit wish and specific method, the *rejection of the action* is the dominant factor here, pushing it out of Ideation and into Indicator per Rule 4.
        *   **Behavior**: Requires intent + capability (specific method/preparation/imminent timeline). The intent to *act* is explicitly negated by ""I'm not risking it.""

The explicit rejection of the action (""so I'm not risking it"") due to a specific fear of a negative outcome (disability) is the determining factor, as per Irreducible Rule 4, which downgrades the classification.

    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal. While the person states ""I just try to get through the day in hope my breathing will get back to normal,"" this is a hope for improvement, not a rejection of the suicidal thoughts themselves. The conditional ""If my breathing doesn't go back to normal I can't see myself having a life worthliving"" reinforces the conditional nature of their will to live.

    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No specific method, no preparation, no immediate timeline. While there's a strong implicit desire for life to end, it's not framed as explicit ""suicide intent"" with a plan or immediacy.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → This fits best. ""My life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worthliving"" are strong expressions of a desire for life to cease or a lack of desire to continue living due to perceived worthlessness. This aligns with ""explicit wish to die"" or ""don't deserve to live"" from the Ideation definition, even if not using those exact phrases. There is no actionable plan or immediate timeline.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This is more than *only* distress or metaphors. The statements about life's worth are active judgments, not rejected thoughts.

**Conclusion based on definitions:**
*   **Indicator** is for general distress, metaphors, or rejected thoughts. This post goes beyond general distress to a statement about the *worth* of life itself. It's not a rejected thought.
*   **Ideation** includes ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"". ""My life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worthliving"" are direct expressions of life having no value, which is a strong form of suicidal ideation, implying a desire for life to end. There's no plan or immediacy, which keeps it from being Behavior.

Therefore, the post expresses active suicidal desire (life not worth living) without a specific plan or immediate intent.

    *   Past actions: None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon."" ""I think I'll be gone."" This is a clear statement of active intent.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? No. The statement ""I don't want to do it on Christmas"" is about *timing*, not a rejection of the suicidal act itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: No immediate present intent.
    *   Future ideation: ""soon"", ""by February"". This is a future, non-immediate timeframe.

        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""I think I'm going to kill myself soon"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no specific method or immediate timeline. The timeline ""by February"" is not immediate.
        *   This aligns with **Ideation**.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? No, there is explicit suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator**: Ruled out by explicit suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation**: Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die"" (""kill myself soon""), ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" (""by February"" is not immediate).
*   **Behavior**: Ruled out by lack of specific method/preparation and lack of *imminent* timeline. ""By February"" is not ""tonight"" or ""right now"".
*   **Attempt**: Ruled out by no description of past action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, no immediate behavior. Ideation is the highest applicable category.
3.  Immediacy trumps: The timeline is ""by February"", which is not immediate, so it does not trump ideation to become behavior.

    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""I just want to die"", ""gonna end my life"". The writer takes ownership of these thoughts and states an intention.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: No ""right now"" or ""tonight"".

While not ""tonight"" or ""right now,"" the ""Behavior"" definition includes ""this weekend"" as an imminent timeline. ""This month"" is a similar, relatively short and defined timeframe, indicating a concrete plan rather than just a wish. This moves it beyond simple ideation.
        *   Therefore, this condition is met.

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → Not applicable, as immediacy/imminence was identified.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Not applicable.

Based on the framework, particularly the ""Imminent timeline"" aspect of the Behavior category which includes ""this weekend"" and can be extended to ""this month"" for a defined, concrete plan, the post falls into Behavior.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, all about ""I"".

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""suicidal thoughts"" (mentioned as something the writer has/had, influencing their worldview).
    *   Indirect death references: ""world is falling apart and soon will turn into hell"" (referring to the world, not the writer's personal death).
    *   Emotional markers: ""pessimistic"", ""suffering"", ""mental illnesses"", ""got hate for being realistic and honest"". These indicate distress and a negative outlook.
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: No past *attempts*. The phrase ""suicidal thoughts helped me to understood the world"" refers to past *thoughts* or a characteristic state, not a past action.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The writer acknowledges ""suicidal thoughts"" as something they possess or have possessed (""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughts helped me""). However, this is descriptive of a mental state or a past influence, *not* an active, present desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). The statement ""If you are mental ill or suicidal and still want kids go for it"" also treats ""suicidal"" as a characteristic of a person, not an active, immediate intent.
    *   Passive experience: The thoughts are presented as part of their identity or past experience, rather than an intrusive, unwanted current desire.
    *   Rejection noted? No explicit rejection (""but I won't do it""), but also no active endorsement of a present desire to die. The context is philosophical reflection on the world, not personal suicidal intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""suicidal thoughts *helped* me to understood the world"" (past tense for the *effect* of the thoughts).
    *   Present intent: No clear present intent to die. The post is a general commentary.
    *   Future ideation: No.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No. (The mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" is about thoughts/state, not actions).
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? No. There is no explicit *present* intent to die, no method, no preparation, and no immediate timeline.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? No. The post does *not* contain an explicit wish to die (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I was dead""). It mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" as a characteristic or influence, not an active, present desire for death.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? Yes. The post clearly expresses distress (""suffering,"" ""mental illnesses,"" ""pessimistic""). It mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but in a descriptive way, as part of their mental state or past experience, rather than an active, present desire to die. This fits the ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" clarification for Indicator. The presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" as a characteristic, without an active desire to die, aligns with the Indicator category.

**Final Check against Definitions and Rules:**
*   **Indicator:** ""Distress without actionable suicide intent."" ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair."" ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire."" This matches well. The post is distressed and mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but does not express an active desire to die.
*   **Ideation:** Requires ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"". This is absent.
*   The post is primarily a philosophical commentary on the world, framed by the writer's mental state, which includes ""suicidal thoughts"" as a characteristic, not an active, current intent.

Therefore, the most appropriate category is Indicator.

    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** ""blades i used to cut"" implies past self-harm/cutting, but not explicitly a past *suicide attempt* (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself with blades""). It describes past *behavior* (cutting) rather than a past *attempt* with suicidal intent. The phrasing ""won't go that deep"" also suggests it was not effective for a lethal purpose.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""cannot live if i fail"" (conditional intent).
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** YES, very strongly. ""for the first time i don't wanna die"", ""I'm almost happy"", ""I'm almost enjoying doing stuff"", ""I'm in a decent place right now and i want to keep doing things"", ""I'm feeling better nonetheless"". This is a clear and strong rejection of current suicidal intent, despite the conditional future ideation.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""blades i used to cut"" (past self-harm, not a past *attempt* as defined).
    *   **Present intent:** Strong rejection of dying (""I don't wanna die""), desire to live/continue activities (""want to keep doing things"", ""feeling better""). There's a present *ambivalence* (""not like i wanna live either"") but the dominant present feeling is one of improvement and rejection of suicide.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""final test that will decide whether or not I'll live till October"" (conditional future ideation). ""I don't know how I'll do it"" (in the context of the previous statements, this seems to refer to the *lack* of means/plan if the conditional ideation were to become active, rather than a current plan).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No. ""blades i used to cut"" describes past self-harm/cutting, not a past *suicide attempt* as per the definition requiring ""actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" or ""tried to/attempted"".
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No. While there's conditional intent (""cannot live if i fail""), there's no specific method (in fact, a *lack* of means is highlighted) and no preparation or immediate timeline. The overall present intent is *against* suicide.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** While ""cannot live if i fail"" is a form of explicit desire, it's conditional and heavily counteracted by the strong present rejection and desire to live. This category is typically for active, present desire without a plan. The strong rejection makes it not fit here.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** This fits best. The post contains significant distress (""cannot live if i fail""), but crucially, it also contains strong explicit rejection of suicidal desire (""for the first time i don't wanna die"", ""I'm almost happy"", ""I want to keep doing things"", ""feeling better""). The ""Irreducible Rule 4: Rejection downgrade: 'I don't actually want to' → indicator"" applies directly here. The overall message is one of struggling with suicidal thoughts but actively rejecting them and finding reasons to live.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** No clear attempt or immediate behavior to overrule.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** *Crucial here*. The post contains very strong statements of rejection of suicidal intent and a desire to live/continue. This pushes it to 'Indicator'.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'indicator'.

The presence of ""I don't wanna die"" and the overall positive shift in mood, despite the conditional ""cannot live if i fail,"" aligns with the 'Indicator' category's ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" and ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" (in the present moment). The lack of means also reinforces the current state of non-actionability.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** None.
*   **Indirect death references:** None. The phrase ""don't know what to do anymore with my life"" expresses a feeling of being lost and overwhelmed, not a desire for death. ""exhausted and thrown out"" is metaphorical for being used up by a system, not literal death.
*   **Emotional markers:** ""drained me the fuck out of all my motivation"", ""useless"", ""taken my will to strive"", ""overwhelming comparison"", ""stuck in a system"", ""forced to be milked out of work labor until we're exhausted"", ""neverending process only helps the things I hate the most"", ""don't know what to do anymore with my life"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, exhaustion, and a feeling of being trapped and directionless.
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** None.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** The post describes feelings of despair, hopelessness, and being overwhelmed by life circumstances and a perceived oppressive system. It expresses a lack of motivation and direction (""taken my will to strive"", ""don't know what to do anymore with my life""). However, there is no active endorsement of suicidal thoughts or desire to die.
*   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
*   **Rejection noted?:** No suicidal thoughts are expressed to be rejected.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** Describes past and ongoing experiences (""all I've done through school"", ""all the work I've put into it"").
*   **Present intent:** Describes current feelings of being drained, stuck, and not knowing what to do.
*   **Future ideation:** None related to suicide.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No explicit suicide intent.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I was dead""). The phrase ""don't know what to do anymore with my life"" is a general expression of despair and feeling lost, not an active suicidal desire.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post is overwhelmingly characterized by general unhappiness, hopelessness, and despair. There are no expressions of active suicidal desire, no methods, no plans, and no past attempts. The distress is clear and pervasive.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" - This aligns perfectly. ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" - This also aligns.
*   **Ideation:** Requires ""Explicit wish to die"". Not present.
*   **Behavior:** Requires ""Specific method"", ""Preparation"", or ""Imminent timeline"". Not present.
*   **Attempt:** Requires ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"". Not present.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no higher categories are present.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Yes, 'indicator'.

The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed and directionless, but it does not contain any explicit suicidal ideation, plans, or past attempts. Therefore, it falls into the 'indicator' category.

Im sorry everyone. Im not strong enough.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kill myself"", ""die"", ""I'm just waiting for the end"", ""ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""net gain for the world if i die"", ""my body probably wouldn't be found for months"", ""it'll never be know that I died"".
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""failed"", ""failure"", ""toxic family"", ""depression"", ""fear"", ""regret"", ""worthlessness"", ""dumbass"", ""lazy asshole"", ""hate myself"", ""sad"", ""afraid"", ""not strong enough"". High levels of despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"", ""start cutting myself to try and ease my pain"" (the last one, while potentially self-harm, is listed alongside explicit suicide methods, suggesting it's also considered a means to an end by the writer).
    *   **Preparations:** ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do."" This indicates a conditional readiness, but the ""or hell even if I don't"" removes the conditionality, implying the intent is present regardless of location. No active preparation (e.g., acquiring means) is mentioned *as currently happening*.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do. Either kill myself..."", ""Its a net gain for the world if i die."", ""I'm just waiting for the end."" The writer clearly owns these thoughts and desires.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** ""I want help so badly. But im afraid. Really afraid. Im sorry everyone. Im not strong enough."" This expresses a desire for help and fear, but it does *not* explicitly disavow the suicidal intent. It's a cry for help and an expression of current emotional state, but the underlying suicidal desire and readiness remain. The ""not strong enough"" refers to living, not to acting on suicidal thoughts.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm just waiting for the end."" ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold."" These phrases convey a strong sense of current readiness and immediate desire for the end, even if a precise ""tonight"" or ""now"" isn't used. The ""ready to slip into unconsciousness"" implies an immediate state of being prepared.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do."" This initially seems future-oriented, but the ""or hell even if I don't"" and the subsequent ""I'm just waiting for the end. I'm ready to slip..."" push it towards a more immediate, less conditional timeframe.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""kill myself"", ""want to die"", ""waiting for the end"").
        *   **Specific method:** Yes (""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"").
        *   **Preparation:** No active preparation mentioned.
        *   **Imminent timeline:** While ""tonight"" isn't explicitly stated, the phrases ""I'm just waiting for the end"" and ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold"" strongly convey a state of readiness and a desire for the action to occur soon, implying a very near-term or current intent. This goes beyond mere ideation. The ""Behavior"" definition includes ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" The current post has *both* specific methods *and* a strong sense of readiness/immediacy.

    *   Comparing with ""Ideation"": Ideation involves explicit desire but ""No preparation or immediate timeline."" This post has specific methods and a strong sense of readiness/imminence, pushing it beyond Ideation.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
        2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt.
        3.  Immediacy trumps: The ""I'm ready"" and ""waiting for the end"" combined with specific methods indicate a strong level of current intent and readiness, overriding a less specific ideation.
        4.  Rejection downgrade: The desire for help is not a rejection of suicidal intent.

    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of explicit suicidal intent, specific methods, and a strong sense of current readiness/waiting for the end (""I'm just waiting for the end. I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness..."") aligns most closely with the ""Behavior"" category. The specific methods elevate it from Ideation, and the strong sense of readiness implies a very near-term capability and intent.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice.

This is a rejection of the *action* based on a complex moral/punishment belief, *not* a rejection of the *desire* to die or the *validity* of the plans. The desire and plans remain active.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** Describes long-standing suicidal thoughts (""for years now""), past attempts at coping, and a past loss (mom died early this year).
*   **Present intent:** ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""
*   **Future ideation:** Not explicitly future-focused beyond the immediate contemplation. No imminent timeline for *execution* is stated; rather, the action is currently being withheld.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
    *   No. The post describes detailed planning and contemplation, not a past concrete action of self-harm with suicidal intent.

    *   *Decision:* Despite the lack of an immediate timeline, the presence of explicit suicide intent *and* specific method/preparation meets the criteria for **Behavior**. The ""OR"" in the rule means only one of the two conditions (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) is needed in addition to explicit intent. The ""rejection downgrade"" rule (IRREDUCIBLE RULE 4) applies when the *desire itself* is rejected (""I don't actually want to""), which is not the case here. The user *does* want to die and has active plans, but is currently constrained by a specific reason for not acting.

    *   **Preparations:** The discussion about calling grandparents, telling friends ""I love them"", and hugging a little brother, specifically questioning if these actions would ""haunt people more or something"" *after* the event, strongly suggests contemplating final goodbyes as a preparation for an imminent act. The phrase ""the day i chose is very soon"" also implies a chosen, imminent date.

    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** No. The writer explicitly rejects *intervention* (""not interested in being talked down at all,"" ""not at all interested in anti suicide discourse""), but *not* the suicidal intent itself.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"" (historical ideation).
    *   **Present intent:** ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates an imminent, concrete timeline. The contemplation of ""final goodbyes"" (calling grandparents, telling friends love them, hugging brother) is a present consideration directly tied to this imminent timeline.
    *   **Future ideation:** This goes beyond non-specific future ideation due to the ""very soon"" timeline and contemplation of final actions.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. ""wanted to do this for over a decade"" is ideation, not an attempt.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → Yes.
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Present and strong (""the day i chose is very soon"", ""not cut out for life"", ""not interested in being talked down"").
        *   **Preparation:** Contemplating final goodbyes (calling grandparents, telling friends love, hugging brother) and the impact *after* the act.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""the day i chose is very soon"" clearly indicates immediacy.
    *   This leads to **BEHAVIOR**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** No, there is clear active suicidal desire, an imminent timeline, and signs of preparation.
*   **Ideation:** No, because the post includes an ""immediate timeline"" (""very soon"") and clear signs of ""preparation"" (contemplating final goodbyes). The ""Key boundary"" for Ideation states it ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"". ""Very soon"" functions as an immediate timeline.
*   **Behavior:** This fits perfectly. It includes ""Imminent timeline: 'very soon'"" and ""Preparation evidence: contemplating final goodbyes/calls."" The ""Critical expansion"" notes that ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details,"" and ""the day i chose is very soon"" is such an expression.
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt is described.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
3.  Immediacy trumps: ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates immediacy, overriding general ideation.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The writer rejects *being talked down*, not the suicidal intent itself. So, no downgrade to Indicator.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output 'behavior'.

The combination of a chosen, imminent date (""very soon"") and the contemplation of final goodbyes (calling loved ones, telling friends love, hugging brother, and wondering if it would ""haunt people more"") strongly points to concrete preparation for an imminent act, classifying it as Behavior.

        *   Immediate timeline: No (""tonight"", ""right now"").
        *   Therefore, this path is not fully met for 'Behavior'.

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → This is a strong fit.
        *   Explicit wish to die: ""want to be out of my misery"" (explicit wish for death as an escape), ""most suicidal I've been"" (explicit statement of current suicidal ideation).
        *   Non-actionable methods: No specific method mentioned.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: No specific preparation for suicide, no immediate timeline.

    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, because there is explicit suicidal ideation (""most suicidal I've been"") and an active desire for death (""want to be out of my misery""), not just general distress or rejected thoughts.

**Conclusion:** The post clearly expresses active suicidal desire and current suicidal ideation (""most suicidal I've been,"" ""want to be out of my misery"") without specifying a concrete plan, method, or immediate timeline. The isolation statement is not specific enough to qualify as ""preparation evidence"" for suicide under the framework's examples.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP"". This is a death wish directed *outward* towards another person, not a self-referential statement about the writer's own death or suicidal intent.
    *   Indirect death references: None related to the writer's own life or intent.
    *   Emotional markers: Anger, resentment, wishing harm upon another. Not hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain *regarding the writer's self*.
    *   Specific methods: None related to the writer's self.
    *   Preparations: None related to the writer's self.
    *   Past actions: None related to the writer's self.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The writer is expressing a desire for *someone else* to die, not themselves.
    *   Passive experience: Not applicable to self.
    *   Rejection noted? Not applicable to self.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Not applicable as the content is not about the writer's suicidal thoughts/actions.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No. (Rule 1: Writer-focused. This refers to the writer's own attempts, not a wish for others).
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? No. The intent is for *another person* to die, not the writer.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? No. The desire is for *another person* to die, not the writer.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? This post expresses intense anger and a death wish directed *outward*. While it shows distress, it's not the internal despair or hopelessness related to *self-harm* that the 'Indicator' category is designed for. The ""Writer-focused"" rule is paramount here. The post contains *no information* about the writer's own suicide risk.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
*   **1. Writer-focused:** This rule is critical. The post is explicitly about ""I hope *you* die"". This means the content is *not* focused on the writer's own suicidal intent or risk. Therefore, strictly adhering to this rule, the post does not provide information for classifying the *writer's* suicide risk within the provided categories.
*   Given that I *must* output one of the four categories, and the post contains *no evidence* of self-harm intent, the most appropriate classification is the lowest risk category. The post does express strong negative emotion (distress), and there is no *self-suicidal* intent. While the nature of the distress (outward anger vs. inward despair) doesn't perfectly align with the 'Indicator' definition, it is the only category that can be minimally stretched to fit a post that expresses distress but no self-harm intent, especially when forced to choose. It acknowledges the negative sentiment without incorrectly escalating the risk.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: The post states, ""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others."" This is a general statement *about* a type of suicide (murder-suicide), not an expression of the writer's personal suicidal intent.
    *   Indirect death references: None related to self-harm.
    *   Emotional markers: ""I have a problem,"" ""this women is bullying me,"" ""most jealous person I have ever met in my life,"" ""finally live my life in peace."" These indicate distress and a desire for resolution.
    *   Specific methods (for self-harm): None.
    *   Preparations (for self-harm): None.
    *   Past actions (for self-harm): None.
    *   **Crucial Observation**: The overwhelming content is an explicit statement of intent to kill *another person*: ""I will kill her,"" ""I will kill her,"" ""Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?"" This is homicidal intent, not suicidal intent.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement (of *suicidal* thoughts): No. The active endorsement is of *homicidal* thoughts.
    *   Passive experience (of *suicidal* thoughts): No.
    *   Rejection noted (of *suicidal* thoughts): Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are expressed by the writer.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""I tried every possible thing to make her stop"" (referring to stopping the bullying).
    *   Present intent: ""I will kill her"" (homicidal).
    *   Future ideation: ""to finally live my life in peace"" (after the intended murder).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. There is explicit *homicidal* intent, but no *suicidal* intent.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. There is no explicit *suicide* desire expressed by the writer.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This is the only category that *could* potentially apply, given the strict requirement to choose one of the *suicide* risk categories. The post expresses ""distress"" (""I have a problem, this women is bullying me"") and ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire."" The mention of ""suicide"" is a general statement about a phenomenon, not a personal expression of suicidal intent. The primary risk is homicidal, which is outside the scope of the *suicide* risk framework, but if forced to classify within the given suicide categories, ""Indicator"" is the least incorrect as it acknowledges distress without attributing suicidal intent.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, the writer's intent is analyzed.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: N/A as no suicidal intent.
3.  Immediacy trumps: N/A as no suicidal intent.
4.  Rejection downgrade: N/A as no suicidal intent.
5.  Output exactly one: Must choose one.

**Final Decision Logic:**
The post expresses clear homicidal intent and significant distress. It does *not* express any suicidal intent, ideation, behavior, or past attempt by the writer. The framework is specifically for *suicide* risk classification. As there is no suicidal intent, the post does not fit neatly into any of the suicide risk categories. However, if forced to select from the given options, the ""Indicator"" category is defined as ""Distress without actionable suicide intent"" and includes ""General unhappiness... NO expressions of active suicidal desire."" This aligns with the post's distress and complete lack of suicidal intent. While the post's primary concern is homicidal, within the constraints of the *suicide* risk framework, ""Indicator"" is the most appropriate choice as it acknowledges distress without misclassifying the intent as suicidal.

I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""on the verge of suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""want to end it all""
*   **Indirect death references:** ""cannot do this anymore"" (implies wanting to cease existence)
*   **Emotional markers:** ""seriously cannot do this anymore"", ""mental health really bad"", ""stress"", ""disappointment and failure"" (hopelessness, worthlessness, unbearable pain)
*   **Specific methods:** Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""pills"", ""hanging"").
*   **Preparations:** Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""bought pills"").
*   **Past actions:** None described.
*   **Key phrase:** ""I know exactly what to do."" This is crucial as it implies a formed plan or method, even if not detailed to the reader.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer expresses active suicidal desire (""I'm on the verge of suicide"", ""I just want to end it all"") and claims ownership of a plan (""I know exactly what to do"").
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal. The phrase ""the stress might kill me before I even kill myself"" is a comparative statement, not a rejection of the self-harm intent.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** None.
*   **Present intent:** ""I'm on the verge of suicide"", ""I seriously cannot do this anymore"", ""I just want to end it all"", ""I know exactly what to do."" All indicate a current state of mind and a present, formed plan. While not ""tonight,"" ""on the verge"" and ""know exactly what to do"" suggest immediacy and readiness.
*   **Future ideation:** No.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
*   **Start here →**
*   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
*   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → BEHAVIOR**
    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""on the verge of suicide"", ""want to end it all"").
    *   **Specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline:**
        *   No explicit immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").
        *   No explicit preparation evidence (e.g., ""bought pills"").
        *   However, the phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" strongly implies that a *specific method* or *plan* is formed and known to the individual. This moves beyond general ideation (a wish to die) into the realm of having a concrete, actionable path in mind. The ""Behavior"" definition includes ""Specific method stated"" or ""Preparation evidence."" While not *stated to the audience*, the phrase indicates it is *known by the writer*, which aligns with the ""Capability"" aspect of Behavior. It's not just a thought; it's a plan.

*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → IDEATION**
    *   This post goes beyond mere desire because of ""I know exactly what to do,"" which implies a plan/method.

*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → INDICATOR**
    *   This post contains explicit suicide intent, not just distress or rejected thoughts.

**Conclusion:** The presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with the phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" indicates that the individual has a specific plan or method in mind, even if not detailed in the post. This signifies capability alongside intent, classifying it as **Behavior**.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all analysis is on the writer's statements.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable here as no attempt is mentioned.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While ""on the verge"" isn't ""tonight,"" ""I know exactly what to do"" signifies a formed plan, which is a strong indicator of capability and intent to act, moving it beyond mere ideation.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection present.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Yes.

        *   This points to IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? → No, there is explicit desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**

*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"" - Matches ""I just wanna die"". ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"" - ""Someone kill me"" fits this as it's not a self-directed, specific, or actionable plan. ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" - Confirmed. This fits perfectly.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific self-directed method, preparation, or imminent timeline. ""Someone kill me"" does not constitute a *self-directed* specific method.

    *   **Indirect death references:** ""tired of being unhappy lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed and always rejected,"" ""please take all thoughts away from my mind,"" ""take all gayness away all gender disphoria all depresion everything negetive out my life."" These express extreme emotional pain and a desire for current suffering to cease, but they do not explicitly or implicitly refer to death by suicide. The desire is for a transformation of self and circumstances, not for non-existence.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""tired of being,"" ""unhappy,"" ""lost and alone,"" ""depressed,"" ""rejected,"" ""sorry,"" ""please help me."" These clearly indicate hopelessness, despair, and unbearable pain.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer actively endorses a desire for relief from suffering and for a change in identity (""I want to be normal,"" ""please take all thoughts away from my mind,"" ""take all gayness away... everything negative out my life""). There is *no* active endorsement of suicidal thoughts or intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** No explicit disavowal of suicidal thoughts, but crucially, no *presence* of them to disavow. The focus is on wanting the *causes of suffering* to be removed.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Descriptions of past trauma and unhappiness.
    *   **Present intent:** The pleas are for immediate divine intervention to change the current state of being (""please god please make me straight,"" ""am tired,"" ""please help me""). There is no present intent related to ending life.
    *   **Future ideation:** No future ideation related to suicide.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No explicit suicide intent. The intent is to be ""normal"" and for suffering to end, not to die.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit suicide desire. The desire is for a different life, free from current pain and identity struggles.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post is overwhelmingly characterized by general unhappiness, hopelessness, and despair. There are no expressions of active suicidal desire. The desire to ""take all thoughts away from my mind"" refers to the distressing thoughts and feelings (gayness, gender dysphoria, depression), not suicidal ideation. This fits the definition of 'Indicator' perfectly.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:**
    *   General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair: **YES** (e.g., ""tired of being unhappy lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed and always rejected"").
    *   Metaphorical death references (""want to disappear""): While not direct death metaphors, the strong desire for ""everything negative"" to be taken away aligns with a desire for the current state of suffering to end, which is a core component of distress without suicidal intent.
    *   Rejected/intrusive thoughts: Not explicitly present in the context of suicide.
    *   NO expressions of active suicidal desire: **YES**. This is the critical differentiating factor. The post is a desperate plea for relief and transformation, not for death.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""suicidal"" - Yes, in the form of a question.

    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None related to suicide.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** No. The phrase ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" is a question directed outwards, asking if *others* feel this way. It is not an ""I am suicidal"" statement from the writer. It expresses extreme distress and explores the *idea* of suicide in relation to the pain, but does not claim ownership of active suicidal thoughts or intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not explicitly stated as intrusive.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal, but the question format itself implies a search for shared experience or validation of extreme pain, rather than a declaration of personal intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** The pain has been ongoing for 8 months.
    *   **Present intent:** The question is in the present tense.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""no change in sight"" indicates future hopelessness regarding the pain.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No. There is no explicit suicide intent from the writer, nor any method, preparation, or immediate timeline. The word ""suicidal"" is in a question about others.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No. The post does not contain an ""explicit wish to die"" from the writer. The question ""Anyone suicidal...?"" is a query about shared experience of extreme distress, not a personal declaration of suicidal desire.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post clearly conveys distress, hopelessness, and despair (""It hurts"", ""no change in sight""). The use of ""suicidal"" in a question form (""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"") serves to emphasize the extreme level of distress and pain, rather than expressing active suicidal desire from the writer. It fits the ""Distress without actionable suicide intent"" criteria.

1.  **Writer-focused:** The analysis focuses on the writer's intent. The writer is *asking* if *anyone* is suicidal, not stating ""I am suicidal."" This is crucial.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** N/A.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** N/A.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** While not explicitly rejected, the question format (""Anyone suicidal?"") implies a level of detachment from active personal intent, leaning it away from Ideation.

**Final Determination:** The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness related to chronic pain, and uses the term ""suicidal"" to convey the extremity of this distress, but it does so in the form of a question directed outwards (""Anyone suicidal...?""), not as a statement of the writer's own active suicidal desire or intent. This falls under ""Distress without actionable suicide intent.""

442,"Will somebody just love me. This year has absolutely destroyed me mentally. I don't think I can go on much longer. Everything feels like a road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose. My substance abuse is rooted in the need to be loved. Does anyone else feel this way? I'm married and I feel alone in my own head. I wish my partner would care about me the way I do about them. I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need. The damage that caused me has been irreparable. Fuck polyamory and open relationships too. I hate now this is normalized now. Not only do I feel distant from my friends, family and everything else around me but also my lover who's supposed to guide me through this pain and make me feel right. After covid, all the other shite that's happened this year too. I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over. I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death and not feel so guilty. Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again. The only person who truly understands the pain I'm feeling",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over."" ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"". ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again."" (The last part refers to others' actions but informs the writer's comfort with death).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""I don't think I can go on much longer."" ""Everything feels like a road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose.""
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""destroyed me mentally,"" ""pain,"" ""nothingness of no purpose,"" ""alone,"" ""abandoned,"" ""ruined me,"" ""irreparable damage,"" ""hate,"" ""distant,"" ""guilty."" (High levels of hopelessness, despair, and emotional pain).
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This is a self-imposed condition or task that must be completed before the stated end. It functions as a preparatory step or a trigger for the intended action.
    *   **Past actions:** None by the writer. (Rule 1: Ignore mentions of others' actions like ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life"").

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""I'm over life,"" ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death."" The writer clearly owns these thoughts and expresses a desire to end their life.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes past events contributing to current distress.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm over life.""
    *   **Future ideation/conditional intent:** ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This sets a specific, self-imposed condition for the end, implying a near-future action once the condition is met. It's not vague ""someday"" but ""after X, then Y.""

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""I'm over life,"" ""finally over,"" ""give in to the nothingness that is death"").
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** While no specific method is stated, ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" acts as a *preparation* or a *conditional trigger* for the suicidal act. It's a concrete, self-imposed task that precedes the stated end. This moves it beyond mere ideation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Not explicitly ""tonight"" or ""right now,"" but the ""one last record"" provides a defined, self-imposed timeline/trigger. This is more actionable and structured than general ideation.

    *   **Category Definitions Check:**
        *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to clear active suicidal desire.
        *   **Ideation:** While there's an explicit wish to die, the presence of a self-imposed ""preparation"" (""One last record..."") and a conditional timeline (""and its finally over"") elevates it beyond simple ideation. It's not just a wish; it's a plan with a pre-condition.
        *   **Behavior:** The post demonstrates explicit suicidal intent (""I'm over life,"" ""give in to the nothingness that is death""). The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" serves as a form of *preparation* or a *conditional imminent timeline*. It outlines a specific task to be completed before the intended action. This fits the ""Preparation evidence"" or ""Expressions of immediate intent"" (even if conditional) criteria for Behavior.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Application:**
        *   Rule 1 (Writer-focused): Adhered to.
        *   Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy): Not applicable (no attempt described).
        *   Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps): The conditional ""One last record... and its finally over"" implies a structured, self-defined path towards the end, which is more immediate/actionable than vague ideation.
        *   Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade): Not applicable (no rejection).

    *   **Conclusion:** The combination of explicit suicidal intent and a clearly articulated, self-imposed pre-condition/preparation (""One last record for me to make and its finally over"") elevates this from Ideation to Behavior. The individual is not just wishing to die but has a defined, albeit personal, trigger/task before the intended action.

445,"Melancholy. Work sleep work sleep work sleep. I just don't want to go on anymore. It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up. I deserve a chance to show everyone exactly how bad I've been hurting, and fuck you if you think I'm selfish. I just need a chance to help myself. I need to be able to feel at least some small happiness again. How do I go on?",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I just don't want to go on anymore."" (indirect, but in context of despair), ""I plan my suicide every single day."" (explicit), ""the solace of that escapism"" (referring to suicide planning).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""My life has already been over for six years now"" (metaphorical).
    *   **Emotional markers:** Melancholy, hopelessness (""don't want to go on""), worthlessness (""nothing ever works out""), anhedonia (""Why can't I feel anything anymore?"", ""Nothing interests me anymore""), despair (""bottomless pit"", ""no real meaning""), anger, grief, bitterness.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""using a pistol"", ""douse myself in gasoline and light up.""
    *   **Preparations:** ""I plan my suicide every single day."" (this is a strong indicator of ongoing preparation/planning), ""realistic and practical plans"", ""escape bag"" (potentially for a suicide plan).
    *   **Past actions:** No past suicide attempts described. ""Old injuries"" and ""nerve damage"" refer to physical ailments, not past attempts.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The writer states ""I plan my suicide every single day"" and describes these as ""realistic and practical plans."" There is clear ownership and endorsement of suicidal thoughts and plans.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal. The line ""Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going"" indicates that the *planning* is a coping mechanism, but it does not reject the underlying suicidal intent or the plans themselves. The final question ""How do I go on?"" is a cry of despair, not a rejection of suicide.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""My life has already been over for six years now"" (metaphorical), ""Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me"" (past events leading to current state). No past *suicide attempts*.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I just don't want to go on anymore."" (present desire), ""I plan my suicide every single day.""

(present articulation of specific plans).
    *   **Future ideation:** The daily planning implies an ongoing future consideration, but the methods are specific and described as ""realistic and practical,"" moving beyond vague future ideation.

        *   **Preparation:** ""I plan my suicide every single day."" (This is strong evidence of ongoing planning and preparation). ""realistic and practical plans"", ""escape bag"" also suggest preparation.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No explicit ""tonight"" or ""right now."" However, the combination of *daily planning* and *specific, realistic methods* is sufficient to classify it as Behavior, as per the definition: ""Behavior (Intent + Capability)"" which includes ""Specific method stated"" OR ""Preparation evidence."" Both are present. The ""Critical expansion"" for BEHAVIOR notes that expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details; conversely, detailed methods and preparation can qualify even without explicit immediacy.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No, because specific plans and methods are stated.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because there is clear active suicidal desire, planning, and specific methods.

    The presence of explicit daily planning (""I plan my suicide every single day"") combined with specific, ""realistic and practical"" methods (""pistol,"" ""gasoline and light up"") clearly indicates intent *and* capability/preparation, which aligns with the definition of **Behavior**. The lack of an immediate timeline (""tonight"") does not downgrade it to Ideation given the strong evidence of specific planning and methods.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** All content is about the writer's own experiences and intentions. (Pass)
2.  **Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation:** The presence of multiple past attempts, and a very recent aborted attempt, immediately places this in the 'Attempt' category, overriding any concurrent 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'. (Pass)
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** While there is immediacy (""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it""), the clear descriptions of *past attempts* (including the recent aborted one) take precedence due to the temporal hierarchy rule. (Pass)
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The ""chicken"" comment and ""can't pull myself together"" are described as *barriers to completion*, not a rejection of the *underlying suicidal desire*. The desire is still active. Therefore, no downgrade to Indicator. (Pass)

    *   Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of the thoughts and feelings: ""I feel like I'm at the point..."", ""I don't have any plans..."", ""I have stopped visiting..."", ""I just feel like it's not worth..."". There's a clear acceptance of death and a lack of desire to prolong life.

This is a crucial rejection of *active planning* or *immediate intent* for self-harm, but it is *not* a rejection of the underlying desire for death or the acceptance of it.

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, as identified above (""if I die then I die"", ""willing to accept when my time has come"", ""not worth pushing my life further""). This is a clear desire for death or a lack of will to live.
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Confirmed by ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it.""
        *   This strongly fits **IDEATION**. The passive action of stopping doctor visits supports this underlying ideation.

    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts →
        *   This is more than *only* distress or metaphors. There is a clear active acceptance of death and a lack of desire to prolong life, which goes beyond general unhappiness or merely rejected thoughts. The statement ""I don't have any plans to end it"" is a rejection of *active planning*, not a rejection of the *desire* for death itself.

**Category Definition Check:**
*   **Indicator:** ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"". This post *does* express a passive suicidal desire/acceptance of death.
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"". The post conveys a similar sentiment (""if I die then I die"", ""not worth pushing my life further"", ""willing to accept when my time has come""). ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" is also met. This is a strong match.
*   **Behavior:** Lacks specific method, active preparation for self-harm, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt mentioned.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or immediate behavior. Ideation is the highest applicable.
3.  Immediacy trumps: ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it"" explicitly removes the immediacy for active self-harm.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The rejection is of *active plans*, not of the *underlying desire* for death or acceptance of it. The core sentiment is one of passive suicidal ideation.

The post clearly expresses a desire for death or a lack of will to live, without specific active plans or immediate intent for self-harm. The passive action of stopping doctor visits supports this underlying ideation.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself""
    *   Indirect death references: None.
    *   Emotional markers: ""hate myself"", ""too much of a coward"", ""too depressed"", ""too ugly"", ""too lazy"", ""thyroid is too fucked up"" - indicate severe self-loathing, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific methods: ""starve myself or something"" - mentioned hypothetically as a possible extreme measure for weight loss, not as a suicide method.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The thought of ""kill myself"" is explicitly present and acknowledged by the writer (""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself""). This indicates the idea is actively considered or desired, even if the action is not.
    *   Passive experience: Not explicitly stated as intrusive.
    *   Rejection noted? ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" – This is a rejection of the *action* due to perceived personal inability (""cowardice""), not a rejection of the *desire* or *thought* of suicide itself. The desire or ideation is present, but the capability or courage to act is stated as lacking. This is distinct from ""I don't actually want to"" (which would downgrade to Indicator).

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: The statement ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" indicates a *lack* of present intent to act, despite the presence of the thought.
    *   Future ideation: No specific future plan or timeline.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: ""kill myself"" is present.
        *   Specific method/preparation: None for suicide. ""starve myself"" is hypothetical for weight loss, not a suicide plan.
        *   Immediate timeline: None.
        *   The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" explicitly negates the ""capability"" or ""immediacy"" required for the Behavior category.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die', 'don't deserve to live'"" - The phrase ""kill myself"" in the context of self-hatred and despair aligns with an explicit desire to end one's life.
        *   ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way' (without specification)"" - While a method isn't specified, the *lack of capability/courage to act* (as stated by the writer) means there's no actionable plan.
        *   ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" - This is true.

    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts →
        *   This post goes beyond ""ONLY distress/metaphors"". It explicitly mentions ""kill myself"".
        *   The ""rejected thoughts"" clarification (""brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to"") does not apply here, as the writer isn't saying they *don't want to* kill themselves, but rather that they lack the courage *to do it*. The desire/ideation is present.

    Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire or thought of suicide (""kill myself"") but explicitly states a lack of courage or capability to act on it, without any specific plan, preparation, or immediate timeline. This fits the definition of **Ideation**.

Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

It's a statement about the current *appropriateness* of suicide as an option, not an announcement of immediate action. The critical expansion for 'Behavior' requires ""expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight')"", which is not present.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → Yes.
        *   Explicit wish to die: ""I don't want to live"", ""I want out"", ""Death seems a better option to me"".

**Conclusion:** The post clearly expresses active suicidal desire and views suicide as an appropriate option given the circumstances. However, it lacks a specific method, preparation, or an *imminent* timeline (like ""tonight"" or ""right now"") that would elevate it to 'Behavior'. The ""now"" is rhetorical/contemplative rather than an action statement. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes, the writer claims ownership of the thought: ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal. The ""Fuck me"" reinforces the self-directed negative sentiment.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm going to kill myself."" This indicates a current state of intent.
    *   **Future ideation:** While ""going to"" can imply future, in this context, without a specific timeline like ""tonight"" or ""right now,"" it functions as a statement of current suicidal desire rather than an imminent plan. It's not non-specific like ""someday,"" but also not immediate.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. (Rule: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation)
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself.""
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No. ""I'm going to kill myself"" is not as immediate as ""tonight"" or ""right now."" It expresses intent, but not *imminent* action.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself."" This is an explicit wish to die/end life.
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. This fits the criteria for Ideation.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is explicit active suicidal desire.

**Conclusion:** The post clearly states ""I'm going to kill myself,"" which is an explicit expression of suicidal desire. However, it does not include a specific method, evidence of preparation, or an imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""right now""). Therefore, it falls under the definition of Ideation.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** None.
*   **Indirect death references:** ""smell of a Dead Body"" refers to an external perception, not the writer's state. ""I just wanna leave this place,"" ""I want to leave"" refer to the physical location (apartment), not life. No other indirect death references.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:**
    *   General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair: **YES**. The post clearly conveys extreme distress, exhaustion, and a sense of being trapped in a torturous situation.
    *   Metaphorical death references: No, ""leave this place"" is literal for the apartment.
    *   Rejected/intrusive thoughts: No suicidal thoughts to reject.
    *   NO expressions of active suicidal desire: **YES**. The post expresses a desire to escape the *situation* (""leave this place""), not to end life. ""I can't take this torture"" expresses extreme distress but not suicidal intent.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**

    *   Emotional markers: ""My parents don't love me"", ""I have nobody"", ""I'll never be a real woman"", ""don't know why I cling onto 'hope'"", ""don't even know who I am anymore"". These indicate profound hopelessness, worthlessness, isolation, and identity distress.
    *   Specific methods: None mentioned.
    *   Preparations: ""Possible suicide date is in July"" suggests a future-oriented thought process regarding suicide, which is a form of ideation, but not a concrete preparation like acquiring means or writing a note.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""Possible suicide date is in July."" This is presented as the writer's own thought/potential plan.
    *   Passive experience: Not passive.
    *   Rejection noted? ""Too bad I'm fucking debating it because of my friends."" This indicates internal conflict and hesitation due to external factors (friends), but it is *not* an explicit rejection or disavowal of the suicidal desire itself (e.g., ""I don't actually want to die""). The desire/idea is still present and being considered.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: None explicit.
    *   Future ideation: ""Possible suicide date is in July."" This is a future, non-immediate timeline.

        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""Possible suicide date"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No specific method. No concrete preparation (like acquiring pills, writing a note). ""Possible suicide date"" is a timeline, not a preparation.

        *   *Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.*
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, strongly implied by ""Possible suicide date.""
        *   Without plan/immediacy: There is a *vague* future timeline (""July"") but no specific *plan* (method, detailed steps). The ""debating it"" further indicates a lack of firm, actionable plan.
        *   *This fits IDEATION.*
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is explicit suicidal ideation beyond mere distress or rejected thoughts.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so not applicable.
3.  Immediacy trumps: ""July"" is not immediate.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The ""debating it because of my friends"" is hesitation, not an explicit disavowal of the suicidal desire itself. The core suicidal ideation remains. Therefore, it does not downgrade to Indicator.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post explicitly mentions a ""Possible suicide date,"" indicating active suicidal desire. However, this date is in the future (""July"") and there are no specific methods or preparations mentioned. The internal debate (""debating it because of my friends"") shows conflict but does not negate the presence of the suicidal thought. This aligns perfectly with the definition of **Ideation** (active suicidal desire without an actionable plan or immediate timeline).

    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The writer states ""I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts"". This acknowledges the presence of the thoughts.
    *   Passive experience: The thoughts are described as something that happens (""I have suicidal thoughts"").
    *   Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal? **YES.** The post explicitly states: ""but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin"". This is a clear rejection of acting on the suicidal thoughts/desire due to an external factor (religion).

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: None.
    *   Future ideation: ""will probably never kill myself"" (future, but with a strong negative/rejection). ""I can only hope that my life will get better"" (future, hopeful, non-suicidal).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. While ""suicidal thoughts"" are present, the intent to *act* is explicitly rejected.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → No. The desire is immediately negated by the rejection.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Yes. The post describes ""suicidal thoughts"" (distress/ideation) but immediately follows with a strong disavowal of acting on them (""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person""). This fits the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" criterion for Indicator.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator**:
    *   General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair: Yes (""sad"", ""loser"", ""hurts so much"").
    *   Metaphorical death references: N/A (explicit terms used).
    *   Rejected/intrusive thoughts: **YES**. The ""suicidal thoughts"" are present, but the *action* of killing oneself is explicitly rejected due to religious reasons. This aligns with the clarification ""brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to"".
    *   NO expressions of active suicidal desire: The desire to *act* is explicitly negated.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: N/A.
3.  Immediacy trumps: N/A.
4.  Rejection downgrade: **YES.** ""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person"" is a clear rejection of the suicidal act, downgrading it to Indicator.

Based on the explicit rejection of acting on the suicidal thoughts, despite their presence, the classification is Indicator.

    *   Explicit suicide references: None directly.

    *   Emotional markers: ""breakdown"", ""very bad night"", ""wanted to feel something real"" (indicates severe distress).
    *   Specific methods: ""cut myself"" (explicit method of self-harm).
    *   Preparations: Implied by the act of ""trying to cut myself"" (e.g., acquiring a tool).
    *   Past actions: ""I tried to cut myself last night"". This is a direct description of a past action.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: ""I tried to cut myself"". This is an active action taken by the writer.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted? ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"" refers to *prior* desire, not a rejection of the *past act's* intent. The act itself was performed with a specific motivation (""wanted to feel something real"" during a breakdown), which falls under the umbrella of self-harm, often with underlying suicidal ideation or as a coping mechanism for intense distress. The crucial point is that the *action* was taken.

**Category Definition Check:**
*   **Attempt** (Past concrete action)
    *   ""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"" - ""tried to cut myself"" fits this. While the post doesn't explicitly state ""I wanted to die,"" self-harm during a breakdown to ""feel something real"" is a common manifestation of suicidal distress or intent to end pain.
    *   ""Includes interrupted/aborted attempts ('put belt around neck but stopped')"" - ""tried to cut myself"" implies an attempt, even if not completed to a fatal degree, or if the immediate goal was distress relief.
    *   ""Clarification: 'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt"" - This rule is definitive and directly applies.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Attempt is the highest category, and a past attempt is described.
3.  Immediacy trumps: Not applicable as it's a past event.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The statement ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"" refers to prior history, not a rejection of the *past act's* intent. The act *did* occur. The rule ""I don't actually want to"" applies to *current* ideation/behavior, not a completed or attempted past action.

        *   However, the phrase ""plan to kill myself"" signifies an *actionable intent*. It's more than just a wish (""want to die""). A ""plan"" implies a level of commitment and readiness that goes beyond mere ideation. The question ""Why shouldn't i?"" further suggests this plan is active and being considered for execution.
        *   Comparing to definitions:
            *   **Ideation** is ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan."" This post *has* an actionable plan (""plan to kill myself""), so it's not Ideation.
            *   **Behavior** includes ""Intent + Capability"" and ""Expressions of immediate intent."" While not explicitly time-bound to ""tonight,"" a ""plan"" is a strong expression of intent that is actionable. The lack of an explicit method or immediate timeline doesn't downgrade it from Behavior, as the ""plan"" itself implies a significant step beyond just thinking about it. The framework's ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" While not ""tonight,"" ""plan to kill myself"" is a very strong, active intent.

    *   **Irreducible Rules Check:**
        1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
        2.  Temporal hierarchy: N/A (no attempt).
        3.  Immediacy trumps: Not explicitly immediate, but the ""plan"" is a current, active decision.
        4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection.

    The ""plan to kill myself"" is the key element. It elevates the risk beyond simple ideation because it indicates a decided course of action, even if the specifics are not detailed.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""killing yourself""
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""surprise em will h it"", ""make the process, for them, easier"", ""hit all the same however it goes down""
    *   **Emotional markers:** Not explicit emotional distress, but a detached, logistical discussion of an impending suicide.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** The act of considering *how* to inform people implies a preparation for the act itself, even if not a physical one (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The question is about the *logistics* of an impending act.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. The phrasing ""you'll be killing yourself soon"" indicates a decided action, not an intrusive thought. The question is about the *logistics* of this decided action. ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"" explicitly states a lack of desire for intervention and reinforces active intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not applicable.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** No rejection of the suicidal intent itself. Instead, there's a rejection of being stopped.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** The discussion is about an action that is decided and ""soon."" The user is contemplating the immediate future consequences of an impending act.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""soon"" indicates a definitive, near-future timeline, not a vague ""someday.""

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""you'll be killing yourself"".
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** No specific method. However, the discussion about *how* to inform others before the act (""let folks know you'll be killing yourself soon"") implies a level of planning and an imminent timeline. The user is past the point of just wishing to die; they are planning the execution and its social aftermath.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""soon"" is present. While not ""tonight"" or ""right now,"" the context of discussing the logistics of informing people *before* the act strongly implies a concrete plan is in place and the timing is near enough to warrant this logistical consideration. The user is not expressing a general desire to die, but discussing the practicalities of an impending, decided act. This aligns with the ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" ""Soon"" in this context, combined with the planning aspect, functions as an imminent timeline.

    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** This post goes beyond a mere desire. It presents the act as a certainty (""you'll be killing yourself soon"") and is discussing the practicalities surrounding it.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, this is active, decided intent.

**Conclusion:** The post demonstrates explicit suicidal intent (""killing yourself"") and an imminent timeline (""soon""), coupled with a discussion of logistics related to the act (informing others), and a clear rejection of intervention. This combination moves it beyond ideation into the realm of actionable intent.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The phrase ""so I don't kill myself"" indicates a current, active struggle against suicidal urges. However, the subsequent questioning ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"" moves beyond mere struggle or rejection. It shows active contemplation, normalization, and a questioning of the societal taboo, suggesting a weakening of the rejection and an active consideration of suicide as an option. This is not a clear disavowal.
    *   Passive experience: Not passive.
    *   Rejection noted? The initial ""so I don't kill myself"" implies fighting the urge, but the immediate follow-up questioning the ""badness"" of suicide (""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"") indicates that the thought is not being fully rejected, but rather actively explored and potentially rationalized. This is not a clear ""I don't actually want to do it.""

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, the active struggle and questioning/normalizing of suicide indicate strong intent/consideration.
        *   Specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline: No.
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?
        *   Explicit wish to die: While not ""I want to die,"" the combination of actively fighting the urge (""so I don't kill myself"") and then questioning/normalizing suicide (""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"") clearly indicates active suicidal desire and contemplation. The person is actively engaging with the concept of suicide as a personal solution, even if they are currently resisting it. This goes beyond general distress.
        *   Non-actionable methods: Not present, but not required for Ideation if desire is explicit.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Correct.
        *   This fits IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?
        *   This is more than *only* distress or rejected thoughts. The active questioning of suicide's perceived negativity and the ongoing struggle to *not* kill oneself indicate that suicide is a very present and actively considered option, not merely an intrusive thought that is clearly rejected. The nuance of the second sentence pushes it past a simple ""indicator.""

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: N/A.
3.  Immediacy trumps: N/A.
4.  Rejection downgrade: The initial ""so I don't kill myself"" might suggest rejection, but the very next sentence (""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"") actively *questions* that rejection and normalizes suicide. This is not a clear disavowal; it's active contemplation and a weakening of the resolve against suicide. This prevents a downgrade to Indicator.

**Final Decision:** The post displays active contemplation of suicide, a current struggle to prevent it, and a questioning/normalization of suicide, which aligns with the definition of Ideation.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** Yes, ""I want to die"" is a direct statement of desire.
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?** ""but I'm too much of a coward to do it."" This is a statement about a *barrier to action* (lack of courage), not a rejection of the *desire* to die. The desire is explicitly stated and maintained. This is key: it's not ""I want to die, but I don't actually want to,"" but rather ""I want to die, but I can't bring myself to do it."" Therefore, the desire itself is *not* rejected.

    *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""I want to die"").
    *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no method, no preparation, no immediate timeline.
    *   This points to IDEATION.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
    *   No, it's not *only* distress/metaphors. There is an explicit, active desire to die.
    *   The ""coward"" statement is a barrier to *action*, not a rejection of the *desire*. Per the ""Rejection downgrade"" rule, it only downgrades if it's ""I don't actually want to,"" which is not the case here.

**Category Definitions Review:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire. The ""coward"" statement does not negate the desire itself.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'."" ""No preparation or immediate timeline.""
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The statement ""but I'm too much of a coward to do it"" is a barrier to *action*, not a rejection of the *desire*. The desire ""I want to die"" remains active. Therefore, it does *not* downgrade to Indicator.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output one.

Based on the explicit and active desire to die without a specific plan, method, or immediate timeline, and the critical interpretation of the ""coward"" phrase as a barrier to action rather than a rejection of the desire, the classification is Ideation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **Start here → a) Any past suicide attempt described?**
        *   The post states: ""i self-harmed"". In the context of being ""suicidal since i was 9"", this qualifies as a past suicide attempt as per the `Attempt` definition (""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"") and clarification (""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt).
        *   According to the decision tree, if this condition is met, the classification is `ATTEMPT`.

    *   *Self-correction/Double-check with Irreducible Rules:*
        *   The post also contains strong elements for `BEHAVIOR`: explicit intent (""decide to throw myself off a bridge""), specific method (""throw myself off a bridge""), preparation (""Ive planned it all out"", ""locked in the bathroom""), and implied immediate timeline (""Goodbye"", ""last few seconds"").
        *   However, Irreducible Rule #2 states: ""Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation"". This means if elements of both `Attempt` and `Behavior` are present, the higher category (`Attempt`) takes precedence.
        *   The `Attempt` definition also states: ""Overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned."" While ""i self-harmed"" is a general statement, it is a clear mention of a past action with suicidal intent.

    *   Therefore, despite the very strong `Behavior` elements, the presence of a described past suicide attempt and the explicit temporal hierarchy rule dictates the classification.

    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** ""Sayonara."" and ""no reason to live"" strongly convey a desire for death.
        *   **Specific method/preparation:** None.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""Sayonara."" implies a farewell or impending departure, which *can* suggest immediacy. However, it's immediately followed by ""I will eventually die in a much painful way,"" which describes a future, possibly natural, death, rather than an immediate *self-inflicted* act. This ambiguity prevents it from being a clear ""imminent timeline"" for *suicide*. The post expresses a desire for death and a sense of finality, but not a concrete plan or unequivocal immediate intention to *act* on suicidal thoughts.

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → This fits best.
        *   ""Explicit wish to die: 'no reason to live'"" is present.
        *   ""Non-actionable methods: 'painless way'"" (not present, but no specific method either).
        *   ""No preparation or immediate timeline"" (no specific method or preparation, and the immediacy of ""Sayonara"" is diluted by ""I will eventually die"" referring to a natural progression).

    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is active suicidal desire (""no reason to live"").

**Conclusion:** The post expresses profound despair, a desire for an end (""no reason to live""), and a farewell (""Sayonara""). While ""Sayonara"" suggests a sense of finality, the lack of a specific method or an unambiguous statement of immediate *suicidal* intent (e.g., ""I'm doing it tonight"") combined with the reference to an ""eventual"" painful death (which could be natural) places it in Ideation. It's a clear expression of a wish to die, but without the actionable components for Behavior.

**Key Boundary Check:**
*   **Ideation vs. Indicator:** It's not Indicator because there *is* active suicidal desire (""no reason to live"").
*   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** It lacks a specific method, preparation, or an *unambiguous* immediate timeline for a *self-inflicted* act. ""Sayonara"" is strong, but not as direct as ""right now"" or ""tonight"" for *suicide*, and the ""eventually die"" phrase refers to a natural progression, not a suicidal plan.

Crucially, the final sentence ""I'll still be suicidal lol"" explicitly states that the suicidal desire persists despite the moral qualms. This is key: the desire is *not* disavowed.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** The thoughts are current and ongoing (""I'm starting to get envious"", ""I'll still be suicidal"").
    *   **Future ideation:** The desire ""Why can't that be me?"" points to a future state.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""Why can't that be me?"", ""I'll still be suicidal"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit wish to die: Yes, ""Why can't that be me?"" is a clear wish to die. ""I'll still be suicidal"" confirms this desire.
        *   Non-actionable methods: The question ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"" explores the *concept* of a method without specifying one or making it actionable.
        *   No preparation or immediate timeline: Yes.
        *   This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is active suicidal desire, not just distress or rejected thoughts (as the desire is confirmed to persist).

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The rejection is moral/ethical, not a disavowal of the suicidal desire itself. The final statement ""I'll still be suicidal lol"" confirms the desire persists, overriding any potential downgrade to 'indicator' based on the initial moral qualms. The desire is active and acknowledged by the writer.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

The post clearly expresses an active, ongoing desire for death (""Why can't that be me?"", ""I'll still be suicidal lol"") without a specific plan, method, or immediate timeline. The moral conflict expressed does not negate the underlying suicidal desire.

Like at this point I am and have done some bad shit so I'm probably doing there anyways so it shouldn't matter, but I keep worrying about it. The dumb thing is, I do believe in God but I'm not as religious as my parents or anything so I really don't know why this is one of the only things keeping me alive. Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone I know who *is* religious about this cause they just tell me I'm not being a good Christian or that I just need to ""give it to God."". Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff. I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""wants to die"" - Yes, a direct expression of suicidal desire.
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""Idk how to word this without sounding dumb,"" ""feeling really isolated,"" ""can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist."" - Indicates significant distress, isolation, and difficulty coping.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""Am I the only one who wants to die..."" - Yes, the writer claims ownership of the desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** ""this is one of the only things keeping me alive"" - This is a critical statement. While the desire to die is present, the writer explicitly states that a specific fear (fear of hell) is actively *preventing* them from acting on that desire. This functions as a rejection of the *action*, even if the underlying desire persists.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** No immediate plans or timeline stated. The fear of hell is *currently* acting as a deterrent.
    *   **Future ideation:** The desire is present, but the action is being actively prevented.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""wants to die"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   *Conclusion: Not Behavior.*
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""wants to die"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes.
        *   *Initial thought: This looks like Ideation.*

    **Re-evaluation based on Irreducible Rules and Category Definitions:**

    *   **Rule 4: Rejection downgrade:** ""Rejection downgrade: 'I don't actually want to' → indicator"". The statement ""this is one of the only things keeping me alive"" directly implies that despite the desire to die, the writer is actively *not* pursuing suicide due to a specific deterrent (fear of hell). This is a strong form of rejecting the *action* of suicide, even if the *thought* or *desire* is present. It functions similarly to ""I want to die, but I won't do it because X."" This explicit deterrent preventing action aligns with the spirit of the rejection downgrade.

    *   **Indicator Definition:** ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts ('brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to')"" - While not phrased exactly as ""I don't want to,"" the phrase ""this is one of the only things keeping me alive"" signifies that the *action* is being rejected or prevented, despite the desire. It's a clear internal barrier to acting on the suicidal desire.

    *   **Ideation Definition:** ""Explicit wish to die... No preparation or immediate timeline."" While the explicit wish is there, the strong, active deterrent (""keeping me alive"") moves it out of Ideation because it indicates a current, active rejection of the *actionable intent*.

    Given the explicit statement that something is actively ""keeping me alive"" (i.e., preventing the action), this post fits the criteria for a ""rejection downgrade,"" placing it in the Indicator category despite the stated desire to die. The post highlights distress and a desire for death, but also a clear, active barrier to acting on that desire.

473,"I'm 14 and the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother. For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'. I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore, especially with schools re-opening, knowing my teachers will be very hard on us because of on-line school. I need help and I can't get it from anywhere.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""thought of killing myself multiple times"" (past tense).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" (implies a desire to not be alive if not for the brother), ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" (implies potential for not coping, which could lead to death, but not a direct death reference).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""crushed by stress"", ""cried myself to sleep"", ""boring"", ""dealing with a lot of anxiety"", ""getting much worse"", ""crippled by stress and anxiety"", ""no motivation"", ""bottled up"", ""feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off"", ""I need help and I can't get it from anywhere."" (Clear signs of hopelessness, worthlessness, unbearable pain, and feeling overwhelmed).
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None described as an attempt; ""thought of killing myself multiple times"" is past ideation.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The past ""thought of killing myself multiple times"" indicates past active endorsement of suicidal thoughts. However, there is no *present* active endorsement like ""I want to die now.""
    *   **Passive experience:** The phrase ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" suggests a passive struggle to remain alive, rather than an active desire to die *right now*. It highlights a protective factor.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** ""but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now"" acts as a strong protective factor, indicating a *reason not to act* on suicidal thoughts, even if they are present or have been present. This is not an explicit rejection of the *thought* itself, but a powerful counter-force to acting on it.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""thought of killing myself multiple times"" (past ideation), ""For the past 2 years"", ""in 2019"", ""during the pandemic"".
    *   **Present intent:** ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"", ""I need help and I can't get it from anywhere."" These are expressions of severe current distress and a struggle to cope, but *not* explicit present suicidal intent.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""how long I can cope with this anymore"" implies a potential future limit, but not a specific future plan for suicide.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. ""thought of killing myself multiple times"" is ideation, not an attempt.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No. There is no *present* explicit suicide intent, no method, no preparation, and no immediate timeline.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → This is the closest contender. The past ""thought of killing myself multiple times"" fits ideation. However, the *current* state is expressed as ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" and ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother."" This is a critical distinction. The post *doesn't* contain a *present* explicit wish to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). It describes a history of such thoughts and a current, severe struggle to cope, with a stated protective factor.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This aligns best. The post is overwhelmingly about severe distress, anxiety, hopelessness, and feeling overwhelmed. While there's a history of ideation, the *current* language focuses on the struggle to cope (""I don't know how long I can cope"") and the protective factor (""only thing keeping me alive""), rather than an active, present desire to die. The protective factor acts as a strong counter-force, similar to a ""rejection"" of acting on suicidal thoughts, even if the underlying pain is immense. The rule ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" for Indicator is met, as the post does not explicitly state a *current* active desire to die. The phrase ""the only thing keeping me alive"" implies a passive state of being kept alive, rather than an active desire to end life.

**Final Classification Rationale:**
The post describes significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a history of suicidal ideation (""thought of killing myself multiple times""). However, it *lacks a present, explicit statement of suicidal desire* (e.g., ""I want to die now""). Instead, the current state is characterized by an overwhelming struggle to cope (""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"") and the presence of a strong protective factor (""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother""). This protective factor, while highlighting the severity of the situation, acts as a reason *not to act* on any potential underlying suicidal thoughts, which aligns with the ""rejection downgrade"" principle for Indicators. The post is primarily a cry for help from someone in severe distress, but it doesn't cross the threshold into active, present suicidal intent as defined for ""Ideation"" or higher categories.

    *   Specific methods: None stated, but actively *seeking information* on methods.
    *   Preparations: None explicitly stated as completed, but the question ""Where can I find out how to die"" is a preparatory *action* to acquire means/knowledge.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""I just want to definitely die"" and ""Where can I find out how to die"" clearly indicate active, personal desire and intent.
    *   Passive experience: No.
    *   Rejection noted?: No.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.

    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""I just want to definitely die.""
        *   Specific method/preparation: While no specific method is *named* or *acquired*, the act of ""Where can I find out how to die"" is a direct, active step towards *acquiring* a method or preparation. This goes beyond mere ideation (a wish) and constitutes a concrete step towards capability, even if the capability isn't fully realized yet. It's a ""critical expansion"" of behavior, as it's an immediate intent to find the means, even without a specific method yet.
        *   Immediate timeline: While not ""tonight"" or ""now,"" the active search for *how* to die implies an immediate need to gain the knowledge/means to act. This active seeking pushes it beyond simple ideation.

    *   **Category Decision:**
        *   **Indicator:** No, this is beyond general distress or rejected thoughts.
        *   **Ideation:** No, this is more than just an ""explicit wish to die"" or ""non-actionable methods."" The user is actively seeking *actionable information* to fulfill the desire.
        *   **Behavior:** Yes. The post demonstrates strong, active suicidal intent (""I just want to definitely die"") combined with a concrete step towards capability (""Where can I find out how to die""). This active search for means/methods is a preparatory action that aligns with the ""Behavior"" category, which includes intent + capability, and preparatory evidence. It's an immediate intent to move towards action by acquiring the necessary knowledge.
        *   **Attempt:** No past attempt described.

    *   The active search for ""how to die"" is a strong indicator of moving towards action/capability, even without a named method or immediate timeline. It's a proactive step to facilitate the act.

    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I just don't really want one either"" (a future). ""I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die."" ""If I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail."" These show active suicidal desire and a determination to succeed in a future attempt.

These statements indicate a *postponement* or *delay* of action, but *not* a rejection of the underlying ""will to die"" or the future intent to attempt. The desire is present and acknowledged as familiar. The intent to succeed (""not going to fail"") is strong for a future attempt.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

    *   Therefore, the presence of a past attempt is the dominant factor.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post explicitly states ""if I do attempt again,"" which directly indicates a past suicide attempt. According to the framework's decision tree and irreducible rules, a past attempt takes precedence over any current ideation or future plans, even if the intent for a future attempt is present and strong.

    *   **Specific method:** Yes, ""gun to the head"" (though delayed for this method), and crucially, ""kitchen knife"" (which is immediately accessible and being considered due to inability to wait).
    *   **Preparation:** ""Going by my plan"" implies a plan, even if the primary method is distant.
    *   **Imminent timeline:** Yes. The phrase ""But I can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there"" clearly indicates an immediate, escalating, and actionable intent. This overrides the 480-day future plan for the gun. The ""can't wait any more"" combined with the specific, accessible method (""kitchen knife"") and the escalating temptation (""Each day I've been more tempted"") signifies an imminent risk.

This post meets the criteria for **Behavior** due to explicit suicidal intent, specific methods being considered, and a clear expression of immediate, escalating urgency (""can't wait any more"") despite a longer-term plan for a different method. The immediate temptation with an accessible method (""kitchen knife"") pushes it beyond mere ideation.

This indicates a strong desire to *live* and overcome these thoughts.
*   **Passive experience:** The phrasing ""Did anyone having thoughts of suicide benefit from inpatient care?"" suggests the user is either experiencing such thoughts or is considering the possibility for themselves, but the intent is to *seek a solution to live*, not to act on the thoughts.

*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**
    *   General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair: Yes, ""can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do"" indicates distress and low self-worth.

1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no higher categories are met.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The explicit statements ""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"" and ""convincing myself I deserve to live"" strongly indicate a rejection of suicidal intent, aligning with the 'indicator' category.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post clearly expresses distress, a struggle with self-worth, and mentions ""thoughts of suicide."" However, crucially, it explicitly states a desire to *live* and seeks information about how to achieve that (inpatient care, medication). There is no active desire to die, no plan, no method, and no immediacy.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I'm really going to try and kill myself""
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""No future""
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""Another day of being mute,"" ""Everyday is the same,"" ""Nothing to say ever,"" ""Can't sleep,"" ""No future,"" ""40 and unemployed"" (indicating hopelessness, despair, worthlessness).
    *   **Specific methods:** ""Bridge."" (implies jumping)
    *   **Preparations:** The statement ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge."" acts as a concrete plan, which falls under preparation/intent to act.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I'm really going to try and kill myself"" - Yes, the writer claims ownership and expresses active intent.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday."" - This is a clear, specific, and imminent future intent.
    *   **Future ideation:** The ""on Monday"" makes it specific and time-bound, moving it beyond general future ideation.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → Yes.
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** ""I'm really going to try and kill myself""
        *   **Specific method:** ""Bridge.""
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""on Monday"" (This is a specific, imminent timeline within days, qualifying as ""imminent"" for the Behavior category).

    *   Therefore, the classification is **BEHAVIOR**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicide intent, specific method, and imminent timeline.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is a specific method (""Bridge"") and an imminent timeline (""on Monday""), which goes beyond just a wish to die or non-actionable methods.
*   **Behavior:** This fits perfectly. It includes a specific method (""Bridge""), and an imminent timeline (""on Monday""). The ""Critical expansion"" notes that ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details,"" but this post has *both* immediate intent (on Monday) *and* method details (Bridge).
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes a future plan, not a past action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, the post is entirely about the writer's thoughts and plans.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not an attempt, but a clear future plan, so Behavior is appropriate.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** ""on Monday"" is an imminent timeline.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of the thoughts.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""kms"" (kill myself) appears multiple times. ""when I do it"", ""before I go"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""hangman's noose"" (wallpaper).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""so hard"", ""one of the hardest decisions"", ""HARDDD"".
    *   **Specific methods:** ""hangman's noose"" is mentioned as a visual aid/reinforcement, not explicitly *the* chosen method, but implies a method.
    *   **Preparations:**
        *   ""Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track."" - Mental reinforcement/preparation.
        *   ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms."" - Implies a significant obstacle to carrying out suicide has been removed, increasing capability/readiness.
        *   ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it."" - This is a clear act of ""getting affairs in order"" or making arrangements, which is a form of preparation.
    *   **Past actions:** No past suicide attempt described. ""Tried to sleep"" is unrelated.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms,"" ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it,"" ""One of the hardest decisions I've taken iny life."" The ""Wish I have more sex before I go though lol"" also indicates a definite future action.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted?** ""Good fore to stay away though. Not cool to start something and then just kms. Gah but it's so hard."" This indicates internal conflict and hesitation about the *implications* or *timing* of the act, but *not* a rejection of the suicidal desire or plan itself. The ""so hard"" refers to the difficulty of the *decision to kms*, not a decision to *not* kms.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms."" (Past action related to future suicide).
    *   **Present intent:** ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it."" (Current state of readiness/preparation). ""One of the hardest decisions I've taken iny life."" (Current decision-making).
    *   **Future ideation:** ""when I do it"", ""before I go"". The timing is not immediate (""tonight"", ""right now"") but it's presented as a definite future action.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""kms"", ""when I do it"", ""before I go"").
        *   **Specific method:** ""hangman's noose"" wallpaper is a visual reinforcement, but not explicitly stated as *the* method.
        *   **Preparation evidence:** YES.
            *   ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" implies a significant step towards capability/readiness for the act.
            *   ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" is a concrete action of making arrangements/getting affairs in order, which is a strong indicator of preparation.
            *   ""Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track"" is a form of mental preparation/reinforcement.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** No.

    **Category Definitions Check:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicidal desire and clear preparation.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is significant ""preparation evidence."" Ideation is defined as ""without actionable plan,"" but this post describes actions taken *in preparation*.
    *   **Behavior:** Fits well. It has ""Intent + Capability"". The post includes ""Preparation evidence"" (""overcame a big hurdle,"" ""sure my mom won't be on the street,"" ""set wallpaper""). While there isn't an *immediate* timeline, the presence of concrete preparations (arranging for mom's well-being, overcoming a hurdle) pushes it beyond mere ideation. The ""Critical expansion"" for Behavior notes that ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details,"" but the core definition also includes ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note."" The arrangements for the mom and overcoming a hurdle are analogous to ""writing a note"" or taking steps to facilitate the act.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempt is described.

    **Irreducible Rules Check:**
    1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, all analysis is on the writer's actions/thoughts.
    2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
    3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable as no immediate timeline is present.
    4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No full rejection; only conflict/hesitation about implications, not the core desire.
    5.  **Output exactly one:** Will ensure this.

    The presence of clear preparation (overcoming a hurdle, making arrangements for mom) makes ""Behavior"" the most appropriate category, as it signifies steps taken towards carrying out the act, even if the final timing is not immediate.

480,I want to die. I wanna stop hearing my thoughts and feeling this pain. my mind always feels like clutter and I don't know what's wrong with me. I can never get sleep or think straight. yet i've only been diagnosed with depression. I feel like I wasn't supposed to be born. I stick out but not in a good way. I don't know how to undo the mess i've done with my life. I haven't been happy in 2 years now. it just seems like my adulthood is all downhill from here. I don't have any passions or desires i'm not good at anything. I can't even have a normal high schooler job without feeling so much anxiety that I have to quit because I couldn't stop crying. i'm a failure.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""I want to die."" (initial statement), ""I don't want to die"" (later statement, a rejection).
    *   Indirect death references: ""stop hearing my thoughts and feeling this pain"", ""don't want to be me anymore"", ""seen enough of my future to want to continue"" (implies not wanting to continue living).

These indicate significant hopelessness, worthlessness, and unbearable psychological pain.
    *   Specific methods: None.
    *   Preparations: None.
    *   Past actions: None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Initially ""I want to die.""
    *   Rejection noted? YES. The statement ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore"" is a crucial explicit disavowal of active suicidal desire, even while expressing profound distress and a desire to escape their current self/life.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: ""haven't been happy in 2 years"", ""mess i've done with my life"" (describing past distress, not past suicide actions).
    *   Present intent: ""I want to die"" (initial), ""I don't want to die"" (present rejection). No immediate plans.
    *   Future ideation: ""seen enough of my future to want to continue"" (implies not wanting a future, but not a specific plan to end it).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) → No specific method/preparation or immediate timeline. The intent is also contradicted.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → The initial ""I want to die"" fits here, *but* the later explicit rejection (""I don't want to die"") is paramount.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This aligns best. The post is full of general unhappiness, hopelessness, and despair. The initial ""I want to die"" is directly followed by ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore."" This falls under the ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" clarification for 'Indicator', and the ""Rejection downgrade"" irreducible rule. The desire to ""not be me anymore"" is a strong expression of distress and a desire for escape, but not an active suicidal desire given the explicit rejection.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable (no attempt/behavior).
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable (no immediacy).
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore."" This rule is directly applicable and overrides the initial ""I want to die."" It downgrades the classification to 'Indicator'.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will ensure this.

**Conclusion:** Despite the initial ""I want to die,"" the explicit statement ""I don't want to die"" later in the post, combined with the severe distress and desire to escape their current self, categorizes this as an 'Indicator' according to the framework's rejection rule.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The writer clearly describes their own active participation and intent in all the described actions (""I took"", ""I purchased"", ""I went with the plan"", ""I turned that gas valve""). Even though some actions were aborted due to fear or pain, the initial intent was present. The current statement ""I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time"" does not negate the underlying desire or the active preparation.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not present.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** The writer describes fear, panic, and stopping during the attempts (""scared me"", ""couldn't go through"", ""I gave up"", ""I panicked"", ""I turned off the gas""). However, this is a description of *aborted attempts*, not a rejection of the *idea* of suicide itself. The exit bag is still set up, and the writer expresses fear of it *failing*, implying continued intent.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Multiple detailed descriptions of past actions with suicidal intent (aspirin, gun, rope).
    *   **Present intent/action:** ""Today, I have an exit bag set up."" and ""When I turned that gas valve... I turned off the gas"" describes an initiated and aborted attempt happening today.
    *   **Future ideation:** The current setup of the exit bag implies ongoing potential.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described? → ATTEMPT**
        *   Yes, the post explicitly describes multiple past suicide attempts:
            *   The aspirin overdose at 15 was a completed attempt.
            *   The gun incident at 21 was an initiated action with suicidal intent that was aborted.
            *   The rope/hanging incident ""just recently"" was an initiated action with suicidal intent that was aborted.
            *   The exit bag/gas incident ""today"" was an initiated action with suicidal intent that was aborted.

    *   According to the ""IRREDUCIBLE RULES"", specifically ""Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation"", the presence of any past suicide attempt immediately classifies the post as 'Attempt'. The detailed descriptions of initiated and aborted attempts, as well as one completed attempt, firmly place it in this category.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
*   **Explicit suicide references:** ""face death"", ""until i die"", ""if not, well, you know what happened"" (strong implication of death by self-inflicted means).
*   **Indirect death references:** ""I'm done"", ""embrace the pain"".
*   **Emotional markers:** ""I'm done"", ""too pissed"", ""don't even want to feel good anymore"", ""embrace the pain"" - indicates extreme distress, hopelessness, and a desire to cease feeling.
*   **Specific methods:** ""working out until i die or pass out"" - This is described as a specific, self-harming action intended to lead to death or extreme physical collapse.
*   **Preparations:** ""I'm now gonna start working out"" - Indicates immediate initiation of the described action.
*   **Past actions:** None.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**

*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted?:** No explicit disavowal. The ""if I survived"" acknowledges the risk but doesn't reject the underlying suicidal desire or intent.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** None.
*   **Present intent:** ""I'm now gonna start working out until i die"" - This is an immediate, present plan of action.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** No explicit ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" in the traditional sense, but ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" is a direct query about lethality, strongly implying a suicidal purpose when combined with the next phrase.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""kill you"" is direct.
    *   **Emotional markers:** Implied distress/despair by the nature of the query and the action.
    *   **Specific methods:** ""duloxetine"", ""pills"". This is a specific means.
    *   **Preparations:** ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later."" This is clear evidence of acquiring and reserving means.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** The question ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" combined with the statement ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" indicates active contemplation and preparation for a lethal act. The saving of pills suggests ownership of the intent to use them for this purpose.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not passive.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No rejection or disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** The act of saving pills is present. The query about lethality is present.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""for later"" indicates a non-immediate future timeline.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   Start here →
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Implied by the question about lethality and the act of saving pills for that purpose.
        *   **Specific method:** ""duloxetine"", ""pills"". Yes.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later."" Yes, this is clear preparation (acquiring/saving means).
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""for later"" is not immediate.
        *   *Decision:* Since there is implied explicit suicide intent, a specific method, AND preparation, this qualifies for **BEHAVIOR**. The ""OR"" in the rule means only one of the conditions (method/preparation/immediacy) is needed alongside intent. Here we have two.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to specific method and preparation.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is concrete preparation (saving pills) and a specific method, not just a general wish to die.
*   **Behavior:** Fits perfectly. ""Specific method stated: pills"" (duloxetine pills) and ""Preparation evidence: bought pills"" (saving pills implies acquisition/retention for purpose). The ""for later"" timeline does not downgrade it from Behavior, as the presence of method and preparation is sufficient.
*   **Attempt:** No past action described.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as only one category fits.
3.  Immediacy trumps: ""for later"" is not immediate, but the presence of specific method and preparation overrides this for Behavior.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection.
5.  Output exactly one: Will do.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post demonstrates clear intent to use a specific method (duloxetine pills) for a lethal purpose, evidenced by the direct question about its lethality and the explicit statement of having saved the pills (""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later""). This constitutes both a specific method and preparation, which are key criteria for the Behavior category.

I just want to end but haven't yet.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""I just want to end"" - This is a strong, albeit slightly indirect, expression of a desire to end one's life.
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""If anyone or anything truely cared about my life I know it isn't me. Not anymore."" - Implies a loss of self-care and a detachment from life.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""No really. It's hell."" ""I feel so empty."" ""So out of place"" - Indicate intense despair, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific methods:** None mentioned.
    *   **Preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **Past actions:** ""I just want to end but haven't yet."" - This explicitly states that a past attempt has *not* occurred, but the desire is present.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I just want to end"" - Yes, the writer actively expresses this desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not presented as intrusive thoughts.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** ""but haven't yet"" - This is *not* a rejection of the desire itself. It's a statement of current inaction despite the active desire. The desire to ""end"" is still very much present and endorsed.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** ""haven't yet"" refers to past non-action.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I just want to end"" is a clear present desire.
    *   **Future ideation:** No specific future timing, but the desire is ongoing.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No. The post explicitly states ""haven't yet"".
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""I just want to end"".
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, ""I just want to end"".
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no method, no preparation, no immediate timeline.
        *   This aligns with **IDEATION**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an explicit expression of active suicidal desire (""I just want to end"").
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"" (similar to ""want to end""). ""No preparation or immediate timeline."" This matches the post.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out by ""haven't yet.""

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as only one category clearly fits.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** ""but haven't yet"" is a statement of current inaction, not a rejection of the desire to end. The desire remains active. So, no downgrade.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""dead by the end of the day today"", ""off myself"".
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""Fatigue"", ""brain is my body's worst enemy"" (implies internal struggle/distress).
    *   **Specific methods:** ""buy the gas"" (implies a specific method like self-immolation or carbon monoxide poisoning).
    *   **Preparations:** The post explicitly states a *lack* of preparation (""never leave the house to go buy the gas"") as the current barrier, but the *idea* of acquiring means is present.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today."" This is a clear statement of active suicidal intent. ""I can't off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas"" indicates a desire to ""off myself"" that is currently hindered by a practical obstacle, not a rejection of the intent itself.
    *   **Passive experience:** ""My brain is my body's worst enemy"" suggests some internal conflict, but the primary statements are active.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No explicit rejection of the *desire* or *intent*. The ""putting it off til later"" and ""never leave the house"" are presented as practical barriers/procrastination preventing the *action*, not a disavowal of the suicidal thoughts or wishes.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today."" This indicates an immediate, present-day potential timeline.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes (""dead by the end of the day today"", ""off myself"").
        *   **Specific method:** Yes (""buy the gas"").
        *   **Preparation:** No *actual* preparation, but the *discussion* of needing to acquire means for a specific method is present, and the lack of it is the only stated barrier.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** Yes (""by the end of the day today"").

    Based on the presence of explicit intent, a specific method, and an imminent timeline, the classification leans towards **Behavior**. The fact that the person is only held back by procrastination/fatigue from acquiring the means for a *specific* method *today* indicates a high level of risk.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit active suicidal desire, specific method, and immediate timeline.
*   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is a specific method (""buy the gas"") and an immediate timeline (""by the end of the day today""), which moves it beyond general ideation.
*   **Behavior:** This fits well.
    *   ""Specific method stated: pills, cutting, jumping location"" -> ""buy the gas"" fits this.
    *   ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"" -> ""by the end of the day today"" fits perfectly.
    *   The ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"" is also met, and in this case, method details are *also* present. The obstacle is practical, not a change in intent.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** ""by the end of the day today"" is immediate and points to Behavior.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The post does not reject the *desire* or *intent*, but rather describes practical obstacles to *acting* on that intent. The intent remains.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'behavior'.

*   **Indirect death references:** None.
*   **Emotional markers:** Self-deprecating (""pussy""), impatience/frustration (""suck it up and do it already"").
*   **Specific methods:** None.
*   **Preparations:** None.
*   **Past actions:** ""I post about suicide constantly"" (describes a pattern of communication, not an attempt).

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
*   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" clearly express an active internal desire and pressure to act on suicidal thoughts. There is no passive experience or rejection.
*   **Passive experience:** No.
*   **Rejection noted?** No. The ""should"" implies a strong self-directive to overcome hesitation and execute the suicidal act.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
*   **Past focus:** ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to past communication, not a past attempt.
*   **Present intent:** The ""should... do it already"" indicates a current internal push towards action.
*   **Future ideation:** No specific future timing.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**

    *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, ""I should... do it.""
    *   **Specific method/preparation:** No method or preparation mentioned.
    *   **Immediate timeline:** No explicit immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). ""Already"" implies impatience but not a concrete, imminent plan for *this moment*.
*   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**
    *   **Explicit wish to die:** Yes, ""I should... do it"" strongly conveys an active desire to die by suicide.
    *   **Non-actionable methods:** No method mentioned, so it's non-actionable.
    *   **No preparation or immediate timeline:** Correct.
*   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is active, endorsed suicidal desire.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear, active suicidal desire (""I should... do it"") without specifying a method, preparation, or an immediate timeline. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation. It does not meet the criteria for Behavior due to the lack of a specific method, preparation, or explicit imminent timeline. It is more than just distress or rejected thoughts, ruling out Indicator. There is no past attempt.

So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November.

    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → While ""I wish I was never born"" expresses a desire for non-existence, the immediate follow-up ""don't really want to die"" acts as a strong rejection, preventing it from being classified as active suicidal desire (Ideation).
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → This fits. The post expresses general unhappiness, hopelessness, and crucially, contains a rejected thought regarding death.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
*   **Rejection downgrade: ""I don't actually want to"" → indicator.** This rule directly applies due to ""don't really want to die.""

Based on the framework, particularly the presence of the explicit rejection of the desire to die, this post falls into the 'Indicator' category.

493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** None.
    *   **Indirect death references:** None.
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""ashamed"", ""fucked up"" (referring to his action), ""afraid"", ""disgusting"" (his perception of how others see him). These indicate significant distress, shame, and anxiety.
    *   **Specific methods:** None.
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None related to suicide.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** No active suicidal thoughts or desires expressed. The writer is seeking advice on how to handle a difficult social situation and shame.
    *   **Passive experience:** No mention of intrusive thoughts about death or suicide.
    *   **Rejection noted?:** Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are present to reject.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** Describes past actions (buying the item, starting Nofap, people knowing).
    *   **Present intent:** Expresses current shame and asks ""What do I do..."". This is a request for advice on a social problem, not a suicidal statement.
    *   **Future ideation:** Expresses fear about future social interactions (""afraid of everyone will think of me"", ""They will know about it for sure"").

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No explicit suicide intent.
    *   **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit suicide desire.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post is filled with distress (""ashamed"", ""afraid"", ""disgusting"") but lacks any explicit or implicit suicidal intent, desire, or plan. It fits the ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" part of the Indicator definition.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, analyzed the writer's own emotional state and requests.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as no suicidal content.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** Not applicable.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** Not applicable.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will output 'indicator'.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses significant emotional distress, shame, and anxiety about social judgment, but it contains no language that suggests suicide, death, or self-harm in any form. It is a plea for help with a social/emotional problem, not a suicidal crisis.

494,families are really selfish. they bought u into this world and then you suddenly get sick of it. and they dont let you kill yourself. what kind of an asshole move is that?why do you want me to suffer just for your well being and your pleasure? what the fuck is wrong with you?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""kill yourself""
    *   Indirect death references: ""get sick of it"" (referring to life)
    *   Emotional markers: ""selfish"", ""suffer"", ""asshole move"", ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"" (anger, frustration, feeling trapped, despair)
    *   Specific methods: None
    *   Preparations: None
    *   Past actions: None

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: The phrase ""they don't let you kill yourself"" strongly implies the writer's active desire to ""kill yourself."" The subsequent questions (""why do you want me to suffer just for your well being and your pleasure?"") reinforce the writer's wish to end their suffering, which is linked to the desire for suicide.
    *   Passive experience: Not passive.
    *   Rejection noted?: No explicit rejection. The complaint is that *others* prevent the act, not that the writer doesn't want to do it.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: None.
    *   Present intent: The desire to ""kill yourself"" is presented as current, but without an immediate timeline.
    *   Future ideation: Not explicitly future-focused.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes, as identified in Intent Analysis.
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: No.
        *   Therefore, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy →
        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes, ""they don't let you kill yourself"" clearly indicates this.
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no method, preparation, or immediate timeline is mentioned.
        *   This points to IDEATION.
    *   d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → No, there is an active, albeit implicitly stated, suicidal desire.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there *is* an expression of active suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation:** Fits perfectly. There is an explicit wish to die (""kill yourself"") without a specific actionable plan or immediate timeline.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out due to no description of past action.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes, the analysis focuses on the writer's implied desire.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as only one category (Ideation) fits.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** No rejection of the suicidal thought is present; the rejection is from others preventing the act.

The core of the post is the writer's desire to ""kill yourself"" and frustration at being prevented, which constitutes active suicidal desire without a plan or immediacy.

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   Explicit suicide references: ""pls fucking end me"" (direct plea for death/suicide).
    *   Indirect death references: ""before the day"" (implies an urgent timeline for this desired outcome).
    *   Emotional markers: ""lonely"", ""nobody fucking cares"", ""spoiled piece of shit"" (hopelessness, worthlessness, despair).
    *   Specific methods: None stated.
    *   Preparations: None stated.
    *   Past actions: None stated.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   Active endorsement: Yes, ""pls fucking end me"" is an active expression of suicidal desire/intent.
    *   Passive experience: Not passive.
    *   Rejection noted?: No rejection or disavowal.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   Past focus: No.
    *   Present intent: ""pls fucking end me before the day"" indicates an immediate or very near-future desire/timeline.
    *   Future ideation: Not non-specific.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   a) Any past suicide attempt described? → No.
    *   b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline) →
        *   Explicit suicide intent: Yes (""pls fucking end me"").
        *   Specific method/preparation: No.
        *   Immediate timeline: Yes (""before the day"").
        *   This path leads to **BEHAVIOR**.

**Category Definitions Check:**
*   **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal desire.
*   **Ideation**: Ruled out because there is an immediate timeline (""before the day""). Ideation definition states ""No preparation or immediate timeline"".
*   **Behavior**:
    *   ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"": ""before the day"" fits this criterion.
    *   ""Critical expansion: Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details"": ""pls fucking end me before the day"" perfectly matches this.
*   **Attempt**: Ruled out as no past action is described.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  Writer-focused: Yes, analyzing the writer's own statements.
2.  Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt is mentioned.
3.  Immediacy trumps: ""before the day"" (immediacy) confirms Behavior over Ideation.
4.  Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.
5.  Output exactly one: Will output one category.

The presence of explicit suicidal intent (""pls fucking end me"") combined with an imminent timeline (""before the day"") directly aligns with the definition and critical expansion for 'Behavior'.

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
    *   **Explicit suicide references:** ""with a suicide"" (mentioned as something to avoid being labeled as, but in the context of wanting to die).
    *   **Indirect death references:** ""hope it'll be me next"" (referring to being a victim of a stabbing), ""Wouldn't have to bring shame... it'll be just another stabbing and thats that"" (expresses a desire for death as a solution to shame, and a preference for a specific *type* of death to avoid social stigma).
    *   **Emotional markers:** ""shame in the family"" (indicates distress, feeling like a burden).
    *   **Specific methods:** ""stabbings"" (this is the desired *means* of death, though passively sought).
    *   **Preparations:** None.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** ""I hope it'll be me next"" is an active, explicit wish for death. The desire to avoid the ""shame... with a suicide"" indicates that the underlying intent is suicidal (i.e., wanting to die to escape a situation/feeling), but the individual wishes for a different *label* for their death. The desire for death is clear and owned.
    *   **Passive experience:** Not passive.
    *   **Rejection noted?** No rejection.

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** None.
    *   **Present intent:** ""I hope it'll be me next"" indicates a current desire.
    *   **Future ideation:** ""Next"" implies a future event, but the *desire* is present. It's not a vague ""someday,"" but a hope for a specific, imminent (though externally driven) event.

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**
        *   **Explicit suicide intent:** Yes, the desire for death to avoid shame, even if by external means, is a form of suicidal ideation. The post directly contrasts the desired outcome (death by stabbing) with ""suicide"" to avoid stigma, confirming the underlying suicidal desire.
        *   **Specific method:** ""Stabbing"" is a specific method. However, the examples given for ""Behavior"" (pills, cutting, jumping location) imply *self-initiated* actions. Hoping to be a victim of a stabbing is not an action taken by the individual.
        *   **Preparation:** No.
        *   **Immediate timeline:** ""Next"" is not as immediate as ""tonight"" or ""right now"" as per the ""Behavior"" definition.

    *   **Analysis of Behavior vs. Ideation:**
        *   The post expresses a clear *wish to die* (""I hope it'll be me next""). This aligns with **Ideation** (""Explicit wish to die"").
        *   While a ""specific method"" (""stabbing"") is mentioned, it's not an *actionable plan* initiated by the individual. The individual is expressing a desire for death via an external event, not planning to *commit* the act themselves. The ""Behavior"" category's examples (pills, cutting, jumping) all imply direct, self-inflicted action.
        *   The lack of an immediate timeline (""next"" vs. ""tonight/now"") also pushes it away from ""Behavior"" and towards ""Ideation"" based on the ""Key boundary"" clarification for Ideation.

    *   Therefore, the post fits **Ideation** best: it expresses an active suicidal desire with a specific (though passively sought) method, but without an actionable plan or immediate self-initiated intent. The desire for death is clear, and the explicit mention of ""suicide"" in the context of what they want to avoid being labeled as confirms the underlying suicidal thought process.

    *   **Emotional markers:** ""0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money"" (hopelessness, worthlessness, despair).
    *   **Specific methods:** None. The ""disappear"" is a precondition for the act, not the method of suicide itself.
    *   **Preparations:** None. The idea of going to another country/new identity is a hypothetical future condition, not a current preparation.
    *   **Past actions:** None.

2.  **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Active endorsement:** Yes. ""i will go straight to the point"", ""i want to put an end to it all"", ""how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace"". The writer actively owns the desire.
    *   **Passive experience:** No.
    *   **Rejection noted? Explicit disavowal?:** The post states ""there is something blocking me to do that and ots my family"". This is an *obstacle* or *blocker* to the act, not a *rejection* or disavowal of the suicidal desire itself. The subsequent question ""how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace"" indicates a desire to *overcome* this blocker to achieve the suicide, rather than abandoning the intent. This is not equivalent to ""I don't actually want to"".

3.  **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
    *   **Past focus:** No.
    *   **Present intent:** No immediate timeline (""tonight"", ""right now"").
    *   **Future ideation:** Yes. The desire is present, but the execution is contingent on a major future action (disappearing, new identity).

4.  **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
    *   **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** No.
    *   **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**

        *   Specific method: No.
        *   Preparation: No.

        *   Explicit suicide desire: Yes (""kill myself"", ""want to put an end to it all"").
        *   Without plan/immediacy: Yes, no specific method, no preparation, and no immediate timeline. The desire is contingent on a future, non-immediate action (disappearing).
        *   This matches IDEATION.
    *   **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, there is explicit suicidal desire. The ""blocker"" is not a rejection of the desire.

**Category Definitions with Key Clarifications Review:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is explicit active suicidal desire, not just distress or rejected thoughts. The ""blocker"" is not a rejection of the desire.
*   **Ideation:** ""Explicit wish to die: 'want to die'"". Yes, ""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all"". ""No preparation or immediate timeline"". Yes. This fits perfectly.
*   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to lack of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action is described.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES Check:**
1.  **Writer-focused:** Yes.
2.  **Temporal hierarchy:** Not applicable as only one category is identified.
3.  **Immediacy trumps:** No immediacy present.
4.  **Rejection downgrade:** The ""blocker"" is an obstacle to action, not a rejection of the *desire*. The desire to ""kill myself with peace"" after disappearing confirms the ongoing intent. Thus, no downgrade to Indicator.
5.  **Output exactly one:** Will do.

The post clearly expresses an active, explicit desire to die, but without a concrete plan, specific method, or immediate timeline. The mention of family as a ""blocker"" is an impediment to execution, not a disavowal of the suicidal intent itself.
