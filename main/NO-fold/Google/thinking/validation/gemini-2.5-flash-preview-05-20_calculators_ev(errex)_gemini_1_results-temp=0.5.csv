0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** Does the post describe a *past* act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post says ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off."" These refer to current thoughts and future desires/plans, not a completed or aborted past action.
    *   Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** Yes, ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" clearly indicate suicidal ideation.
    *   **Plan components:**
        *   **Method:** ""jump off"" implies a method.
        *   **Timing:** Not specified.
        *   **Location:** ""a bridge"" is a specific location.
        *   **Preparation:** Not specified.
    *   Since the post includes both suicidal ideation and components of a plan (method and location), it fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** (This step is skipped because 'Behavior' was identified, which is a higher risk category). If no plan was present, would it be Ideation? Yes, ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" clearly express a desire to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** (This step is skipped because 'Behavior' was identified). The user is expressing a desire to act, not rejecting intrusive thoughts.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** (This step is skipped because 'Behavior' was identified).

**Hierarchy Rule Application:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation and elements of a plan (method and location). According to the hierarchy, the presence of a plan elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior.

**Final Classification:** The post meets the criteria for 'Behavior' due to the explicit suicidal ideation combined with a specific method (""jump off"") and location (""a bridge"").

Final Classification: behavior",behavior,True
1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post is ""I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon"".

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not Attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a desire to die (""I'm going to die soon""), but it does not mention a specific method, timing (beyond the vague ""soon""), location, or preparatory action. ""Soon"" is not considered a concrete enough timing for a plan, as per the provided examples (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""). Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" directly expresses an expectation or desire to no longer be alive. This aligns with the definition of Ideation, which includes phrases like ""I'm going to die soon"" as an example.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting the thought; they are stating it as an expectation.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since Ideation fits, it's not an Indicator by default.

Based on the provided examples, the exact phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" is classified as Ideation.
</thinking>

Final Classification: ideation",ideation,True
2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post: ""I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not mention any method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to ending one's life. So, it's not ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I hate living"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to no longer be alive. The subsequent sentence ""sometime i think about why i have to live until now"" reinforces this sentiment by questioning the value or purpose of continued existence. This goes beyond general sadness or distress.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user does not state that these thoughts are unwanted, intrusive, or that they do not agree with them. The statement ""I hate living"" is presented as a personal feeling.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since an active suicidal desire is present (""I hate living""), it does not default to ""Indicator"" for general distress.

5.  **Hierarchy Check:**
    *   No past attempt is described. (Not Attempt)
    *   No plan is described, but active desire is present. (Not Behavior, but fits Ideation)
    *   Active desire is present and not negated. (Fits Ideation, not Indicator)

Therefore, the post expresses a clear desire to not be alive without a concrete plan, which aligns with the definition of ""Ideation.""
</thinking>

Final Classification: ideation",ideation,True
3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It is a current request for assistance.
2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""Help me kill myself"" is a direct and active expression of suicidal desire.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan? Yes, ""help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal"" explicitly mentions a specific method (barbiturates/Nembutal) and a preparatory action (finding them).
    *   Since both active suicidal desire and a component of planning (method/preparation) are present, the classification is Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is superseded because Behavior was identified.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is superseded because Behavior was identified.

Based on the hierarchy, Behavior is the highest risk category identified.

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is asking for a classification of suicide risk based on the provided post. I need to follow the hierarchical classification system: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""Is there a painless way to die,"" and ""I want to sleep forever.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? The user asks ""Is there a painless way to die"" and states ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" This indicates an active search for a method. While not a concrete method they *have* decided on, the *inquiry* about a method and the desire for a *certain type* of method (painless, certain) constitutes a component of planning. The definition of a plan includes ""Method: Mentioning tools, substances, weapons"". An active inquiry about such a method falls under this. Therefore, this fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While there is clear ideation (""I want to sleep forever""), the presence of the inquiry about a method elevates it to 'Behavior'.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** Not applicable as higher categories fit.

Based on the hierarchy, since 'Behavior' criteria are met (suicidal desire + inquiry about a method), the classification is 'Behavior'.

5,"whats the point of living. no really. is there any real reason to keep going that cant just be dismissed by ""none of it will matter when you're dead"". all the things that made me want to kill myself are solved and yet i still want to die because now im just left with the feeling that life is all pointless. for a year straight i was constantly thinking about how nothing matters after you die and how life doesnt really matter and even though nothing in particular in my life is making me want to die anymore i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways. but seriously why shouldnt we just kill ourselves if none of this matters and we wont remember anything at all after we're dead. this all just seems like a huge waste of time.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post expresses a deep sense of nihilism and a personal desire to die.
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: The post does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for suicide. Therefore, it does not fit the 'Behavior' category.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The post contains explicit phrases like ""i still want to die"" and ""i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways."" These directly convey a personal desire to end one's life. The rhetorical question ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"" also stems from this underlying personal desire. This strongly points to 'Ideation'.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user does *not* express that these thoughts are unwanted or that they don't agree with them. On the contrary, they seem to be grappling with and even advocating for these thoughts (""i still want to die,"" ""i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways,"" ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves""). Therefore, it is not an 'Indicator' based on negated thoughts.
4.  **Default to Indicator**: Since active suicidal desire (Ideation) is present, it does not default to 'Indicator'.
5.  **Check for Attempt**: There is no mention of a past suicide attempt or self-harm.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of active suicidal desire without a plan places this post in the 'Ideation' category.
</thinking>

Final Classification: ideation",ideation,True
6,"I want to be gone tonight. I'm in so much mental pain, I want this pain to turn into physical. I want it to be over tonight, I don't wanna survive it. Please, I don't want it to continue, I can't handle it, I want it to stop. I hate everything, I need peace.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It describes current feelings and desires.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan + Suicidal Thoughts):**
    *   **Suicidal Thoughts:** The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive: ""I want to be gone,"" ""I want it to be over,"" ""I don't wanna survive it.""
    *   **Plan Element:** The post specifies a timing: ""tonight"" is mentioned twice. This constitutes a concrete element of a plan.
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and a plan (timing) are present, the post fits the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** This category would apply if there were suicidal thoughts but *no* plan. Because a timing (""tonight"") is present, it's more severe than Ideation.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** This category is for general distress or rejected suicidal thoughts. The user is actively expressing a desire to die with a specific timeframe, so it's not an Indicator.

Based on the hierarchy and definitions, the presence of active suicidal ideation combined with a specific timeframe (""tonight"") elevates the risk to Behavior. This matches the provided example for Behavior.

I'm just sick sick of being worthless sick of acting like every day was perfect sick of acting like I'm good when I'm not sick of putting fake smiles sick of feeling pain sick of waking up everyday knowing I don't have a purpose. I'm so sick n I just wanna die. It's the best for me,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will examine the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to suicide. The post states, ""I just wanna die. It's the best for me,"" but does not include any details about *how* or *when* this might happen. Therefore, there is no plan, and it is not ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life. The post clearly states, ""I'm so sick n I just wanna die. It's the best for me."" This is a direct and active expression of a desire to die.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user expresses suicidal thoughts but then rejects them or states they do not want to act on them. The user's statement ""I just wanna die. It's the best for me"" is an affirmation of the desire, not a negation. Therefore, it is not ""Indicator"" based on this rule.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not reached because an active suicidal desire was identified.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear, active desire to die without any component of a plan. This aligns with the definition of ""Ideation.""

I just feel tired and lonely because of these thoughts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user post explicitly states: ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to.""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: The post does not describe any method, timing, location, or preparation for suicide. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: While the phrase ""telling me to kill myself"" mentions suicidal thoughts, the user immediately negates this desire with ""but I don't actually want to."" This indicates a lack of active suicidal desire. Therefore, it is not Ideation.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The post perfectly fits this criterion. The user mentions suicidal thoughts (""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself"") but clearly rejects them (""but I don't actually want to""). This is characteristic of intrusive or unwanted thoughts, which fall under the Indicator category.
4.  **Default to Indicator**: Since the post contains negated suicidal thoughts and general distress without active desire or a plan, it defaults to Indicator.

This aligns with the provided example: ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to. It's so tiring to try to love yourself when your own mind is against you."" which is classified as 'indicator'.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the established hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempts. It focuses on current feelings and potential future actions. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**:
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""All i know is that i want to call it a day and kill myself for the sake of my family."" and ""Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant"".
    *   It then proceeds to mention potential methods: ""so either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids."" These are specific methods being considered, even if the user expresses uncertainty about which one to choose. The mention of concrete methods constitutes a plan.
    *   Because there is clear suicidal ideation *and* a discussion of methods (a component of planning), the post fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: Yes, this is strongly present (""I want to call it a day and kill myself"", ""I want to die now""). However, the presence of a plan elevates it beyond just Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: No, the thoughts are not negated; they are expressed as a strong personal desire and consideration of action.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of both suicidal ideation and specific methods (a plan) places this post in the 'Behavior' category, which is a higher risk than 'Ideation' or 'Indicator'.

The user is expressing severe distress due to schizo-affective disorder, lack of sleep, and paranoia.
1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan)**: The post states ""I just want to get it over with."" This is an expression of suicidal ideation. I need to check if there's any component of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation). The user says, ""The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last."" While this indicates the user is contemplating an action, it does not specify *what* the action is (method), *when* (timing), *where* (location), or any *preparatory steps*. The phrase ""go through with it"" is vague and refers to the act itself, not a specific plan for it. It's a contemplation of the *consequences* of an action, not the *details* of a plan. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire)**: The phrase ""I just want to get it over with"" is a clear and explicit expression of a desire to end their life or current suffering. This fits the definition of Ideation: ""The post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die, but does not include any concrete plan.""
4.  **Check for Indicator (Negated Thoughts/General Distress)**: The user is not negating their desire to ""get it over with."" They are expressing a direct desire, not an intrusive thought they are fighting against. The post goes beyond general distress to an active desire to end things.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to end their life but lacks any concrete plan. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical classification process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt (aborted or completed). Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post contains the phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"". This expresses a desire to no longer exist. Now, I need to check if there's any element of a plan associated with this desire.
    *   Method: Not mentioned.
    *   Timing: Not mentioned.
    *   Location: Not mentioned.
    *   Preparation: Not mentioned.
    Since there is no mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation, this post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The phrase ""if I could"" indicates a desire, but not a concrete plan.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" clearly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to cease to exist. This goes beyond general sadness or hopelessness. It is a direct expression of a wish for non-existence, even if conditional. It is a personal, active desire.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user does not explicitly state that they do *not* want to act on the thought or that it is an intrusive thought they reject. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" implies a desire to do so, if possible. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator' based on negated thoughts.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post contains a clear expression of a desire to no longer be alive (""I'd leave myself if I could"") and it's not negated, it is stronger than a general indicator of distress.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to cease to exist (""I'd leave myself if I could"") but lacks any concrete planning elements. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   The post states: ""i plan to kill myself at 21, whether i want to or not, i'm 18 now.""
    *   This sentence clearly expresses suicidal intent (""i plan to kill myself"") and provides a specific future timing (""at 21""). This constitutes a plan.
    *   According to the guidelines, the presence of suicidal thoughts and any element of a plan classifies the post as Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is skipped because a plan was identified, which is a higher risk category than Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is skipped because a plan was identified. The user explicitly states ""i plan to kill myself,"" which is not a negated thought.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is skipped as a higher risk category (Behavior) has been identified.

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post states ""I want to die,"" which is ideation. However, it explicitly states, ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case."" This negates any immediate plan or intent. While ""5 more years"" is a timeframe, it's presented as a *delay* or *condition against* immediate action, not a plan *for* it. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The post contains ""I want to die"" and ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence,"" which clearly express a desire to not be alive.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** This is the critical step. The user states ""I want to die"" (suicidal thought) but then immediately follows it with ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case."" This is a clear statement that they do not intend to act on the suicidal thoughts *at this time*. According to the definition of Indicator, ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" This post fits this criterion perfectly. The user is expressing suicidal thoughts but explicitly rejecting immediate action.

I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post mentions a method (""I've considered hanging""). However, it immediately negates the intent to act on it with ""but I can't seem to go through with it"" and ""I don't really have the guts to do it."" The presence of a method is usually a strong sign for Behavior, but the explicit negation of the ability or will to execute it means it does not constitute an active plan.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post expresses a desire to end suffering and sees suicide as ""the only way out"" and ""make my escape."" This would typically point to Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The crucial phrases are ""I don't really have the guts to do it,"" ""I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it,"" and ""I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts."" These statements explicitly indicate that while suicidal thoughts and even a method have been considered, the user is currently unable or unwilling to act on them. This aligns with the definition of Indicator, which includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them. The user is expressing distress and suicidal thoughts, but also a clear lack of current intent to act on them.

**Conclusion:** Despite mentioning a method (""hanging"") and the idea of suicide as an escape, the repeated and explicit negation of the ability or will to act (""don't have the guts,"" ""can't seem to go through with it"") places this post in the Indicator category, as the user is expressing suicidal thoughts they are not currently willing to act on.

1. **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It describes future intent and current preparation.
2. **Check for Behavior (Plan?):**
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** ""i already know i'm going to kill myself and i've decided on it."" - This clearly expresses suicidal ideation.
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Timing:** ""but ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year."" - This sets a timeframe (within the next year).
        *   **Preparation:** ""i already got my suicidal notes ready."" - This is a concrete preparatory action.
    Since both suicidal ideation and elements of a plan (timing and preparation) are present, the classification is Behavior.
3. **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** While active suicidal desire is present, the presence of planning elevates it beyond Ideation to Behavior.
4. **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating their thoughts; they are affirming their decision.
5. **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk categories fit.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of a clear decision to die, a timeframe, and specific preparatory actions (""suicidal notes ready"") places this post firmly in the Behavior category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post expresses extreme self-loathing, body dissatisfaction, and a desire to ""be someone else.""
    *   It does *not* contain any explicit suicidal thoughts or a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I want to end it""). The phrase ""I just wish I could press a button and be someone else"" or ""i just want to be someone else"" expresses a desire for transformation or escape from current self, not a desire for death.
    *   There is no mention of a plan.
    *   Therefore, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die?
    *   The post focuses on self-hatred and body image issues: ""im sick of seeing my face,"" ""i'm tired of having to get dressed and seeing my body,"" ""i feel so ugly and horrible,"" ""i hate everything about myself.""
    *   The phrases ""i just wish i could press a button and be someone else"" and ""i just want to be someone else"" indicate a desire to escape one's current identity or body, but they do not explicitly state a desire for death or non-existence. They are not equivalent to ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead.""
    *   Therefore, it is not Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts:** The post does not mention suicidal thoughts that are then rejected.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since none of the higher categories fit, and the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and significant mental health struggles (severe body image issues, self-hatred), it falls into the Indicator category. This category is for posts showing distress without a stated desire to die.

In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post, focusing solely on the person writing the post.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt by the author?
    *   No. The author is discussing *other people* who post about killing themselves.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation) by the author?
    *   No. The author is asking a question about the motivations of *others* who post about suicide. There is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts or a plan.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die by the author?
    *   No. The author is discussing the actions of *others* (""For anyone that posts that they are going to kill themselves...""). The author is not expressing their own desire to die.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** Does the post show general distress, hopelessness, or discuss suicide thematically but lack a personal, active desire to die? Or does it mention suicidal thoughts that are clearly rejected?
    *   The post *discusses suicide thematically* (""For anyone that posts that they are going to kill themselves or are in the process of doing so..."").
    *   It does *not* express personal distress or a desire to die from the author.
    *   It does *not* mention personal suicidal thoughts that are rejected.
    *   However, the definition of Indicator includes posts that ""discusses suicide thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die."" This post fits this description perfectly, as it's a meta-commentary on the topic of suicide posts, not a personal cry for help or expression of suicidal intent from the author. The risk is zero for the author.

Based on the hierarchy, since there is no personal attempt, behavior, or ideation, and the post discusses suicide thematically without personal intent, it falls into the 'Indicator' category.

18,"No point in existing. When every thing you do and every word that comes out of your mouth hurts the people that you love there's no point in being alive anymore. I don't mean to hurt anyone.

I just want someone to love me and accept me and its never going to happen. I want to be brave enough to kill myself but the past two times ive tried ive failed. Im so tired and sad.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user's post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""No point in existing,"" ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""Im so tired of being alive,"" ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself""). This indicates Ideation.

However, the post also states, ""but the past two times ive tried ive failed."" This is a direct description of past suicide attempts.

According to the classification rules:
-   **Attempt** is defined as: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.""
-   The **Hierarchy Rule** states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""

Since the post explicitly mentions past attempts and also current ideation, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

19,"I honestly couldn't care less if I am some beta male pussy for killing myself. ""Natural selection only the strong live on blah blah."" I don't really care, I don't want to be alive.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I honestly couldn't care less if I am some beta male pussy for killing myself"" and ""I don't want to be alive."" While ""killing myself"" is mentioned, there is no specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action described. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I don't want to be alive"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to no longer be alive. The mention of ""killing myself"" also indicates an active contemplation or desire related to ending one's life. This clearly goes beyond general distress.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not agree with. They are stating their desire (""I don't want to be alive"") as their own sentiment, even if it's framed defiantly. They are not saying ""my brain tells me this but I don't want to.""

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since an active suicidal desire (Ideation) is present, it does not default to Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to not be alive without a concrete plan, fitting the definition of Ideation.

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk of the provided post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months"". This clearly describes past suicide attempts.
2.  **Hierarchy Rule:** The instructions state, ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories (e.g., a past attempt and current plans), you must classify it as the highest risk category present."" Also, ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""
3.  Since the post describes multiple past suicide attempts, this immediately places it in the 'Attempt' category, which is the highest risk level. Even though there is also strong current ideation and a metaphorical ""plan"" (""getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape""), the presence of past attempts takes precedence according to the rules.

Then I think about how many fucking issues I already have and its just too much. I'm going insane what the fuck do I do? My parents would rub in my face about how they were right about me not eating causing me severe issues later on, I'm also scared of being seen weak around them. Please I'm so fucking scared.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not express any suicidal thoughts combined with a plan (method, timing, location, preparation). The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" expresses extreme distress and dependency on HRT, implying that life without it would be unbearable, but it is not a direct statement of suicidal intent or a plan to end their life. It's a statement about a condition for living.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post does not explicitly express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life. Phrases like ""I'm fucking horrified,"" ""keep crying and having panic attacks,"" ""too much,"" ""I'm going insane,"" and ""I'm so fucking scared"" indicate extreme distress, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed. While ""I can't live without estrogen"" is a strong statement of dependency, it's not a direct expression of wanting to die. It's more about the fear of a specific negative outcome and its impact on their ability to live *as themselves*, rather than an active desire for death.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The post does not mention any suicidal thoughts that the user explicitly rejects or states they do not want.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post does not meet the criteria for Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation (as it lacks a direct, active desire to die), it falls into the Indicator category. It clearly shows general distress, hopelessness (feeling ""too much""), and mental health struggles (panic attacks, feeling insane, extreme fear).

Now it's time to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the hierarchical classification process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    The phrase ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" immediately stands out. Given the context of ""There is NO hope left"" and ""Now it's time to end it,"" the word ""tried"" here strongly implies past suicide attempts. The user has exhausted all other options for getting better and is now concluding it's time to ""end it,"" referencing these past ""tries."" This indicates a history of previous attempts.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** (If not an attempt) Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    The phrase ""Now it's time to end it"" expresses active suicidal desire. However, there is no specific plan mentioned (no method, timing, location, or preparation). If it were only this phrase, it would be Ideation. But because of the past attempts, I must consider the highest risk category.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (If not an attempt or behavior) Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    ""Now it's time to end it"" clearly expresses this desire.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** (If none of the above) Does the post show general distress, hopelessness, or discuss suicide thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die, or explicitly rejects suicidal thoughts?
    This is not applicable as there is a clear desire to die and mention of past actions.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:**
The post contains elements of past attempts (""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."") and current ideation (""Now it's time to end it."").
According to the ""Hierarchy Rule: If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""
Therefore, the highest risk category is Attempt.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past actions of self-harm or suicide attempts. It talks about current thoughts and struggles (""Everyday I am trying to survive"").
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post states, ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday."" This indicates suicidal thoughts. However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" clearly indicates a persistent, active preoccupation with suicidal thoughts. This goes beyond general distress and signifies a desire or contemplation of ending one's life, even if there's also a struggle to survive. It's a direct statement about the presence of suicidal thoughts.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** While the user says ""Everyday I am trying to survive,"" this is a statement about fighting against the thoughts, not a negation of the thoughts themselves (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). The core statement ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" indicates active, present suicidal ideation, even if the user is struggling with it. The thoughts are *there* and *active*.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not merely general distress. The explicit mention of ""thinking about suicide everyday"" elevates it beyond a general indicator.

Based on this, the post expresses active suicidal thoughts without a plan or past attempt, fitting the definition of Ideation.

The user post expresses significant distress and a feeling of having ""given up in life.""
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past suicide attempt or self-harm.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post explicitly states, ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April.""
    *   **Method:** ""I have a plan"" implies a method, even if not explicitly detailed.
    *   **Timing:** ""date which will be in early April"" is a specific timeframe.
    *   **Preparation:** ""note"" indicates a preparatory action.
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** ""What's the use."", ""I've given up in life"", ""I'm not scared to die"" clearly express a desire to die.
    Since there is clear suicidal ideation combined with specific elements of a plan (timing and preparation, plus explicit mention of ""a plan""), this classifies as Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This is present (""I'm not scared to die,"" ""I've given up in life""), but the presence of a plan elevates it beyond Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The thoughts are not negated; they are affirmed and accompanied by a plan.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as a higher risk category is identified.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of a plan (timing, preparation, and explicit mention of a plan) combined with suicidal ideation places this post in the Behavior category.

I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post. I will follow the provided thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""given how many cuts I have all over myself."" The definition of 'Attempt' explicitly includes ""non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting."" This indicates a past act of self-harm. The post also contains current suicidal ideation (""or I actually do go through with it and kill myself,"" ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.""). According to the hierarchy rule, ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" This condition is met.

Since 'Attempt' is the highest risk category and elements fitting its definition are present, I do not need to check for Behavior, Ideation, or Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past suicide attempts or acts of self-harm. The user states ""i can't kill myself,"" which refers to a current inability to act, not a past action.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   The post expresses suicidal thoughts: ""Im so tired i can't kill myself.""
    *   It mentions a specific location in the context of these thoughts: ""I know a good clif"".
    *   It even discusses the logistics of reaching this location: ""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there"".
    *   While the user says ""i just can't commit to it,"" the presence of a specific location and the consideration of how to get there, combined with the active suicidal ideation, constitutes a component of planning. The inability to commit doesn't negate the existence of the plan component.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is covered by the Behavior check. The post clearly expresses a desire to ""kill myself.""
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** While the user says ""i can't commit to it,"" they are not rejecting the *thought* of suicide itself, but rather their ability to *act* on it at this moment. The detailed mention of a specific location (cliff) and its distance indicates more than just general distress or rejected thoughts. It shows active consideration of a method and location.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of suicidal ideation (""kill myself"") combined with a specific location (""a good clif"") and consideration of logistics (""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there"") elevates the risk to Behavior, despite the stated inability to commit. The existence of a plan component is key here.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation for a suicidal act.
    *   The post says: ""i'm tired of everything... i just want it all to stop. i wish i was never born. i have nothing going for me in my life.""
    *   There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., tonight, at 21), location (e.g., bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note).
    *   Therefore, this post does not qualify as Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for phrases expressing a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post states: ""i just want it all to stop."" In the context of ""i'm tired of my life,"" ""i'm tired of hating myself,"" and ""i have nothing going for me in my life,"" ""i just want it all to stop"" clearly implies a desire for their existence or suffering to end.
    *   The post also says: ""i wish i was never born."" This is a direct and explicit expression of a desire not to have existed, which aligns with not wanting to be alive.
    *   These phrases indicate an active desire for their current state of being to cease, which fits the definition of Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   There are no phrases like ""my brain tells me to, but I don't want to"" or ""these are intrusive thoughts."" The desire expressed (""i just want it all to stop,"" ""i wish i was never born"") appears to be the user's own active desire.
    *   Therefore, this is not an Indicator due to negation.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is only taken if none of the above categories fit. Since Ideation fits, I will not default to Indicator.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt or self-harm is described.
*   **Behavior:** No plan is mentioned.
*   **Ideation:** The phrases ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born"" clearly express a desire to no longer be alive or for their life to end, without a concrete plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.
*   **Indicator:** The post goes beyond general distress; it expresses a direct desire for their life/suffering to stop.

Based on this analysis, the highest applicable risk category is Ideation.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It speaks of a future desire (""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"").
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   **Method:** No specific method is mentioned (e.g., pills, weapon).
    *   **Timing:** No specific timing is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
    *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:** The post mentions ""have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral"" and ""It's gonna be one last big fuck you."" These describe the *consequences* or *motivation* for the act, not a preparatory action *leading up to* the act (like writing a note *before* the act, or gathering tools). There is no concrete preparatory action described.
    Since no element of a plan is present, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"" is a very clear and explicit expression of a desire to end one's life. It is not general sadness or hopelessness.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not rejecting or disagreeing with the suicidal thoughts; rather, they are expressing an active desire for them.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die without any concrete plan elements. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. ""all ready tried that before"" refers to telling people, not an attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** ""I'm finally ready to just end it all"" clearly expresses a desire to die.
    *   **Plan Elements:**
        *   **Timing:** ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks"" specifies a timeframe.
        *   **Method:** ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" indicates a method is decided, even if not explicitly stated. This implies a concrete plan.
        *   **Preparation:** ""So goodbye everybody"" can be interpreted as a preparatory action, a farewell.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and multiple elements of a plan (timing, known method, farewell), this falls under 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While ideation is present (""end it all""), the presence of planning elevates it beyond just Ideation.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The post expresses active desire and planning, not just general distress or negated thoughts.

Based on the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is the highest applicable risk level.

The user is expressing extreme distress, feelings of being a burden, and suicidal ideation (""they'd be better off without a person like me!"", ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"").

I need to follow the hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post explicitly states, ""I can't even fucking kill my self. I hold the blade but can't fucking do it for what! I should be able to!"". This describes an *aborted attempt* or a significant preparatory action that was not completed, which falls under the definition of ""Attempt"". The definition states: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts (e.g., 'I put the belt around my neck but then stopped')."" Holding a blade with the intent to use it for self-harm, but stopping, fits this description.

2.  **Hierarchy Rule**: Since an aborted attempt is present, according to the hierarchy rule (""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt""), this is the highest risk category. Even though there is strong current ideation, the description of the aborted attempt elevates it to 'Attempt'.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post states ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"". This expresses a desire to die, but it does not include any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The phrase ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"" directly expresses a desire to die. It's a rhetorical question, but it clearly conveys the thought of dying as a potential outcome or desire in response to their situation. This is an active suicidal desire.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The suicidal thought (""how about i die then"") is not negated or rejected by the user. It's presented as a direct, albeit frustrated/sarcastic, consideration. It doesn't say ""I don't actually want to die.""

Based on this, the post expresses an active desire to die without a plan, fitting the definition of Ideation.

The user's post needs to be classified based on the provided suicide risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, explicitly: ""killing myself will happen,"" ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
        *   **Timing:** Yes, ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)."" This sets a clear future deadline, which is a form of timing.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I have this on my computer wallpaper now. It is my daily reminder that killing myself will happen."" This indicates a form of psychological preparation and commitment to the act.
    Since both suicidal ideation and elements of a plan (timing and preparation) are present, the category is 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While active suicidal desire is present (""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life""), the presence of planning elements elevates the risk to 'Behavior'.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not negating or rejecting the suicidal thoughts; rather, they are affirming them as ""100% confirmed."" General distress is present, but it's accompanied by explicit ideation and planning elements.

Based on the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is the highest risk category identified.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down."" This describes a past aborted attempt. The definition of ""Attempt"" includes ""aborted attempts (e.g., 'I put the belt around my neck but then stopped')"". The user describes a past instance where they had an opportunity to kill themselves but ""talked myself down,"" indicating they were close to acting but stopped. This fits the criteria for an aborted attempt.
2.  **Hierarchy Rule:** The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post clearly describes a past aborted attempt and also expresses current ideation (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself""). Therefore, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life.

I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not express any suicidal thoughts or desire to die, therefore, there is no plan (method, timing, location, preparation) to identify. The user talks about relationship issues, feeling weak, and being used, but not about ending their life.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post does not contain phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to end it all,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I'm going to die soon,"" or ""I wish I were dead."" The user expresses feelings of weakness, being pathetic, and hopelessness about their social situation (""I know it's never gonna happen,"" ""I'm pathetic""), but this is distress about their current life circumstances, not a desire for life to end.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Since no suicidal thoughts are expressed, there are no negated thoughts to identify.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** The post clearly expresses general distress, hopelessness about a specific social situation, and feelings of being weak and pathetic. It discusses significant emotional struggles without a stated desire to die. This fits the definition of Indicator.

Step 1: Thinking Process
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will scan the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to ending one's life.
    *   Method: No specific method (e.g., pills, rope, weapon) is mentioned.
    *   Timing: No specific time (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"") is mentioned.
    *   Location: No specific location (e.g., ""a bridge,"" ""at home"") is mentioned.
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions (e.g., ""writing a note,"" ""saying goodbye"") are mentioned.
    *   Conclusion: The post does not contain elements of a plan, so it is not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for phrases expressing a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post states: ""I just want to not exist."" This is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to no longer be alive.
    *   Conclusion: An active suicidal desire is present.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The phrase ""I just want to not exist"" is a clear statement of desire, not a negated or intrusive thought. There is no ""but I don't actually want to"" or similar rejection.
    *   Conclusion: The thoughts are not negated, so it is not Indicator based on this rule.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not reached because an active suicidal desire (Ideation) was identified.

Step 2: Category Definitions Review
*   **Attempt:** No past act of self-harm or suicide attempt is described.
*   **Behavior:** No component of planning (method, timing, location, preparation) is present.
*   **Ideation:** The post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive (""I just want to not exist"") but does not include any concrete plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.
*   **Indicator:** The post goes beyond general distress and explicitly states a desire to not exist, and these thoughts are not negated.

Step 3: Hierarchy Rule
The highest risk category identified is Ideation.

Final decision is Ideation.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states, ""i just want to put a bullet right through it."" This explicitly mentions a method (bullet) and a target (brain), which constitutes a component of a plan.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains multiple clear expressions of a desire to die or end one's life: ""I just want to end it,"" ""i don't want to be here anymore,"" ""i just want to die"" (repeatedly), ""i hate being alive"" (repeatedly).
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting these suicidal thoughts; they are expressing them as their current desire.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk categories are present.
5.  **Hierarchy Rule:** Since the post expresses active suicidal desire (Ideation) and includes a component of planning (a specific method: ""put a bullet right through it""), it falls into the Behavior category. There is no mention of a past attempt.

The user's post needs to be classified based on the provided suicide risk hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It mentions ""i'm on suicide watch,"" which indicates current monitoring, not a past attempt by the user. So, it's not Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   The post states: ""i could take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep"". This mentions a method (""pills"") and timing (""while everyones asleep"").
    *   However, this statement is immediately followed by a strong negation: ""but honestly i'm just too scared. i don't want to die in pain. i don't want to make my mother sad.""
    *   The definition of Behavior requires ""suicidal ideation and a component of planning."" While a method and timing are *considered*, the explicit statement of being ""too scared"" and not wanting to act on it means this is a *hypothetical* consideration, not a concrete plan the user intends to execute. The user is expressing barriers to action, not a firm intention. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):**
    *   The post contains strong expressions of a desire to die or not be alive: ""i really wasn't made for life,"" ""it would be better if i was dead,"" ""i can't keep doing this it's too much,"" ""god i wish i could just fucking end it.""
    *   These phrases clearly indicate an active, personal desire to end their life.

4.  **Check for Indicator (Negated Thoughts/General Distress):**
    *   The ""Crucial Rule"" for Indicator includes posts where the user ""mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" The user *does* state they don't want to act on the *specific hypothetical plan* due to fear.
    *   However, the main definition of Indicator states it ""lacks a personal, active desire to die."" This post *does* have a clear, active desire to die (""i wish i could just fucking end it"", ""it would be better if i was dead"").
    *   The negation in this post (""too scared to act"") is about the *execution* of a specific hypothetical method, not a rejection of the underlying desire to die or the idea of suicide itself. Given the strong, active desire to die, it cannot be classified as Indicator.

**Conclusion:**
The post expresses a clear, active desire to die (Ideation). While it considers a method and timing, the user explicitly states they are too scared to act on it, meaning it's not a concrete plan. The strong, active desire to die prevents it from being an Indicator. Therefore, the highest risk category present is Ideation.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

1.  **Analyze the post for the author's risk:** The instructions state, ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post.""
2.  **Check for Attempt:** The author explicitly states, ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" They also mention, ""to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets).""
3.  **Apply Hierarchy Rule:** The ""Attempt"" category definition includes: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt."" The hierarchy rule also states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Even though the author states they are ""in a good place now"" and haven't had suicidal ideation in months, the explicit mention of a past serious attempt by the author themselves is sufficient to classify it as 'attempt' according to the provided rules and hierarchy.
4.  **Conclusion:** The presence of a described past suicide attempt by the author of the post classifies it as 'attempt', which is the highest risk category.

The user post describes a struggle with mental health and the start of therapy. I need to classify the suicide risk based on the provided hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan)**: The post mentions ""kermit sewer slide thoughts"" and that ""it's tempting a lot of the time."" While this indicates suicidal thoughts, it does *not* include any specific plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). Therefore, it's not 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)**:
    *   The phrase ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" is a clear euphemism for suicidal thoughts.
    *   The crucial part is ""And it's tempting a lot of the time."" This indicates more than just a fleeting or unwanted thought. The user acknowledges these thoughts are present and that there is a strong pull or desire to act on them. This ""tempting"" nature signifies an active suicidal desire, even if not explicitly stated as ""I want to die."" It expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)**: The user does *not* negate or reject these thoughts. Instead, they state they are ""tempting,"" which implies a pull towards them rather than a rejection. If they had said ""my brain tells me to, but I don't want to,"" it would be an 'indicator'. But ""it's tempting a lot of the time"" points to an active desire.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear desire or active consideration of suicide (""kermit sewer slide thoughts"" that are ""tempting a lot of the time"") but lacks any concrete plan. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The user explicitly states, ""I want to kill myself so badly."" This confirms active suicidal ideation. The post then goes on to say, ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me."" This describes a specific method (""jump in front of a train"") and a desired outcome, which constitutes a plan. The user also asks, ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"" and mentions being a ""coward"" regarding ""end of life stuff,"" indicating a desire to act but facing internal barriers, not a lack of a plan or desire.
2.  Since a clear plan (method) is present alongside active suicidal ideation, the post falls into the 'Behavior' category.
3.  No past attempt is described, so it's not 'Attempt'.
4.  The presence of a plan elevates it beyond 'Ideation'.
5.  The thoughts are not negated; the user expresses a strong desire to die and a specific method, so it's not 'Indicator'.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I want to kill myself"" and ""everyone would be better off with me dead,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly says ""I want to kill myself"" and ""everyone would be better off with me dead."" These are direct and active expressions of a desire to die or end one's life. This fits the definition of Ideation.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a direct desire to die, not rejecting or negating intrusive thoughts.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as active suicidal desire was identified.

The user is expressing general distress (""confinement mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed and feeling more alone"").
The post states, ""i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it.""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The user explicitly states ""but i didnt do it,"" meaning no physical action was taken. This is not a past act of self-harm or an aborted attempt. So, not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The user mentions a method (""slitting my wrists"") but immediately negates any action or current plan by saying ""but i didnt do it."" There is no current intention, timing, location, or preparation mentioned. So, not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** While ""i thought about slitting my wrists today"" indicates suicidal thoughts, the crucial phrase ""but i didnt do it"" signifies that the user did not act on this thought and implies a rejection of it or an unwillingness to act. The post does not express an active desire to die or to end one's life. So, not 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The statement ""i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it"" perfectly fits the definition of 'Indicator' where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post mentions ""the suicidal feelings are coming back"" but does not include any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""the suicidal feelings are coming back"" indicates the *presence* of suicidal thoughts or urges. However, it does not explicitly state a direct, active desire to die, such as ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" It describes a return of a *type* of feeling rather than a current, active intent or desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The post doesn't explicitly negate the thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't actually want to""). However, it also doesn't express an active desire. The primary focus of the post is the dental pain and seeking advice, with the suicidal feelings mentioned as a consequence of the distress.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since there is no plan, no past attempt, and no explicit, active desire to die expressed, the post falls into the ""Indicator"" category. The user is expressing general distress, hopelessness related to their dental issues, and mentions the return of ""suicidal feelings,"" which points to mental health struggles and a thematic discussion of suicide without a stated desire to act. This aligns with the ""Indicator"" definition: ""The post shows general distress, hopelessness, or discusses suicide thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die."" The phrase ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" indicates distress and a return of these thoughts, but not a present, active desire to die.

I know this is not the right subreddit to post this stuff but in fact i'm someone who wants to die and that is one of the reasons i'm not within the rules for posting to the correct subs. If you want more information and are interested in helping, I can explain it better in the chat.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will examine the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to suicide. The post states, ""in fact i'm someone who wants to die,"" but it does not include any details about *how*, *when*, or *where* this desire might be acted upon, nor any preparatory steps. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2. **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for phrases indicating a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life. The user explicitly states, ""in fact i'm someone who wants to die."" This is a clear and direct expression of active suicidal desire.

3. **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. The statement ""i'm someone who wants to die"" is a direct assertion of desire, not a rejection or negation of an intrusive thought. Thus, it does not fit the criteria for an Indicator based on negated thoughts.

4. **Default to Indicator:** Since active suicidal desire (Ideation) was identified, this step is not reached.

**Conclusion:** The post clearly expresses an active desire to die (""i'm someone who wants to die"") but lacks any component of a plan. This aligns directly with the definition of Ideation.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It talks about future actions (""I'm leaving soon"").
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** The user explicitly states ""I'm leaving soon,"" ""My minds made up,"" and asks for help with ""goodbye letters,"" which clearly indicates a desire to end their life.
    *   **Plan Component (Preparation):** The user is asking ""how to write good suicide notes"" and ""need help on the goodbye letters."" This is a direct preparatory action for suicide.
    *   Since both active suicidal desire and a preparatory action (writing suicide notes) are present, the post falls into the Behavior category.
3.  **Check for Ideation/Indicator:** These are lower risk categories. Since Behavior has been identified, I do not need to check for these.
4.  **Hierarchy Rule:** Behavior is the highest risk category present.

I just hoped I could get some comfort if there was any left with my psych before I end thing v v soon. save some flowers for me please? I like lavender",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and apply the hierarchy rules.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: The post explicitly states, ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it (doubt ill make it that long)."" This is a very specific timing for a suicidal act, which constitutes a plan. It also says ""before I end thing v v soon"" and ""save some flowers for me please?"", which implies preparation/farewell. So, elements of Behavior are present.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The post clearly expresses a desire to die: ""enough is enough,"" ""I'm fucking done,"" ""before I end thing v v soon."" This goes beyond general sadness and indicates active suicidal desire. So, elements of Ideation are present.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The post does *not* negate suicidal thoughts. While it mentions ""only reason I didn't die last night was bc I actually wanna live if I could get the help I need right now,"" this is immediately followed by a strong statement that such help is impossible to obtain due to systemic issues and past trauma, leading back to the clear intent to die. This is not an intrusive thought that the user rejects.

4.  **Check for Attempt**: The post states, ""It's been 10 yrs of the worst of this hell, 8 yrs of constant attempts but obv I wasn't trying hard enough."" This is a direct and explicit mention of past suicide attempts (""constant attempts"").

**Hierarchy Rule Application**: The post contains elements of Attempt (past attempts), Behavior (specific suicide date/timing, preparatory statements), and Ideation (clear desire to die). According to the hierarchy, ""Attempt"" is the most severe category. The rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Since the post clearly describes ""constant attempts"" in the past and also contains current plans and ideation, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

47,"Pointlessness. I know someone's gonna hit me with ""well if everything's pointless, then it doesn't matter if nothing matters"". Which doesn't make things better. It doesn't make me want to go rogue and have fun with life because I've let everything go, and come what may until in my grave I lay. No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey. I don't want to look on the bright-side, to have confidence or assertiveness. I am bad at both those things. If I was good at them, I wouldn't want them. That's my point. If we have an option as humans to be any way we want, I vote we be no way at all. I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds. I am so sick of appearances. People care SO MUCH about how other people are. It's sickening. I should start being rude to people, in line with how I feel about us. I know there's a heaven and it distresses me. I want to disappear forever and I know God won't let that happen. I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit. What's difficult is the pain caused to people I care about and who care about me, but I don't really think it'll matter one way or the other. They'll suffer and that will be that, different and worse than had they not suffered, but just another experience at the end of the day.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, phrases like ""I want to disappear forever"", ""until in my grave I lay"", ""I want to be the missing pixel which burned out"" clearly indicate a desire for non-existence or death.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? The post states: ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit."" This is a specific timing for death, a self-imposed deadline. This constitutes a plan element.
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and a component of planning (timing) are present, the classification is 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Not applicable, as 'Behavior' has been identified, which is a higher risk category). The post does contain strong ideation, but the presence of a plan elevates it.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** (Not applicable, as higher risk categories are present). The user does not negate or reject their suicidal thoughts; rather, they express them as a desire and an expectation.

Based on the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is the highest risk category identified.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It discusses potential future actions and difficulties.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** The user explicitly states, ""I'm trying to die."" This is a clear expression of suicidal intent.
    *   **Method:** The user discusses specific methods: ""hanging myself,"" ""taking these pills.""
    *   **Timing:** No specific timing is mentioned.
    *   **Location:** The user mentions ""the shower or the door frame"" in the context of a hanging method, indicating a potential location.
    *   **Preparation:** No explicit preparation is mentioned.
    Since the post expresses active suicidal desire (""I'm trying to die"") and discusses specific methods and potential locations, it contains components of a plan. This elevates the risk to Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** While ""I'm trying to die"" clearly indicates Ideation, the presence of planning elements (methods, locations) means it's a higher risk category.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a desire to die, not rejecting unwanted thoughts.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher categories fit.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of active suicidal desire combined with a discussion of specific methods and potential locations for carrying out the act classifies this as Behavior.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"". There is no mention of method, timing, location, or preparation. Thus, it is not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains the phrase ""I want to die"". This is a direct expression of active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Immediately following ""I want to die"", the user states, ""but I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up."" This phrase negates the intent to act on the suicidal desire. The ""Crucial Rule"" for Indicator states that this category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them. The fear of ""messing it up"" acts as a clear barrier and rejection of acting on the suicidal thought. The user is also contemplating seeking help (""thinking about admitting myself?""), which further indicates a lack of immediate intent to act on suicidal thoughts and a desire for safety.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Given the presence of suicidal thoughts (""I want to die"") combined with a clear negation of intent to act on those thoughts (""but I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up""), the post fits the criteria for Indicator. The user is expressing distress and suicidal ideation, but also a lack of active intent to follow through.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post states ""every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all."" This describes a recurring contemplation and a preparatory action (counting pills) and regret for *not* having acted, but it does not describe a *past completed or aborted act* of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" and ""why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?"" clearly indicate a desire to end their life or regret not having done so.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
        *   **Method:** ""pills"" is explicitly mentioned as the means.
        *   **Preparation:** ""every night i count my pills"" is a direct and recurring preparatory action involving the method. This action demonstrates engagement with the means of suicide.
    *   Because there is clear suicidal ideation combined with a specific method and a recurring preparatory action, this fits the ""Behavior"" category.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: While there is active suicidal desire, the presence of a plan component (method + preparation) elevates it beyond just Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user is expressing regret for *not* acting on the thoughts, not negating or rejecting the thoughts themselves. So, it's not an Indicator.

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation and a concrete preparatory action involving a specific method. This classifies it as Behavior according to the hierarchy.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process:

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to ending one's life.
    *   The post states: ""The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately. Idk why but in the past few months my thoughts have been in a major downward spiral. Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me. I've been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I don't want to end up in the psych ward again. I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.""
    *   There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note).
    *   Therefore, this post does not qualify as Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post mentions ""thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately"" and ""major downward spiral"" and ""struggle for me"" and ""don't know what to do."" It also mentions a fear of ending up ""in the psych ward again,"" indicating significant mental distress and a history of mental health issues.
    *   However, the post *does not* explicitly state a desire to die, such as ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I want to end it all,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" While the ""thoughts"" are a ""downward spiral"" and ""unbearably strong,"" the *content* of these thoughts is not specified as suicidal ideation.
    *   Therefore, this post does not meet the criteria for Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The post does not explicitly mention suicidal thoughts that are then rejected (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't want to""). It describes general strong, spiraling thoughts, but doesn't specify them as suicidal and then negate them.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly conveys general distress (""unbearably strong thoughts,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""struggle for me,"" ""don't know what to do""). It also highlights mental health struggles and a fear of re-hospitalization (""psych ward again""). It expresses hopelessness and a feeling of being overwhelmed. Crucially, it lacks an explicit statement of a desire to die or a plan.
    *   This perfectly aligns with the definition of Indicator.

**Hierarchy Rule Check:**
*   No Attempt is present.
*   No Behavior is present.
*   No Ideation is present.
*   The post clearly fits the criteria for Indicator.

Final decision is Indicator.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior):** The post expresses a desire to die (""lost all will to live,"" ""want to die"") but does not include any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post contains clear expressions of a desire to not be alive or to die: ""I don't wanna do this anymore,"" ""I've lost all will to live,"" and ""want to die."" These are active expressions of suicidal desire.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is expressing these thoughts as their own desire, not as intrusive thoughts they are rejecting. The phrase ""I know it sounds so stupid to want to die"" is a self-judgment about the *reason* for the thoughts, not a rejection of the thoughts themselves. Therefore, it is not Indicator based on negated thoughts.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die, but without any concrete plan. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the established hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It discusses a potential future event (""my death,"" ""when I off myself""). So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   **Method:** The phrase ""off myself"" implies a method, but it's generic and doesn't specify *how* (e.g., pills, rope, specific weapon). It's not a concrete method.
    *   **Timing:** ""decades to come"" is a statement about *not* being able to live for a long time, not a specific timing for the act itself (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""). There is no specified time for the act.
    *   **Location:** No location is mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions are mentioned.
    Since there is no concrete plan component (method, timing, location, or preparation) as defined, it does not fit the 'Behavior' category.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   ""I don't want to live anymore"" - This is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to not be alive.
    *   ""i can't keep living with depression"" - Reinforces the desire to end their current state.
    *   ""what kind of impact will my death have on my mother?"" - This indicates contemplation of their own death.
    *   ""when i off myself"" - This explicitly refers to the act of suicide.
    *   ""i can't continue to live for decades to come"" - This expresses an inability to continue living.
    All these phrases clearly indicate an active desire to die or not be alive.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing their own feelings and intentions, not intrusive thoughts that they are rejecting. The concern for the mother is a reason for hesitation, but it does not negate the underlying suicidal desire.

Based on this analysis, the post clearly expresses an active suicidal desire without a concrete plan. Therefore, it falls into the 'Ideation' category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post states, ""i know that i'm going to end up getting fed up of all this bullshit and just killing myself because what's the point in not"". This expresses a clear intention/expectation of suicide. Now, I need to check for a *plan*:
    *   **Method:** No specific method is mentioned (e.g., pills, rope).
    *   **Timing:** No specific timing is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""). ""Going to end up getting fed up"" implies a future, but it's not a concrete time.
    *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions are mentioned.
    Since no concrete planning element is present, it is not ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The post explicitly states, ""i know that i'm going to end up...just killing myself"". This is a direct and active expression of a desire or expectation to end one's life. It is not merely general distress or hopelessness.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is *not* expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want. The phrase ""because what's the point in not"" reinforces the idea, indicating acceptance of this future outcome, not rejection. Therefore, it's not ""Indicator"" based on negated thoughts.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since ""Ideation"" is clearly present, it does not default to ""Indicator"" for general distress.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire/expectation to die (""just killing myself"") but lacks any concrete planning elements. This aligns perfectly with the definition of ""Ideation.""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt (""I put a belt around my neck..."" or similar). It expresses current distress and a desire to end life, but no past action.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post states, ""There has to be a non painful way to do this."" This indicates an active search or contemplation of a *method* for suicide. While a specific method isn't named, the user is clearly thinking about *how* to die, which falls under the ""method"" component of a plan. This, combined with the explicit desire ""I cant live anymore,"" points to Behavior. The user is not just wishing to die, but actively considering the means.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I cant live anymore""). However, since a component of planning (contemplation of method) is present, it moves beyond Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user does not negate their suicidal thoughts. They are expressed as a genuine desire.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This category is not applicable as there is clear ideation and a component of planning.

Based on the presence of suicidal ideation (""I cant live anymore"") and the contemplation of a method (""There has to be a non painful way to do this""), the classification is Behavior.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It talks about future actions.
2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""i want to do it,"" ""I want to kill myself.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Method:** ""with drugs"" - Yes, a specific method is mentioned.
        *   **Timing:** ""next week"" - Yes, a specific timeframe is mentioned.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I just have to write a suicide note for my family"" - Yes, a preparatory action is mentioned.
    Since there is clear suicidal ideation and multiple elements of a plan (method, timing, preparation), the post fits the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** While ideation is present, the presence of a plan elevates it to Behavior.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** This is clearly beyond general distress or negated thoughts.

Based on the hierarchy, ""Behavior"" is the highest applicable risk level.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. It mentions being ""ready to get this over with soon"" but this is a future or current state, not a past action.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post expresses a clear desire to end things (""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue.""). It also includes a timeframe: ""soon."" While ""soon"" is vague, the definition of Behavior states that a plan can include a ""specific timeframe"" and that ""the presence of any of these, even if vague, elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior."" The examples provided for Behavior, such as ""tonight"" or ""at 21,"" are specific timeframes. ""Soon"" indicates an anticipated action in the near future, which fits the ""timing"" component of a plan, even if vague. The phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with"" combined with ""soon"" indicates an active readiness for an action to take place within a timeframe. This elevates it beyond mere ideation.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** While the post clearly expresses a desire to die, the presence of a timeframe (""soon"") moves it beyond Ideation according to the hierarchy.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not negating their suicidal thoughts or expressing them as unwanted/intrusive. They are expressing a personal readiness to act. Therefore, it is not an Indicator.

Based on the hierarchy and definitions, the presence of suicidal ideation (""I'm ready to get this over with"") combined with a timeframe (""soon"") qualifies this post as Behavior.

I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user has posted about a past action.
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post describes an action that has already occurred, not a future plan.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The user states, ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over."" This indicates a desire to end suffering, but explicitly negates the desire to die. However, the primary information is a past action.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** While the user negates the desire to die, the core of the post is a past action.
4.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I finally went through. I have overdosed. I took 500mg Zoloft..."" This describes a past act of self-harm, an overdose. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts... and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting."" An overdose, even if stated to be for punishment rather than death, is a past act of self-harm and falls under this category.
5.  **Hierarchy Rule:** ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post describes a past attempt, which is the highest risk category.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It refers to a future action.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, phrases like ""I'm doing it,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" ""ready to go,"" and ""I'm ready"" clearly express suicidal intent.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Timing:** ""in the near future"" is a specified timeframe, even if not extremely precise. This fulfills the ""timing"" component of a plan.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend and now I think I'm ready to go"" strongly suggests a preparatory action, possibly saying goodbye or finding peace before the act.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and elements of timing and preparation, this post falls into the Behavior category.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is superseded because a plan component was identified, elevating it to Behavior.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Not applicable, as the user is expressing active intent, not rejected thoughts.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable.

Based on the presence of clear suicidal ideation and components of a plan (timing and preparation), the highest risk category is Behavior.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states ""when my old high school found out i was suicidal"". This refers to a past state of being suicidal, not a past *act* or *attempt* of self-harm or suicide. Therefore, it is not an Attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not express any current suicidal thoughts *and* a plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). The reference to ""i was suicidal"" is a past event (""4 yrs ago""). Therefore, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post does not express a *current* desire to no longer be alive or to die. It reflects on a past period (""4 yrs ago"") when the user *was* suicidal and the inadequate response from school. There is no phrasing like ""I want to die now,"" ""I wish I were dead now,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" Therefore, it is not Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** While the post mentions ""i was suicidal,"" it's a historical statement, not a current intrusive thought that is being negated.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since it's not an Attempt, Behavior, or current Ideation, the post falls into the Indicator category. It discusses suicide thematically by reflecting on a past period of being suicidal and the associated distress, but it lacks a personal, active *current* desire to die or a plan. It's a reflection on past mental health struggles and a negative experience.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post does not describe any past actions of self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   Therefore, it is not ""Attempt"".

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post asks ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and states ""Might as well just die,"" which are expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note).
    *   Therefore, it is not ""Behavior"".

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die, but without a concrete plan?
    *   The phrases ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ""Might as well just die"" are direct expressions of a desire or consideration to die.
    *   The user also expresses profound hopelessness (""nothing will make me happier. Not even love... Nothing will."").
    *   These are not presented as intrusive thoughts that the user rejects. The user is actively contemplating and expressing the desire to die.
    *   This fits the definition of ""Ideation.""

4.  **Check for Indicator:** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want, or is it general distress without a stated desire to die?
    *   The thoughts are not clearly rejected or stated as unwanted intrusive thoughts. The phrases ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ""Might as well just die"" convey a genuine contemplation or inclination towards suicide, not a rejection of the thought.
    *   Since a clear desire to die is expressed, it is more severe than ""Indicator.""

Based on the hierarchy, the post clearly expresses a desire to die without a plan, fitting the ""Ideation"" category.

63,i should die.

I am just rubbish sucking at everything. I hate my family I have no friends I am so sensitive. I don't think it makes any sense that they have to raise me. tho I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything. I still hate that why everyone was born in a rich family at least not that poor like me. I just hate them that if u are not qualified to give at least average life to ur children then why u still give birth to them and suffer from u? fuck,2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user's post needs to be classified based on the suicide risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post states, ""tho I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything."" This indicates a past *decision* and *preparation*, but it does not describe a past *act* of self-harm or a suicide attempt (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I cut myself,"" ""I put a belt around my neck""). Therefore, it does not qualify as an ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior**: The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""i should die,"" ""made up my mind to kill myself""). Crucially, it also mentions a component of planning: ""I have prepared everything."" ""Preparation"" is explicitly listed as an element that elevates a post to the ""Behavior"" category. Since there is active suicidal ideation combined with a preparatory act, this fits the definition of ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)**: While ""i should die"" and ""made up my mind to kill myself"" are clear expressions of suicidal ideation, the presence of ""prepared everything"" moves it beyond just ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)**: The user is not rejecting or negating their suicidal thoughts; they are affirming them and stating preparation.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of both suicidal ideation and a preparatory act places this post in the ""Behavior"" category, as it is a higher risk than ""Ideation"" and does not meet the criteria for ""Attempt.""

I hope they enjoy my stuff, cuz they never seemed to enjoy my company.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post describes future actions and plans, not a past attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I would want to vanish without a trace,"" ""Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body."" This clearly indicates a desire to die.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Method:** ""a pistol"" - Yes, a specific method is mentioned.
        *   **Timing:** ""When that happens [roommates ask me to move out]"" - This is a conditional timing, but it's a specific trigger for the act.
        *   **Location:** ""a secluded spot where no one will find my body"" - Yes, a specific type of location is described.
        *   **Preparation:** ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them, pick a direction, and start walking. No phone or car to trace me, just cash and a pair of shoes."" - Yes, detailed preparatory actions are outlined.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and multiple elements of a plan (method, location, preparation, and conditional timing), the post falls into the 'behavior' category.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** While active suicidal desire is present, the presence of a plan elevates it beyond 'ideation'.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The thoughts are not negated; they are expressed as a clear intention and plan.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of a plan with suicidal ideation classifies this as 'behavior'.

The user post states, ""I want to die."" This is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to no longer be alive.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""I want to die,"" ""I give up now"") but does not include any specific plan elements (method, timing, location, or preparation). There's no mention of how, when, or where the act might occur, nor any preparatory actions.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I give up now""). Since there is no plan, this fits the definition of Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is not negating or rejecting the suicidal thoughts; rather, they are actively expressing them as their own desire. Therefore, it is not an Indicator.

Based on the hierarchy, since there is a clear expression of suicidal desire without a plan, the classification is Ideation.

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post based on the given hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes past self-harm: ""I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face"". According to the definition, ""non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting"" falls under the 'Attempt' category. The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" This post contains both past self-harm and current plans/ideation.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Even if 'Attempt' wasn't present, I would check for 'Behavior'. The user expresses clear suicidal ideation (""I don't want the existance ive got"", ""I feel im on the edge"") and includes elements of a plan:
    *   **Location:** ""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it""
    *   **Preparation:** ""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police.""
    This would classify it as 'Behavior' if 'Attempt' wasn't present.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive (""I don't want the existance ive got"").

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user does not negate their suicidal thoughts; rather, they express a desire for a ""long term fix"" to prevent the recurrence of these feelings, but the current desire to not exist is active.

Since the post explicitly describes past self-harm, which is categorized as 'Attempt' in this framework, and also contains current ideation and planning, the highest risk category is 'Attempt' based on the hierarchy rule.

The user is expressing significant distress over not being allowed to drive after getting their license.
1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post contains clear suicidal ideation (""I wanna off myself,"" ""I don't even wanna live anymore""). However, it does *not* mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** Yes, the post explicitly states ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore."" These are direct expressions of a desire to die or not be alive.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is expressing their own desire to die, not intrusive thoughts they are rejecting. The statements are active and personal.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire to die without any planning component. This fits the definition of Ideation.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It refers to a future action (""tonight's the night"").
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan + Suicidal Thoughts):**
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** The phrase ""Anyway tonight's the night I guess"" and ""No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone"" clearly express a desire to end one's life.
    *   **Plan element:** ""tonight's the night I guess"" specifies a *timing* for the act. This constitutes a component of a plan.
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and a timing element of a plan are present, the post falls under the Behavior category.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** While there is clear ideation, the presence of a plan element (timing) elevates it beyond just ideation.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The post expresses active suicidal desire and a plan, so it is not an indicator.

Based on the hierarchy, ""Behavior"" is the highest risk level present.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post asks a hypothetical question about combining substances and a method (""oxy and cutting an artery"") to lessen pain *when* cutting an artery. It does not describe a past act of self-harm or a completed/aborted suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts/desire? Yes, the user is asking about specific methods (""oxy and cutting an artery"") to reduce pain for an implied suicidal act. This clearly indicates a desire to end their life.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
        *   **Method:** ""oxy"" and ""cutting an artery"" are explicitly mentioned as a combination of methods.
        *   **Preparation:** The question itself, ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"", is a form of research or inquiry into the practical execution of the act, specifically related to pain management during the act. This constitutes a preparatory action or detailed planning.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation combined with specific methods and a question about preparation/execution, this fits the definition of Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is skipped because the post already qualifies for Behavior, which is a higher risk level.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument.

What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is asking for a suicide risk classification of their social media post. I need to apply the provided hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt by the user. It mentions a friend's prediction about the user *killing themselves*, but not an action by the user.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not express suicidal thoughts *by the user* and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation). The user states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness"" and is seeking advice on how to handle a friend's hurtful words, not how to enact a plan.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post does not explicitly express a desire by the user to no longer be alive or to die. The user is recounting a friend's brutal comment about the user's potential suicide and how it has affected them. The user's own statements (""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" ""I could have tried to reassure her"" regarding her fear of the user committing suicide) indicate a lack of active suicidal desire. The phrase ""If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said 'I'm scared you're going to commit suicide' and I could have tried to reassure her"" further reinforces that the user is not expressing their own desire to die, but rather reacting to the friend's perception.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** While the post mentions ""suicide"" in the context of the friend's comment, the user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they then negate (like ""my brain tells me X but I don't want to""). Instead, the user is actively fighting their mental illness and is hurt by the friend's words, which imply a lack of faith in their fight. The distress is about the friend's comment and its impact, not about the user's own suicidal urges.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** The post expresses general distress, hurt, and mental health struggles (""BPD and CPTSD,"" ""fight my mental illness""). It discusses suicide thematically because of the friend's comment, but it lacks a personal, active desire to die from the user. The user is asking for advice on how to handle a difficult interpersonal situation and their feelings about it. This fits the definition of Indicator.

The user is asking for a suicide risk classification for the provided post. I need to follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes an *imminent* action (""im about to cut the screen and jump out""), not a past act of self-harm or a completed/aborted suicide attempt. So, it's not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""jump out"" clearly indicates a desire to end one's life.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Method:** ""jump out"" (implied act of suicide).
        *   **Timing:** ""right now,"" ""im about to."" This indicates immediacy.
        *   **Location:** ""at my window right now."" This is a specific location for the act.
        *   **Preparation:** ""with scissors, i feel like im about to cut the screen."" This describes a preparatory action to facilitate the jump.
    *   Since suicidal thoughts and multiple elements of a plan (location, timing, preparation) are present, the category is **Behavior**.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While ideation (""jump out"") is present, the presence of a plan elevates it to Behavior.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** This is not an indicator because there is clear active suicidal desire and planning, not just general distress or negated thoughts.

Based on the hierarchy, ""Behavior"" is the highest applicable risk level.
</thinking>
Final Classification: behavior",behavior,True
72,i'm gonna overdose on iron pills. i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it. i'm sorry,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post states ""i'm gonna overdose,"" which indicates a future intention, not a past completed or aborted act. Therefore, it is not ""Attempt.""
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post explicitly states ""i'm gonna overdose on iron pills."" This includes a clear method (""iron pills"") and a clear intent to act (""i'm gonna overdose""). The phrase ""i don't wanna deal with it"" further reinforces the suicidal desire. Since there is both suicidal ideation and a concrete method, this fits the definition of ""Behavior.""
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post clearly expresses a desire to end suffering and implies a desire to die (""i'm gonna overdose... i don't wanna deal with it""). This would qualify for Ideation, but the presence of a plan elevates it.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a direct intention, not unwanted or rejected thoughts.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher categories fit.

Based on the hierarchy, ""Behavior"" is the highest applicable risk level because it includes both suicidal ideation and a specific method (part of a plan).

73,"im going to kill myself one day. am in high school and just got deferred from my dream school. i have waited and endured for so long cuz i thought i would escape in college. my life, i dont even know what that is. life. i dont even know since it isnt even mine. i hate it! why do MY parents have to be absuive, but rich enough to control me financially so that i dont run away? i dont have money, a license, friends, nothing and i feel like a failure who might as well die. i seriously am that person everyone makes fun of at school. even on fucking zoom, when i was stuttering the entire time during an online presentation when everyone, my crush &amp; the closest thing i have to a friend in that class, everyone! even my teacher! was making fun of me. i hate them and my parents and i just want to disappear, like i dont even want their pity, or want them to ever know they got to me, but i just want to run away to a forest and fucking die. the only thing thats stopping is that there is still a chance to get in to a college somewhere far, far away with a full scholarship and never see anyone from my past life again. but the chances of that are so slim so i dont even know.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post describes future intentions (""im going to kill myself one day"") and current distress, but no past actions of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   ""im going to kill myself one day."" - ""one day"" is vague timing, not a specific plan.
    *   ""i just want to run away to a forest and fucking die."" - ""a forest"" is a very general location, not a concrete, actionable plan. It's more of a fantasy of escape and death rather than a prepared action.
    *   Crucially, the post states: ""the only thing thats stopping is that there is still a chance to get in to a college somewhere far, far away with a full scholarship and never see anyone from my past life again."" This indicates a strong deterrent and a lack of immediate, concrete planning. While there's a desire to die, there isn't a *plan* in the sense of method, specific timing, or preparation. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   ""im going to kill myself one day."" - Yes, a direct statement of future suicidal intent.
    *   ""i feel like a failure who might as well die."" - Yes, expresses a desire to die.
    *   ""i just want to run away to a forest and fucking die."" - Yes, clearly expresses a desire to die.
    *   These phrases clearly indicate an active desire to not be alive or to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing their own genuine desire to die, not intrusive thoughts that they are rejecting. The ""stopping"" factor is a hope for a better future, not a negation of the suicidal thoughts themselves. Therefore, it's not 'indicator' based on negated thoughts.

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear, active suicidal desire (""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to kill myself one day"") but lacks a concrete plan (method, specific timing, specific location, or preparation). The mention of ""a forest"" is too vague to be considered a concrete plan, and the stated ""stopping"" factor further indicates a lack of immediate, actionable planning. Thus, it fits the definition of 'ideation'.

74,"Hoping to be murdered. I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people.

I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die. I'm so hyperaware of how I'm clearly defective and unfit to be alive. It's like I have a terminal illness no one recognizes. I just have to pray for some random person to murder me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the hierarchical classification process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a desire for death (""hoping to be murdered,"" ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me"") but does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. The user explicitly states, ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself."" Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of *personal* plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   **Method:** The method mentioned is ""being murdered"" by someone else, not a personal method of self-harm. The user states they lack the ""heart/bravery to kill myself.""
    *   **Timing:** No specific timing for a *personal* act of suicide. ""Every night"" refers to walking through sketchy areas, hoping for an external event.
    *   **Location:** ""Sketchy areas every night"" is where they hope to be murdered, not a location for a *personal* suicide plan.
    *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions for a *personal* suicide.
    Since the ""plan"" is entirely passive and relies on an external actor (being murdered) rather than the individual's own agency, and the user explicitly states they lack the ability to act personally, this does not fit the definition of 'Behavior'. The criteria for 'Behavior' require *the user* to include a component of planning for *their own* suicidal act.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   ""Hoping to be murdered.""
    *   ""I hate being alive.""
    *   ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me.""
    *   ""if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people.""
    *   ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered.""
    *   ""to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself.""
    *   ""how much I want to die.""
    *   ""I'm clearly defective and unfit to be alive.""
    *   ""I just have to pray for some random person to murder me.""
    These phrases clearly and repeatedly express a strong, active desire to die and not be alive. The desire is explicit and personal, even if the preferred means of death is external. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is *not* expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. They are expressing a genuine, active desire to die, even if they are unable or unwilling to act on it themselves. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

Based on the hierarchy, since it's not an 'Attempt' or 'Behavior', but clearly expresses an active desire to die, the classification is 'Ideation'.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post uses future-oriented language (""I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave""). It does not describe any past actions.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Plan (Behavior?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** Yes, ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave"", ""I can't take no more.""
    *   **Method:** ""my favorite part is I'll experience it painfully"" suggests a desire for a painful method, but doesn't specify *what* that method is. This alone isn't a concrete method.
    *   **Timing:** ""My day count for life is 8,000 days... 8,000 days and I can't take no more."" This expresses a feeling of having reached a limit, implying an imminent end, but doesn't state a specific time for the act (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""tomorrow"").
    *   **Location:** No mention of a specific location.
    *   **Preparation:** ""See you all on the other side. Take care."" This is a clear farewell, which is explicitly listed as a preparatory action (""saying goodbye"") in the prompt's definition of a plan.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and a preparatory action (saying goodbye), the post fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is skipped because 'Behavior' was identified. If 'Behavior' was not identified, I would check for explicit desire to die without a plan.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is skipped because 'Behavior' was identified. If neither 'Attempt' nor 'Behavior' nor 'Ideation' fit, I would consider 'Indicator'.

Based on the presence of suicidal ideation and a preparatory action (saying goodbye), the highest risk category present is Behavior.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will scan the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to ending one's life.
    *   Method: No specific method mentioned (e.g., pills, rope, weapon).
    *   Timing: No specific time mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
    *   Location: No specific location mentioned (e.g., ""a bridge,"" ""my home"").
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions mentioned (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    *   Since no elements of a plan are present, the post is not classified as Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for phrases expressing a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   ""I just don't wanna be here"" - This is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to not be alive.
    *   ""I don't think I can do it anymore"" - This implies giving up on life or the struggle to live.
    *   ""im starting to want to wave the white flag"" - This is a strong metaphor for giving up on life/struggle.
    *   These phrases collectively indicate an active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The user is expressing their own personal desire to not be here and to give up, not describing intrusive thoughts they are rejecting. There is no negation like ""but I don't actually want to.""

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since active suicidal desire (Ideation) was identified, the classification will not default to Indicator.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt or self-harm described.
*   **Behavior:** No plan identified.
*   **Ideation:** Active suicidal desire is clearly present without a plan.
*   **Indicator:** Not applicable as active suicidal desire is present.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire to no longer be alive without any concrete plan, fitting the definition of Ideation.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It focuses on current feelings and future intent.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I have to kill myself,"" ""Death is my only option right now,"" ""I have to do this""). However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly and repeatedly expresses a strong desire to die and end their life (""I have to kill myself,"" ""Death is my only option right now,"" ""I have to do this,"" ""It'd be worse staying alive""). This goes beyond general distress and indicates a clear, active suicidal desire.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want. They are expressing a direct and active intent.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as the post clearly fits the Ideation category.

The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life.

I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a wish to ""donate"" their life. While this implies not wanting to live, it does not describe a concrete method, timing, location, or preparatory action for *ending their own life*. The concept is hypothetical and altruistic, not a suicide plan. Therefore, it's not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states, ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" This is a clear and direct expression of a desire to no longer be alive. It goes beyond general distress and indicates a personal desire to die or not exist.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The statement ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" is a direct assertion of the user's feelings, not a description of intrusive thoughts they are rejecting. There is no negation present.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since an active suicidal desire was identified in step 2, the classification will not default to Indicator.

**Final Decision:** The post expresses a clear desire not to live (""I don't deserve, nor want to live"") but does not include any concrete plan. This fits the definition of Ideation.

Soda and junk will kill me faster. Hope it all ends soon. Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon""). This immediately puts it at least at the Ideation level.

Next, I need to check for elements of a plan to determine if it's Behavior.
-   **Method:** The user states, ""Soda and junk will kill me faster."" This is a stated, albeit passive, method to achieve death. More significantly, ""I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" Stopping prescribed medication, especially critical ones like blood pressure meds, can be considered a preparatory action or a method to hasten death by neglecting health.
-   **Timing:** ""today"" for stopping meds is a concrete action with a timeframe. ""Hope it all ends soon"" implies a desire for a near-future outcome.
-   **Location:** Not specified.
-   **Preparation:** ""I'm stopping all my meds today."" This is a direct preparatory action, indicating a concrete step being taken towards the expressed desire to die. Quitting therapy also indicates a rejection of support systems.

Since the post contains both active suicidal ideation (""I'm ready to die"") and components of a plan/preparation (stopping all meds today, using junk food/soda as a method), it falls into the **Behavior** category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post: ""I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not mention any method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I just want to disappear"" combined with ""I just want the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain"" expresses a clear desire to no longer exist or to die to escape suffering. This is an active desire to end one's life, even if not explicitly using the word ""die."" It goes beyond general distress.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing these thoughts as unwanted or rejected. They are expressing a personal desire. Therefore, it's not ""Indicator"" based on negation.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since an active suicidal desire (Ideation) is present, I do not default to Indicator.

Based on the definitions, the post expresses a clear desire to no longer be alive or to die (""disappear,"" ""soul to be free from all this pain"") but lacks any concrete plan. This fits the definition of ""Ideation.""

The user post is ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!""
    *   It explicitly states: ""Ps: I just need a plan for suicide"". This is a crucial phrase. While it doesn't *have* a plan yet, the statement ""I just need a plan"" indicates an active search for a method or a preparatory step towards an act. It's not just a passive desire; it's an active statement about moving towards acquiring the means or details for suicide. This falls under the ""preparation"" aspect of a plan, as the user is actively seeking or acknowledging the necessity of a plan. Therefore, this classifies as 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** If it wasn't behavior, would it be ideation? Yes, ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" is a clear expression of suicidal desire. However, the presence of the ""need a plan"" elevates it.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** This is clearly beyond general distress or rejected thoughts.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of the ""need for a plan"" elevates the risk to 'behavior'.

I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user post describes several elements. I need to go through the hierarchy from most severe to least severe.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""I say other things like 'I wish I stayed in the car' (relating to my most recent failed attempt)"". This is a clear, explicit mention of a past suicide attempt. According to the rules, ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post *does* mention a past attempt. Therefore, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Not applicable, as an Attempt is present.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** Not applicable, as an Attempt is present.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The post mentions ""almost uncontrollably saying 'I'm going to kill myself'"" and ""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out."" These elements, if considered in isolation, might lean towards Indicator (due to the ""uncontrollably saying"" suggesting intrusive thoughts) or Ideation (the finger gun action). However, the explicit mention of a ""failed attempt"" overrides these.

Since the post explicitly describes a ""most recent failed attempt,"" the highest risk category is Attempt.

The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** I need to look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to suicidal thoughts.
    *   Method: No specific method (e.g., pills, rope) is mentioned.
    *   Timing: No specific time (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"") is mentioned.
    *   Location: No specific location (e.g., ""a bridge"") is mentioned.
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye) are mentioned.
    Since no elements of a plan are present, the post is not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post states: ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore.""
    *   The post also states: ""Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal.""
    These phrases clearly indicate an active desire to not be alive and suicidal thoughts.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Before finalizing on Ideation, I need to ensure the user is not rejecting these suicidal thoughts.
    *   The user states ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal"" without any negation or rejection (e.g., ""but I don't actually want to""). The desire is presented as current and genuine. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator' based on negated thoughts.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since active suicidal desire (Ideation) is present, it does not default to 'Indicator'.

**Conclusion:** The post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive and suicidal feelings, but it does not include any concrete plan. This perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

I haven't made a single friend, let alone done anything fun. At this point it just feels like I'm just going through the motions. Is this my life now? Spending day after day at home by myself, nobody to talk to, nothing to do other than work. If that's what my life is going to be I don't want it. I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day of this seemingly endless torment.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is expressing significant distress and hopelessness about their current life situation.
1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post contains the phrase ""I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day of this seemingly endless torment.""
    *   **Method:** No specific method is mentioned.
    *   **Timing:** ""now"" is a specific timeframe. This indicates an immediate desire to act, which constitutes a timing component of a plan according to the guidelines (""A plan can be... a specific timeframe"").
    *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions are mentioned.
    Since a specific timeframe (""now"") is present along with suicidal ideation, this qualifies as Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** Yes, ""I'd rather kill myself now"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to die. This is clearly present.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** No, the user is not rejecting these thoughts; they are expressing them as their current preference.

Because the post expresses active suicidal desire (""I'd rather kill myself"") and includes a specific timeframe (""now""), it meets the criteria for Behavior. The presence of a timing component elevates it beyond Ideation.

I'm on a throwaway account so I'll probably never check it again.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to kill myself,"" ""I still have the urge to just blow my brains out""). This immediately places it above Indicator.

Next, I check for a plan. The post mentions a specific method: ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger."" Even though the user states they are scared or cannot bring themselves to do it, the presence of a specific method, combined with active suicidal desire, elevates the risk to Behavior. The user is not negating the *desire* to die, but rather expressing an *inability* to act on it due to fear or other inhibitors. This is distinct from ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to.""

Since there is no description of a past attempt, ""Attempt"" is not applicable.
Since there is a method mentioned in conjunction with the ideation, ""Behavior"" is the correct classification over ""Ideation"".

The user post is: ""kill me. i'll dm the address, please come here and murder me i beg of you end my horrible life""

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It is a present plea.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""kill me,"" ""end my horrible life"" clearly show a desire to die.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Method:** The user is asking someone to ""murder me,"" which is a specific method for ending their life, albeit by another's hand.
        *   **Timing:** Not explicitly mentioned.
        *   **Location:** ""i'll dm the address, please come here"" explicitly provides a location where the desired act should occur. This is a clear element of a plan.
        *   **Preparation:** ""i'll dm the address, please come here"" is a preparatory action, inviting someone to facilitate the act.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation (""kill me,"" ""end my horrible life"") and elements of a plan (specific location, implied method, and preparatory action of inviting someone), the post fits the criteria for **Behavior**.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** This is present, but the presence of a plan elevates it beyond Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is not negating their thoughts; they are actively expressing a desire and a plan.
5.  **Default to Indicator?** Not applicable, as higher risk categories fit.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of suicidal ideation combined with a specific location and a request for action (which serves as a method/preparation) classifies this as Behavior.

87,"I'm about to get fired, my boss hates me, and I deserve it. I'm 21, and I graduated college in December. My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city. I haven't dated in years (I don't think I'm very attractive tbh, but this doesn't bother me that much). My family is nuts. I feel like I wasn't allowed a normal childhood, and I've spent my whole life trying to avoid being 'trapped,' but every time I make progress, I wind up worse off than before. I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time. I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen. But I don't see a way out, and I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempts. The user states, ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen,"" which explicitly rules out a past attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not mention any specific plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) for ending their life. While there's a feeling of hopelessness, there's no actionable plan.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post contains the phrase ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"", which suggests a passive desire to not be alive. However, this is immediately followed by ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen."" This explicit negation of *deliberate action* prevents it from being classified as active Ideation, as the user is stating they do not intend to act on these thoughts.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The post expresses significant general distress, hopelessness about their career and social life, and mental health struggles (""I feel like I wasn't allowed a normal childhood,"" ""I've spent my whole life trying to avoid being 'trapped,' but every time I make progress, I wind up worse off than before""). Crucially, it mentions a thought that ""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore,"" but then explicitly rejects acting on it (""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen""). This aligns perfectly with the Indicator definition, which includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.

Therefore, the highest risk category present is Indicator due to the general distress, hopelessness, and the presence of a passive suicidal thought that is explicitly negated by the user.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt (e.g., ""I put a belt around my neck,"" ""I took pills""). So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger,"" ""i just want to collapse and let go""). Now I need to check for a plan (method, timing, location, preparation).
    *   Method: No mention of specific tools, substances, or weapons.
    *   Timing: No specific time mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
    *   Location: No specific place mentioned.
    *   Preparation: No mention of writing a note or saying goodbye.
    The phrase ""i just want to collapse and let go"" expresses a desire to end the struggle, but it does not constitute a concrete plan. Therefore, it's not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The post clearly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die.
    *   ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" - This is a direct statement of increasing suicidal ideation.
    *   ""this is too hard, i can't keep getting false hope that i'll actually end up happy."" - Expresses hopelessness about life improving.
    *   ""help me please, i just want to collapse and let go"" - ""Collapse and let go"" in this context signifies a strong desire to give up on life and die. This is an active expression of wanting to end things.
    The post mentions a past attempt to ""power through,"" but the current state described is that the thoughts are ""stronger and stronger"" and they ""just want to collapse and let go,"" indicating a current, active desire, not a rejection of the thoughts.

4.  **Check for Indicator (Negated Thoughts/General Distress):** The post goes beyond general distress and explicitly states ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" and ""i just want to collapse and let go,"" which are direct expressions of a desire to die or end life, not just general sadness or negated thoughts.

Based on the analysis, the post contains clear active suicidal desire (""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger,"" ""i just want to collapse and let go"") but no concrete plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a *future* plan (""I am planning to kill myself tonight""), not a past act of self-harm or an attempt. So, it's not ""Attempt.""
2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I am planning to kill myself tonight.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Timing:** ""tonight"" is explicitly stated.
        *   **Preparation:** ""Rest In Peace ya'll. ✌️"" functions as a farewell, indicating preparation.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and elements of a plan (timing and preparatory goodbye), this post falls under ""Behavior.""
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is skipped because ""Behavior"" has already been identified as a higher risk category.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is skipped because ""Behavior"" has already been identified as a higher risk category.

Based on the hierarchy, ""Behavior"" is the highest applicable risk level.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I'm starting to think suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing"" and ""I need to leave."" While ""I need to leave"" implies a desire to end their presence, it does not specify a method, timing, location, or preparatory action. There is no concrete plan mentioned.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I'm starting to think suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing"" explicitly expresses a consideration and leaning towards suicide as a solution to their pain. ""I don't belong here. I need to leave"" reinforces a desire to no longer be alive. This clearly indicates an active suicidal desire.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is *considering* suicide as a solution; they are not rejecting or stating these thoughts are unwanted/intrusive. Therefore, it is not an Indicator due to negation.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as there is a clear expression of suicidal desire.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire/contemplation of suicide without any concrete plan, which fits the definition of Ideation.

The user post expresses a strong desire to die (""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""deserves to die,"" ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon"").

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post mentions a specific method (""hanging myself"") and preparatory actions (""I've been practicing hanging myself,"" ""I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct""). This clearly indicates a plan, which would classify it as `behavior`.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Yes, there is explicit and active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** No, the thoughts are not negated; they are embraced (""The thought makes me so happy,"" ""No one is going to convince me otherwise"").

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable.

5.  **Hierarchy Rule Check (Attempt?):** The definition of `attempt` includes ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts (e.g., 'I put the belt around my neck but then stopped') and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting. The focus is on the past action.""
    The phrase ""I've been practicing hanging myself"" describes a past physical action involving the means of suicide. This is a form of self-harm or an aborted attempt, even if framed as ""practice."" It's a physical engagement with the act, not just a mental plan. The example given for `attempt` (""I put a belt around my neck...I stopped"") is very similar in nature to ""practicing hanging myself."" Both involve physically engaging with a lethal method and then stopping, or doing so in a preparatory manner.

Since the post describes a past physical act (""practicing hanging myself"") that falls under the definition of `attempt` (as a form of self-harm or aborted attempt), and it also contains current ideation and planning, according to the hierarchy rule, the highest risk category present must be chosen. Therefore, the classification is `attempt`.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** The post clearly states, ""I want to die. I want to disappear."" and ""I will take myself away from here"". This confirms active suicidal desire.
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Timing:** ""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here"". This explicitly mentions a future timing (""one day"") for the act, even if not immediate tonight. The phrase ""I am on the edge"" also suggests a heightened state of immediacy or near-term risk.
        *   **Method/Location/Preparation:** Not explicitly detailed beyond ""take myself away from here"".

    Since there is clear suicidal ideation (""I want to die"") and a component of timing/future commitment to act (""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here""), this fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The ""on the edge"" further reinforces the severity.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While there is strong ideation, the presence of a plan component (future timing) elevates it beyond just 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is clearly expressing an active desire to die and a future commitment to act, not just general distress or rejected thoughts. So, it's not 'indicator'.

Based on the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is the highest risk category present.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and rules.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it is not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior**: The post does not express any specific plan (method, timing, location, preparation) for ending their life. So, it is not 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The post contains the phrase ""I just don't want to exist."" This phrase, in isolation, could suggest a desire to not be alive. However, immediately following this, the user states, ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish."" This is a crucial negation of suicidal intent.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user explicitly states a feeling that could be interpreted as a form of ideation (""I just don't want to exist"") but then clearly rejects or negates any actual suicidal intent (""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish.""). This fits the definition of 'Indicator' which includes posts where ""the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" The post expresses general distress, hopelessness (""I don't have any purpose in life""), and mental health struggles (""anxiety attacks""), but actively denies suicidal intent.

Therefore, despite the phrase ""I just don't want to exist,"" the explicit negation of suicidal intent (""Im not suicidal or something"") places this post in the Indicator category.

Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states: ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note... (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness."" This clearly describes a past suicide attempt. According to the ""Attempt"" definition and the Hierarchy Rule, if a post mentions a past attempt (which this does) AND current plans/ideation (which this also does, e.g., ""I dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""I want to take my life""), the category is Attempt.

Since ""Attempt"" is the highest risk category, I do not need to proceed further down the hierarchy.

The user post is ""How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end"".

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" directly implies that the user has already taken Valium with the intent to die, but fears the dosage was insufficient. This describes a past action taken with suicidal intent, which fits the definition of an 'Attempt' (specifically, a failed or ongoing attempt).
2.  **Check for Behavior:** While the post asks about dosage (a method) and expresses a desire to end the nightmare (ideation), the critical element is the statement ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough,"" which indicates an action has *already* been taken. This elevates it beyond mere planning or ideation.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** ""I just want this nightmare to end"" clearly expresses a desire to die. However, the presence of an implied past action (taking Valium) makes it higher risk than just ideation.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** This post is far beyond general distress or rejected thoughts.

According to the hierarchy, 'Attempt' is the highest risk level. The statement ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" signifies a past or very recent action taken with suicidal intent.

I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user's post needs to be classified based on the provided suicide risk hierarchy. I will go through the steps outlined.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post describes past actions and expresses a current desire not to live, but it does *not* contain any elements of a *current* plan (method, timing, location, preparation) for a *future* suicidal act.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states, ""yet I don't want to live at all."" This is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating their desire to not live; they are stating it directly. So, it's not an Indicator based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as there is clear ideation and descriptions of past actions.

5.  **Evaluate for Attempt:** The post describes multiple past actions that clearly fall under the ""Attempt"" definition:
    *   ""I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one."" - This is a detailed description of a past suicide attempt.
    *   ""Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar."" - This describes a past act of self-harm, which is included in the ""Attempt"" category definition (NSSI like cutting).
    *   ""Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived."" - This is another clear description of a past suicide attempt.
    The post also mentions ""Some of these are suicide attempts"".

6.  **Apply Hierarchy Rule:** The rules state: ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories (e.g., a past attempt and current plans), you must classify it as the highest risk category present."" And specifically: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""
    This post clearly describes multiple past suicide attempts (Attempt category) and also expresses current suicidal ideation (""I don't want to live at all""). According to the hierarchy rule, the presence of past attempts, especially when combined with current ideation, classifies the post as ""Attempt.""

Therefore, the highest risk level present is Attempt.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This is a clear description of a past aborted suicide attempt.
2.  **Apply Hierarchy Rule:** The instructions state: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post describes a past attempt and also contains current ideation (""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it,"" ""I just need someone to push me one more inch"").
3.  **Final Classification:** Since a past attempt is described, and this is the highest risk category, the classification is Attempt.

98,scared. too scared to kill myself but too tired of life. plus suicide is illegal here so if i fail i might get arrested or fined for it . fun,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, the user states they are ""too scared to kill myself"" and discusses hypothetical future consequences (""if i fail"").

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? The user explicitly states ""too scared to kill myself,"" which indicates a lack of a plan or intent to act, due to fear. There is no mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation. Therefore, it is not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? The phrase ""too tired of life"" expresses general distress and weariness. However, this is immediately followed by ""too scared to kill myself,"" which negates an active desire or intent to act on those feelings. The fear acts as a significant barrier to action or even a strong, active desire to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want, or clearly stating they will not act on them? The phrase ""too scared to kill myself"" directly indicates that despite being ""tired of life,"" the user is *not* acting on suicidal thoughts or desires due to fear. This aligns with the Indicator definition, which includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them. The fear of acting, and the legal consequences, serve as reasons for not wanting to act.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since none of the higher categories fit, and the post expresses general distress (""too tired of life"") while explicitly negating the intent to act on suicidal thoughts (""too scared to kill myself""), it falls into the Indicator category.
</thinking>

99,"Fuck this fucking world and the fucking people. We're all slaves to the fucking government working day in and day out for what? A few moments of happiness here and there? 12 years of required schooling only to be condemned to work the rest of our miserable lives most the time for paychecks barely enough to survive. This isn't fucking living. We are rotting away and people are acting indifferent to these facts. They consume the news and stuff of the media making themselves ignorant to the basic fact that human life has no fucking purpose other than living as a slave to make the rich richer and to slowly decay. We start dying the second we are born. This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good. So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user's post expresses extreme nihilism and hopelessness: ""Fuck this fucking world...This isn't fucking living. We are rotting away...human life has no fucking purpose...We start dying the second we are born."" This clearly indicates a desire to not be alive or to end their life, fulfilling the criteria for Ideation.

Next, I need to check for a plan, which would elevate it to Behavior. The post states: ""This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good.""
*   **Timing:** ""in April"" is a specific timeframe.
*   **Preparation:** ""This will be my second to last post"" suggests a farewell or preparatory action before an intended act.
*   **Implied Method/Location:** ""taking a trip...to end this bullshit for good"" implies a planned event, likely involving travel to a specific location or for a specific purpose related to ending their life.

The combination of clear suicidal ideation (""to end this bullshit for good"") and elements of a plan (timing, preparation, implied location/method) fits the definition of **Behavior**.

Finally, I check for Attempt. The post describes a future action, not a past one, so it's not an Attempt.

Since Behavior is the highest risk category present, that will be the classification.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It mentions ""od on meds"" but as a wish, not a past action.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior):** The post states, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"". This expresses a desire for specific methods of dying (""get hit by a car"", ""od on meds""). According to the definition, a ""plan"" includes mentioning a ""Method: Mentioning tools, substances, weapons (e.g., pills, buying a rope)."" ""Od on meds"" directly refers to a substance/method. ""Get hit by a car"" is also a specific method. The presence of these specific methods, even if framed as a wish, constitutes a component of planning, elevating the risk from Ideation.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post clearly expresses a desire to die through the phrases ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"". This is active suicidal desire. However, because it includes specific methods, it moves beyond simple Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is expressing a genuine desire for these outcomes, not rejecting or negating them. Therefore, it is not an Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post contains active suicidal desire (""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"") and mentions specific methods (""get hit by a car"", ""od on meds""), which falls under the ""plan"" component for Behavior.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: I will scan the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to ending one's life.
    *   The post expresses extreme distress, frustration, and self-loathing (""daily torture of living life,"" ""Being unwanted in literally all facets of life""). However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, timing, or preparatory actions related to suicide.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: Since there's no plan, I'll check if the post expresses a direct desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   I'm looking for phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to end it all,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I'm going to die soon,"" ""I wish I were dead.""
    *   The post states ""You can't begin to imagine the daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body."" This describes the *experience* of living as torture, but it does not explicitly state a desire to *die* or *end* that life. It expresses profound unhappiness with their existence and a wish to have been born differently (""I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way""), but not a direct desire for cessation of life. The focus is on the *quality* of life, not the desire for its *absence*.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The post does not contain any explicit suicidal thoughts that are then negated.

4.  **Default to Indicator**: If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, hopelessness, and significant mental health struggles related to self-image and feeling unwanted. It describes the ""daily torture of living life"" and profound dissatisfaction with their existence, but it stops short of explicitly stating a desire to die. This aligns with the definition of Indicator.

Based on this analysis, the post conveys intense distress and hopelessness but lacks a direct statement of suicidal ideation or any planning.

The user post states: 'Just a phase'. Was told that me being suicidal is 'just a phase' because of my age despite me being abused and severely mentally ill. I've tried to kill myself 8 times. I'm tired of people's ignorance

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post mentions ""me being suicidal"" which indicates current ideation, but it does not describe any specific plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) for a *future* suicidal act. The phrase ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" refers to *past* actions, not a current plan. So, it's not Behavior based on a current plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""me being suicidal"" clearly expresses an active desire or state of being suicidal. This fits the Ideation category.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is stating ""me being suicidal"" as a personal state, not as an intrusive thought they are rejecting. Therefore, it's not an Indicator based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Ideation is present, so we don't default to Indicator at this stage.

5.  **Re-evaluate with Hierarchy and Attempt Definition:** The post explicitly states, ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" According to the definition of 'Attempt', this describes a past act of a suicide attempt. The definition also states: ""Hierarchy Rule: If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Since the post mentions past attempts (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"") and current ideation (""me being suicidal""), the highest risk category per the hierarchy is Attempt.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I'm better off dead,"" which indicates suicidal ideation. However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I'm better off dead"" clearly expresses a desire to not be alive or to die. This is a direct statement of intent/desire, not just general distress.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting the thought ""I'm better off dead."" They are presenting it as their own perspective, contrasting it with others' reactions. It is not an intrusive thought they are fighting against.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die without any planning component, fitting the definition of Ideation.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an ho ur ago"". This describes a past action of self-harm, specifically an overdose. The definition of ""Attempt"" includes ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt."" This clearly fits.
2.  **Hierarchy Rule:** The hierarchy states that if a post contains elements of multiple categories, classify it as the highest risk category present. Since a past attempt is clearly described, it takes precedence over any current ideation or lack thereof. Even though the user states ""i dont think i want to die,"" the physical act of taking a large dose of medication has already occurred, making it an Attempt.

The user post is: ""I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post explicitly states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" indicating a clear *absence* of a plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). Therefore, it is not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I want to end it"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to die or end one's life. This goes beyond general sadness or hopelessness.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user states ""I want to end it,"" which shows an active desire, not a rejection or negation of suicidal thoughts. The ""but I have no idea how, when or anything else"" refers to the *lack of a plan*, not a lack of desire. Therefore, it is not an Indicator due to negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as an active suicidal desire (Ideation) has been identified.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical classification process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses significant distress, exhaustion, and hopelessness (""I really can't handle it anymore,"" ""I don't know what to do with myself,"" ""I'm exhausted,"" ""it feels completely hopeless""). However, it does not mention any specific plan components such as a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for suicide. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post conveys extreme emotional pain, feeling overwhelmed, and a sense of hopelessness about their current situation. Phrases like ""I really can't handle it anymore,"" ""I don't know what to do with myself,"" ""I'm exhausted,"" and ""it feels completely hopeless"" indicate a severe struggle with life. However, it does not explicitly state a desire to die, to not be alive, or to end one's life. It lacks direct phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" The focus is on the inability to cope with their current state and feelings of being overwhelmed, rather than a direct wish for cessation of life.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The post does not mention suicidal thoughts that are then rejected or unwanted (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to"").

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt', 'Behavior', or 'Ideation' (due to the lack of explicit desire to die or a plan), it falls into the 'Indicator' category. The post clearly expresses general distress, hopelessness, and significant mental health struggles without a stated personal, active desire to die.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will go through the hierarchy from most severe to least severe.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a past ""rock bottom"" which included ""really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday for nearly 2 years."" This describes severe past distress and struggles, but it does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt (aborted or completed). ""Almost being abusive"" is not a suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not an 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? The post does not express any active suicidal thoughts or desire to die. The phrase ""once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death"" is a general philosophical statement about the concept of rock bottom and recovery, not a personal expression of suicidal intent or a plan. The user is actually talking about *getting better* after hitting rock bottom. Therefore, it is not 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive, to die, or to end one's life? No. The user states they are ""in therapy again btw so it might get better for me,"" they've been ""overall better compared to the rest of my life,"" and they ""feel more like myself. starting to accept who i am."" They also offer positive encouragement to others: ""there's always a way to improve on something even if your at rock bottom."" The mention of ""death"" is within the context of a philosophical statement about hitting rock bottom and then improving, not a personal desire for death. Therefore, it is not 'ideation'.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since none of the above categories fit, I will check if it fits 'indicator'. The post discusses a new bipolar diagnosis, past mental health struggles (""really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns""), and feelings of being ""lonely and lost as ever."" While these are elements of distress, the overall tone is one of self-awareness, seeking help (therapy), improvement (""overall better,"" ""way better""), and even offering positive advice to others. It discusses mental health struggles and the concept of ""rock bottom"" (which includes ""death"" as the lowest point) thematically, but it lacks a personal, active desire to die. The user explicitly states they are improving and accepting themselves. This fits the definition of 'indicator' as it shows general distress and discusses mental health thematically, but lacks a personal, active desire to die and does not contain negated suicidal thoughts.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a *future* plan (""plan on ending it soon,"" ""likely my go-to plan""), not a past act of self-harm or an aborted attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** The phrase ""plan on ending it soon"" clearly expresses an active desire to end one's life.
    *   **Plan Elements:**
        *   **Method:** The user explicitly mentions ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" as a ""go-to plan."" This is a specific method.
        *   **Timing:** The user states ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon."" While uncertain, these are specific timeframes, not just a vague ""someday.""
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and specific elements of a plan (method and potential timing), the post fits the 'Behavior' category.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Not applicable, as 'Behavior' is a higher risk category and has been identified.)

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts/Indicator:** (Not applicable, as 'Behavior' is a higher risk category and has been identified. The user is expressing a desire to act, not rejecting intrusive thoughts.)

The user is expressing distress related to a relapse in a pornography addiction.
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a ""relapse"" related to pornography, not a past suicide attempt or self-harm. So, not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The user states, ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"". This explicitly mentions suicidal ideation (""I'd kill myself"") and a specific method (""a gun""). Even though it's conditional (""If I had a gun""), the mention of a specific method constitutes a component of planning. This fits the definition of Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** While there is clear ideation (""I'd kill myself""), the presence of a method elevates it beyond just ideation.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not negating the suicidal thought; rather, they are expressing a desire to act if a means were available.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of a method (""a gun"") alongside suicidal ideation classifies this as Behavior.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""i just wanna kill myself before i have to see him or myself get it"". While there's a conditional trigger (""before I have to see him or myself get it""), it doesn't specify a method, a concrete timing (like ""tonight"" or ""at 21""), a location, or any preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post clearly states ""i just wanna kill myself"". This is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to die.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user does not express suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want. The statement ""i just wanna kill myself"" is an active desire, not an intrusive thought they are fighting against.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not reached as active suicidal desire (Ideation) has been identified.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear, active desire to die (""i just wanna kill myself"") but lacks any concrete plan elements. This fits the definition of Ideation.

111,My last time posting on this account. I've got a suicide plan. Hello. I've finally got a plan on how i can kill myself and after thinking it over i'm pretty sure this will work. I plan on doing it next week and i'm excited to finally move on from this worthless existence. These past years have shit and i hope I don't get cold feet. Goodbye reddit thanks for the support and thanks for listening.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user is expressing clear suicidal thoughts: ""I've got a suicide plan,"" ""how I can kill myself,"" ""excited to finally move on from this worthless existence.""
I need to check for elements of a plan.
The post explicitly states, ""I've got a suicide plan.""
It also specifies timing: ""I plan on doing it next week.""
Additionally, ""My last time posting on this account"" and ""Goodbye reddit"" can be interpreted as preparatory actions or saying goodbye.
Since there is clear suicidal ideation combined with a specific timing (""next week"") and the explicit mention of having a ""plan,"" this falls under the 'Behavior' category.
It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
It goes beyond just ideation because a plan component (timing) is present.
It's not an indicator because the thoughts are active and desired, not negated.
Therefore, the highest risk category present is Behavior.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user post explicitly states: ""I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago).""

According to the ""Attempt"" definition: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts (e.g., 'I put the belt around my neck but then stopped') and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting. The focus is on the past action. Hierarchy Rule: If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""

The post also mentions ""this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again,"" indicating current ideation. Since a past attempt is explicitly stated, and there is also current ideation, the ""Hierarchy Rule"" dictates that the classification is Attempt. The rest of the post describes distress, pain, and seeking help, but the mention of a past attempt overrides these for classification purposes.

It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and then select the appropriate category.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post states: ""I don't even open up to my best friends about my depression and thoughts of sh."" and ""I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best.""
    *   ""Thoughts of sh"" indicates ideation or past engagement with self-harm, but not a *description of a past act* in this post.
    *   ""I can't even cut"" refers to a *current inability* to perform a coping mechanism, not a description of an actual past cutting incident.
    *   Therefore, this is not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post expresses significant distress (""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""I'm suffering,"" ""I think I would go insane,"" ""It's getting to be too much"").
    *   It mentions ""thoughts of sh"" and ""I can't even cut."" While self-harm can be related to suicide, the post frames ""cutting"" as a ""way that works best"" to ""cope,"" implying it's a coping mechanism for distress, not necessarily a method for suicide in this context. There is no explicit statement of a desire to die or end life.
    *   There is no mention of a specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for suicide.
    *   Therefore, this is not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The post expresses extreme distress, hopelessness, and feeling overwhelmed (""It's getting to be too much""). It mentions ""thoughts of sh"" and the inability to use cutting as a coping mechanism.
    *   However, there are no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I want to end it all,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" The distress is clear, but a direct, active desire for death is not explicitly stated. The focus is on suffering and inability to cope.
    *   Therefore, this is not Ideation.

4.  **Default to Indicator**: If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly shows general distress (""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""I'm suffering,"" ""It's getting to be too much"").
    *   It discusses mental health struggles (""depression and thoughts of sh"").
    *   It lacks a personal, active desire to die or a plan. The mention of ""thoughts of sh"" and ""can't even cut"" falls under discussing mental health struggles and coping difficulties, rather than active suicidal ideation or a plan for suicide.
    *   The crucial rule for Indicator includes posts where the user discusses suicidal thoughts thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die. This post discusses ""thoughts of sh"" as part of their internal struggle and coping difficulties.

Based on this analysis, the post best fits the definition of Indicator.

114,"Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over. If you really loved me, you'd want me to be happy. The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and then select the appropriate category.

**Step 1: Thinking Process**

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**:
    *   Does the post mention a method (e.g., pills, rope)? No.
    *   Does it mention timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"")? No. The phrase ""when I die"" is an expectation, not a specific time for an act.
    *   Does it mention a location (e.g., a bridge)? No.
    *   Does it mention preparation (e.g., writing a note)? No.
    *   **Conclusion**: There are no elements of a plan. Therefore, it is not ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**:
    *   Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? Yes.
    *   Phrases: ""Don't be sad when I die,"" ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead.""
    *   These phrases clearly indicate a personal desire for death as a solution to pain and a path to happiness.
    *   **Conclusion**: Yes, there is an active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**:
    *   Does the user mention suicidal thoughts but clearly reject them or state they do not want to act on them? No. The user embraces the idea of death as a desired outcome. There's no negation like ""but I don't actually want to.""
    *   **Conclusion**: This is not an ""Indicator"" based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator**: Since ""Ideation"" fits, it does not default to ""Indicator.""

**Step 2: Category Definitions Review**

*   **Attempt**: No past self-harm or attempt is described.
*   **Behavior**: No plan is present.
*   **Ideation**: The post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive (""when I die,"" ""if I'm dead"" as the only way to be happy) but without any concrete plan. This aligns perfectly.
*   **Indicator**: The post goes beyond general distress; it states a clear desire for death. It does not negate the suicidal thoughts.

**Step 3: Examples to Guide Reasoning**

*   The example ""I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon"" is classified as Ideation because it expresses a direct desire/expectation to not be alive without a plan. The current post (""Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over. If you really loved me, you'd want me to be happy. The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."") similarly expresses a direct desire for death as a solution, lacking a plan.

**Step 4: Final Classification**

The post clearly expresses a desire to die as a means to end pain and achieve happiness, but it does not include any specific plan elements (method, timing, location, preparation). This fits the definition of Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** Does the post describe a *past* act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post states, ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself."" This describes a *current decision* or *intent*, not a past completed action.
    *   There is no mention of a physical action that has already occurred (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I cut myself"").
    *   Therefore, it is not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself,"" ""I don't want to live."" This clearly expresses suicidal ideation.
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Method:** ""take the leap"" is metaphorical and doesn't specify a concrete method (e.g., pills, rope).
        *   **Timing:** No specific timing is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight"").
        *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
        *   **Preparation:** The phrase ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"" indicates a firm decision has been made, which is a significant step towards action. The word ""goodbye"" at the end is a clear preparatory action, signaling a farewell before an imminent act.
    *   The combination of a firm decision to act (""I finally decided to take the leap"") and a farewell (""goodbye"") constitutes strong elements of preparation for an imminent act. This elevates the risk beyond mere ideation.
    *   Therefore, this fits the criteria for Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is skipped because elements of a plan were identified, placing it in the Behavior category.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is skipped as the intent is clear and not negated.

Based on the analysis, the presence of a firm decision to act and a farewell (""goodbye"") indicates a preparatory action, classifying it as Behavior.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The post states ""Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all."" The phrase ""one last time before i end it all"" strongly implies a specific, imminent timing and a preparatory action (playing the game as a final act).
    *   ""Playing witcher 3 before i call it quits"" reinforces this timing and preparatory action.
    *   The ""Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)"" is a clear farewell, which is a strong indicator of a preparatory action.
    *   While no specific method or location is mentioned, the combination of implied timing (""one last time before"", ""before I call it quits"") and preparatory actions (playing the game, saying goodbye) constitutes a plan component.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   ""before i end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""i feel so relaxed that it's finally ending"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"" all explicitly express a desire to die or end one's life. This clearly meets the criteria for Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   There are no phrases indicating the user is rejecting or not wanting these thoughts. The user expresses a sense of peace and finality.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk categories are present.

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation (""end it all"", ""call it quits"") and elements of a plan, specifically implied timing (""one last time before"", ""before I call it quits"") and preparatory actions (playing the game as a final act, saying ""Goodbye""). According to the hierarchy, ideation with a plan component falls under Behavior.

She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
The goal is to classify the suicide risk level of the *person writing the post*.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the poster describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt *by themselves*?
    *   No. The poster describes someone *else's* past attempt (""She wrote three days ago that she had tried to kill herself""). The poster is asking for help about *that person*, not themselves.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the poster express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan *by themselves*?
    *   No. The poster is expressing concern and fear for *another person's* well-being. They are not expressing their own suicidal thoughts or plans.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the poster express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life *by themselves*?
    *   No. The poster says ""I need help"" and ""I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?"". These are expressions of distress and a request for advice regarding *another person*, not a personal desire to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want *by themselves*?
    *   No. The poster is not expressing any suicidal thoughts, negated or otherwise.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post expresses general distress (""I need help,"" ""I'm scared"") and discusses a mental health crisis involving *another person*. While the topic is suicide, the *poster* is not expressing *their own* suicidal ideation or intent. They are seeking help and expressing concern about a friend. This fits the definition of Indicator, as it's general distress and a thematic discussion of suicide without personal, active desire to die from the poster.

The user post states: ""I will hang myself now. I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it...""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes *current* intent and *current* preparatory actions (""I will hang myself now,"" ""I'm now looking for something""), not a past completed or aborted attempt. The phrase ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" refers to past non-suicidal self-injury, not a past suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I will hang myself now.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Method:** ""hang myself"" - Yes.
        *   **Timing:** ""now"" - Yes, immediate.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it"" - Yes, active preparation.
    Since suicidal thoughts are present along with a clear method, immediate timing, and active preparation, this falls under the 'Behavior' category.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is skipped because 'Behavior' has been identified, which is a higher risk category than 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is skipped because 'Behavior' has been identified.

**Conclusion:** The post explicitly states an immediate intent to die by a specific method and describes active steps being taken to implement that plan. This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   No, the post does not describe any past actions.
    *   *Conclusion: Not Attempt.*

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post explicitly states: ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This directly contradicts the presence of suicidal thoughts/desire.
    *   There is no mention of a plan.
    *   *Conclusion: Not Behavior.*

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die?
    *   The post states: ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This is a direct negation of a desire to die. While the user expresses extreme distress, misery, and inability to function, they explicitly state they do *not* want to die.
    *   *Conclusion: Not Ideation.*

4.  **Check for Indicator / Default to Indicator:**
    *   The post expresses general distress (""shattered,"" ""shitty,"" ""miserable,"" ""can barely function,"" ""can't stop shaking"") and hopelessness (""don't even know how to just live anymore,"" ""How am I supposed to live like this?"").
    *   It also contains the crucial phrase ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" which aligns with the ""Crucial Rule"" for Indicator: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" Although they don't explicitly say ""suicidal thoughts,"" they negate the *desire to die*, which is the core of Ideation. The post is about severe distress and inability to cope, without a stated desire for death.
    *   *Conclusion: This fits the definition of Indicator.*

Based on this analysis, the post describes severe distress and hopelessness but explicitly negates a desire to die, placing it in the Indicator category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts (aborted or completed). So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   Does the post mention a method (e.g., pills, rope)? No.
    *   Does it specify timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"")? No. The phrase ""I want out now"" refers to wanting to escape the current situation, not a specific timing for a suicidal act.
    *   Does it mention a location (e.g., a bridge)? No.
    *   Does it describe preparation (e.g., writing a note)? No.
    Since no elements of a plan are present, it's not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   The post explicitly states: ""I just want to kill myself.""
    *   It also states: ""I want out."" In the context of ""I just want to kill myself,"" this reinforces the desire to end their life/existence.
    This clearly indicates an active desire to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   The user expresses ""I just want to kill myself"" and ""I want out"" without any negation or rejection of these thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't actually want to""). The desire is presented as genuine. Therefore, it's not 'Indicator' based on negated thoughts.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not reached because an active suicidal desire was identified.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear and active desire to die (""I just want to kill myself"") but lacks any concrete plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

The user post begins with ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (likely ""I want to die""), which is an expression of suicidal ideation.
However, immediately following this, the post contains a strong negation of these thoughts: ""even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself."" This explicitly states that the user believes they will not act on these thoughts and views them as a ""cope"" or ""distraction.""

According to the ""Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)"" rule: ""Before finalizing on Ideation, check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. For example, 'My brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to.' These are intrusive thoughts and should be classified as Indicator."" The post clearly fits this description as the user mentions suicidal thoughts but then explicitly rejects the idea of acting on them (""You will never do it"").

The latter part of the post discusses hypothetical destructive acts (""If you change your mind and you want to do it... Go out with bang, and big flames... Learn how to make nitroglycerin... Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants""). While alarming, these are presented hypothetically and in the context of the user having just stated they ""will never do it."" The focus is on general mayhem rather than a specific, personal suicide plan, especially given the preceding negation of suicidal intent. The prompt states that ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post."" Given the explicit negation of their own suicidal thoughts, the primary risk level for *suicide* for the person writing the post falls into the Indicator category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post, specifically for the person *writing* the post.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt by the user. It describes a friend being bullied.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not express suicidal thoughts or a plan by the user. It describes the bullying of a friend.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post does not express a desire to die, to not be alive, or to end one's life by the user. It describes the distress of a friend.
4.  **Check for Indicator:**
    *   Does the post show general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles *from the user*? The user is clearly distressed by their friend's severe bullying and is seeking help (""Justice needs to be served""). This indicates general distress on the user's part regarding the situation.
    *   Does it discuss suicide thematically but lack a personal, active desire to die? Yes, the post explicitly quotes the bully telling the friend to ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself."" This introduces the *theme* of suicide into the post, even though it's not the user's own suicidal thought.
    *   Does the user mention suicidal thoughts but reject them? No, this specific aspect is not present.

Given the rules, especially ""If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die. This is an Indicator,"" and ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them (e.g., intrusive or unwanted thoughts),"" and importantly, ""discusses suicide thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die.""

The user is expressing significant distress *about a situation* that involves the theme of suicide, and they are seeking help. While the direct suicidal content is from the bully's words, the user is relaying this and showing distress about the overall situation. This fits the ""general distress"" and ""discusses suicide thematically"" aspects of the Indicator category for the user writing the post.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states, ""I want to hang myself so bad."" This explicitly mentions a method (""hang myself""). The presence of a method, even without specific timing or location, qualifies as a component of a plan. Therefore, this points towards the 'Behavior' category.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains phrases like ""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" and ""I want to hang myself so bad."" These clearly express an active desire to die. This would classify it as 'Ideation' if no plan were present.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** While the user mentions ""holding on a bit because I have a small piece of hope left,"" this does not negate the strong, active desire to die or the explicit mention of a method. The thoughts are not presented as unwanted or intrusive that the user is fighting against; rather, they are a strong desire that the user is barely resisting.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as higher risk categories are present.

**Hierarchy Application:** The post contains clear active suicidal desire (Ideation) AND a specific method (""hang myself""), which is a component of a plan. According to the hierarchy, if a post includes suicidal ideation and a component of planning, it is classified as 'Behavior'.

The user post states: ""so last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time?"". This is a direct and explicit description of a past suicide attempt. The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt."" It also includes the crucial rule: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post also contains ""still want to attempt again,"" which is current ideation. Because a past attempt is clearly described, and current ideation is also present, the highest risk category according to the hierarchy is Attempt.

I know I'll wake up later, and while I know this, I want so badly to reach out to my friends and ask them to check up on me but I don't want to put them through something as scary as this. I don't want them to have to deal with me during this. I knew this morning the moment I woke up that it would lead to this. I've thought about it all day and throughout I've tried to be happy and loud so they wouldn't worry, so they wouldn't know what I was really thinking. I'm scared right now but I know I'll wake up. I'm sad right now and I want nothing more than someone to sit with me in silence while I cry. But I'm alone. I can't reach out. So all I ask is this, please check up on me later.

The user is describing a current physical state (""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting"") that is directly related to a suicidal act, which they are ""too scared to go all the way through."" They also explicitly state, ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" This indicates a history of past, non-lethal or aborted self-harm actions. The combination of a description of a current, ongoing (though aborted) self-harm act and a history of similar past actions aligns with the definition of ""Attempt,"" which includes aborted attempts and NSSI in a suicidal context. The presence of a past attempt, even if combined with current ideation (""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up""), means the highest risk category is Attempt according to the hierarchy rule.

I have ran out of chances. Goodbye.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a current situation (""I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side"") and an imminent action (""I am going to shoot myself""). It talks about ""the attempt could fail,"" referring to an *upcoming* attempt, not a *past* completed or aborted act. The definition of ""Attempt"" specifically states ""describes a *past* act."" Therefore, this is not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** Yes, explicitly stated (""intent to kill myself,"" ""I am going to shoot myself,"" ""I could die"").
    *   **Plan components:**
        *   **Method:** ""loaded gun by my side,"" ""I am going to shoot myself."" (Present and clear)
        *   **Timing:** ""It's time,"" ""Not until now,"" ""Too late to turn back now!"" (Implies immediate or imminent timing)
        *   **Preparation:** ""I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side,"" ""Every other account is gone, deleted,"" ""I have no more savings, my room is empty, everything is gone."" (Extensive preparatory actions)
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and multiple elements of a concrete plan (method, implied timing, extensive preparation) are present, the classification is Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While ideation is present, the presence of a detailed plan elevates the risk beyond Ideation.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is clearly expressing an active desire to die and concrete plans, not rejecting thoughts or general distress.

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation combined with a specific method (loaded gun), implied imminent timing, and detailed preparatory actions (deleting accounts, emptying room, no savings). This fits the definition of Behavior.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the social media post. I need to follow the provided hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""tried to pass a week ago."" It then details the event: ""a week ago i got into a fight with my sister, i had a suicide episode which made me leave a note for my parents saying its my last time with them and i had a lot of things hidden inside me, then i got to the bathroom grabbed the bleach and swallowed it, i thought that was the last breath i have but luckily i vomited."" This is a clear description of a past suicide attempt, including preparatory actions (leaving a note) and the act itself (swallowing bleach).
2.  **Hierarchy Rule:** According to the rules, if a post describes a past suicide attempt, it is classified as 'Attempt', regardless of current feelings or statements of being ""better now."" The presence of a past attempt is the highest risk factor in the hierarchy.

Since a past attempt is clearly described, the classification is 'Attempt'. I do not need to check for Behavior, Ideation, or Indicator as 'Attempt' is the highest category.

The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child :/ please help",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the four-step process:

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for mentions of method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   The post states, ""I still want to die,"" but it does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note).
    *   Therefore, it does not fit the 'Behavior' category.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   The post clearly states, ""After the funeral I basically lost all will to live.""
    *   It also explicitly says, ""I still want to die.""
    *   These are direct expressions of active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The user states, ""I still want to die."" This is not a negated thought. While they mention a reason for *not acting* (""The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents...""), this is a protective factor, not a rejection of the *desire* itself. The desire to die is clearly present and active.
    *   Therefore, it does not fit the 'Indicator' category based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as active suicidal desire (Ideation) has been identified.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt or self-harm described.
*   **Behavior:** No plan identified.
*   **Ideation:** Active suicidal desire (""I still want to die"") is present without a plan. This fits the definition of Ideation.
*   **Indicator:** The desire to die is active, not general distress or rejected thoughts.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire to die without any concrete plan, which aligns with the 'Ideation' category.

I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It discusses current feelings and a potential future action (taking acid) as a last resort, not a past attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The user states ""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. They then mention taking ""a few tabs of acid and see what happens first."" This is presented as an attempt to *avert* suicide, not as a suicide method itself. They explicitly state, ""if it helps me then hey that's great , if it doesn't , I'll be back in the same spot or worse off than before and my end will only get nearer."" While ""my end will only get nearer"" strongly implies future suicide, it does not specify a concrete method, timing, location, or preparatory action for *that* future suicide. It expresses an acceptance of death as a likely outcome if their current coping mechanism fails, but not a plan for *how* it will occur.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The post clearly expresses a desire to die or an acceptance of death as a likely outcome: ""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end."" and ""my end will only get nearer. I'm fine with either outcome."" This goes beyond general distress and indicates a clear desire/expectation of death.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. They are actively considering suicide as a potential outcome and are ""fine with either outcome,"" which includes death.
5.  **Default to Indicator?** No, because active suicidal desire (Ideation) is clearly present.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire/acceptance of death (""my end will only get nearer. I'm fine with either outcome"") and prolonged suicidal thoughts (""thinking of suicide for months on end""), but it does not include a concrete plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) for the suicide itself. The acid is presented as a last-ditch effort to *avoid* suicide, not as the suicide method. Therefore, it fits the definition of Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk of the provided post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post says: ""tonight i stole some my dog's prescription hydrocodone just to feel ok for one night. ive had a bit to drink tonight as well.""
    *   While this describes substance misuse, the stated intent is ""just to feel ok,"" not to end life or self-harm in a suicidal way. It is a coping mechanism, not an attempt as defined.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan?
    *   The post does not explicitly express suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to kill myself"").
    *   Therefore, even though there's a mention of substance use, it's not linked to a suicidal plan.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The post states: ""i hit a new low tonight,"" ""i havent felt ok in a while and im not sure what to do.""
    *   These phrases convey significant distress, hopelessness, and feeling lost, but they do *not* explicitly state a desire to die or to end one's life. There is no ""I want to die"" or equivalent statement.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts:** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   No explicit suicidal thoughts are mentioned, so this is not applicable.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly shows general distress (""hit a new low,"" ""haven't felt ok in a while,"" ""not sure what to do"").
    *   It describes risky coping behaviors (misusing medication and alcohol) driven by this distress, but the *explicit intent* stated for these actions is to ""feel ok,"" not to die.
    *   Since there's no explicit desire to die or a suicidal plan/attempt, and it expresses general distress and hopelessness, it falls into the Indicator category.

**Conclusion:** The post describes significant distress and risky coping mechanisms, but lacks any explicit suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk of the post ""31/m - I see no point in living anymore. I don't have any friends. Nothing in my life is working out"".

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior**: The post expresses a feeling (""I see no point in living anymore"") and reasons for it (""I don't have any friends. Nothing in my life is working out""). However, it does not mention any specific plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) to act on this feeling. So, not 'behavior'.
3.  **Check for Ideation**: The phrase ""I see no point in living anymore"" directly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or a lack of desire to continue living. This goes beyond general distress and signifies an active suicidal desire, even if passive in its phrasing. It does not include a plan. This fits the definition of 'ideation'.
4.  **Check for Indicator**: An 'indicator' would be general distress, hopelessness, or suicidal thoughts that are explicitly rejected. While there is hopelessness, the core statement ""I see no point in living anymore"" is a personal, active expression of a desire for life to end, not a rejected thought. Therefore, it's stronger than an 'indicator'.

Based on the hierarchy and definitions, ""I see no point in living anymore"" clearly falls under 'ideation' because it expresses a desire to not be alive without a concrete plan.

The user post describes a past action: ""taken a fuck load of pills"". This is a concrete action that has already occurred. The phrase ""might not wake up tomorrow"" indicates the intended outcome of this action, which is death.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    The post states: ""I have a fear of failing an attempt once again."" This explicitly mentions a past attempt. According to the hierarchy rule, if a past attempt is mentioned, it's the highest risk category.

2.  **Check for Behavior (if not Attempt):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan?
    The post says: ""I'm planning out my suicide..."" (preparation/planning). It also specifies timing: ""I have an intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest."" This clearly indicates a plan.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    The post says: ""I'm planning out my suicide,"" and ""I will go through with this, for I can't find a reason nor can I create one to continue living."" This is a very strong expression of active suicidal desire.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Are suicidal thoughts mentioned but clearly rejected?
    No, the user is affirming their intent, not rejecting it.

**Conclusion based on hierarchy:** The post clearly mentions a past attempt (""failing an attempt once again""). Even though it also contains strong ideation and detailed planning (behavioral elements), the mention of a past attempt elevates it to the highest risk category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the four-step thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   Does the post mention a method? No.
    *   Does the post mention timing? The phrase ""sometimes i wonder if i should just do it now"" is a contemplation of timing, but it's immediately followed by ""For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born,"" which indicates a lack of immediate intent or concrete plan for timing. It's a hypothetical thought, not a stated plan.
    *   Does the post mention a location? No.
    *   Does the post mention preparation? No.
    *   Conclusion: There is no concrete plan present. Therefore, the post is not at the Behavior level.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   The post states: ""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore."" This is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive.
    *   It also states: ""I actually hate being alive."" This reinforces the desire to not be alive.
    *   It states: ""sometimes i wonder if i should just do it now."" This indicates contemplation of ending one's life.
    *   It states: ""wish i was never born."" This expresses a desire to not have existed, which aligns with not wanting to be alive.
    *   Conclusion: The post clearly expresses an active desire to not be alive/to die.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   The user expresses ""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore"" and ""I actually hate being alive."" These are *active desires*, not thoughts that are being rejected or stated as unwanted.
    *   While the user mentions being ""too scared to kill myself"" and not wanting to ""weigh down my family and friends,"" these are reasons *not to act* on the suicidal desire, not a negation of the desire itself. The desire to die is still very much present and personal.
    *   Conclusion: The suicidal thoughts/desires are not negated.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since active suicidal desire (Ideation) was identified, this step is not applicable.

**Final Classification Reasoning:** The post explicitly expresses a strong desire to not be alive (""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore,"" ""I actually hate being alive,"" ""wish i was never born""). However, it lacks any concrete plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). The reasons for not acting (fear, concern for family) do not negate the active desire to die. Therefore, it fits the definition of Ideation.

The user is describing a recurring behavior: ""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die.""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The definition of ""Attempt"" states: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts (e.g., 'I put the belt around my neck but then stopped') and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting. The focus is on the past action.""
    The user's description ""i hang myself but always leave a chair...so i don't die"" is a clear example of an aborted attempt, similar to the provided example ""I put the belt around my neck but then stopped."" The word ""frequently"" indicates these are repeated past actions. This directly fits the ""Attempt"" category.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** This is not a current plan to die, but a description of past actions.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** While the actions are suicidal in nature, the explicit statement ""so i don't die"" suggests the *immediate* intent of these specific actions is not to complete suicide, but the actions themselves are still ""attempt suicide."" However, the ""Attempt"" category takes precedence if a past attempt is described.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** This goes far beyond general distress or rejected thoughts; it describes direct engagement with a suicidal method, even if aborted.

According to the hierarchy, if a post contains elements of multiple categories, I must classify it as the highest risk category present. The description of repeated, aborted suicide attempts clearly falls under the ""Attempt"" category.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will scan the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to ending their life.
    *   The post mentions ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"" and ""I guess this world's just not meant for me,"" which are expressions of suicidal desire.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    *   Therefore, the post does not contain elements of a ""plan"" that would classify it as Behavior *based on current planning*.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to die or not be alive.
    *   ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now"" - Indicates a history of suicidal thoughts.
    *   ""I see no point anymore"" - Expresses hopelessness and lack of purpose.
    *   ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"" - This is a clear and direct expression of a desire to not continue living.
    *   ""it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me"" - This also conveys a desire to end life.
    *   Based on these phrases, there is clear active suicidal desire, which would typically lead to an ""Ideation"" classification if no higher risk is present.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts but actively rejecting them.
    *   The user does not negate their suicidal thoughts. Phrases like ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"" are direct expressions of their current state, not unwanted intrusive thoughts.
    *   Therefore, it is not an ""Indicator"" based on negation.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is only applied if none of the above categories fit. Since active suicidal desire is present, it is not an ""Indicator"" by default.

5.  **Hierarchy Rule Check (Specifically for ""Attempt""):** The definition for ""Attempt"" states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""
    *   The post clearly states: ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, **i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out**. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed."" This explicitly describes a past suicide attempt.
    *   The post also contains current ideation: ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore.""
    *   Since the post describes a past suicide attempt and also expresses current ideation, according to the hierarchy rule, the highest risk category is ""Attempt.""

Final decision: The presence of a described past suicide attempt, combined with current ideation, elevates the classification to ""Attempt.""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I am 29 still live with my parents"" followed by gibberish and ""fuckkkkkkkk"". There is no mention of suicidal thoughts, a method, timing, location, or preparation. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post does not contain any phrases expressing a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead""). It expresses frustration and distress, but not suicidal ideation. Therefore, it is not Ideation.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The post does not mention any suicidal thoughts that are then rejected.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post does not fit Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation, I will check if it fits the default for Indicator. The post expresses general distress and frustration (""I am 29 still live with my parents."" and ""fuckkkkkkkk""). The gibberish could also be interpreted as an expression of extreme distress or dysregulation. This aligns with the definition of Indicator: ""The post shows general distress, hopelessness, or discusses suicide thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die.""

I'll break killing myself regardless.I just wish I could die in my sleep instead. Maybe I'll get lucky and increase my chances of corona if I start cutting again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user post contains several elements that need to be evaluated against the risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""I've done it many times"" and ""if I start cutting again."" ""I've done it many times"" strongly implies past suicide attempts or significant self-harm. ""Cutting"" is explicitly mentioned as something done in the past and considered again, which falls under Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) and is categorized under 'Attempt' as per the definition (""This includes aborted attempts... and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting. The focus is on the past action."").
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post mentions ""I figured out how to properly hang myself,"" which describes a method, a component of a plan. It also says, ""One of these days I'll finally do it,"" indicating future intent.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** Phrases like ""I'm not afraid of killing myself anymore,"" ""I'll break killing myself regardless,"" and ""I just wish I could die in my sleep instead"" clearly express a desire to die.

According to the hierarchy rule, if a post contains elements of multiple categories, it must be classified as the highest risk category present. Since the post explicitly describes past actions that qualify as attempts or NSSI (""I've done it many times,"" ""if I start cutting again""), the highest risk category is Attempt. Even though there is current ideation and a method described, the presence of past attempts takes precedence.

Like I'm feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post mentions ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all,"" which indicates suicidal ideation. However, it does not include any specific plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). Therefore, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The phrase ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all"" explicitly conveys a desire or recurring thought to end one's life. The user also states ""I'm feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing,"" which reinforces a desire to cease existing.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user does *not* explicitly reject these thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't actually want to""). They present them as ongoing thoughts they are experiencing. The general distress (""I don't know if I'm feeling too alright"") combined with these thoughts suggests they are not being actively negated.

Based on this, the post expresses an active desire to end one's life (or recurring thoughts *telling* them to do so) without a plan, which fits the definition of Ideation.

Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time.""
    *   The definition of ""Attempt"" includes ""aborted attempts (e.g., 'I put the belt around my neck but then stopped')"". The user's descriptions perfectly fit this definition. They describe concrete past actions taken with the intent to end their life, even if they stopped before completion.
    *   The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post also contains current ideation (""Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful. I am a useless piece of garbage."").
    *   Since past attempts are clearly described, this immediately places the post in the 'Attempt' category, as it is the highest risk level.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** (Not applicable, as Attempt is already identified and is higher risk).

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Not applicable, as Attempt is already identified and is higher risk, though ideation is present).

4.  **Check for Indicator:** (Not applicable, as Attempt is already identified and is higher risk).

Based on the explicit description of multiple past aborted suicide attempts, the classification is Attempt.

I might actually get the courage to do it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old."" This is a hypothetical statement about a past desire or contemplation, not a description of a past *act* of self-harm or an actual suicide attempt. So, it is not an 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post says, ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself which is the only positive thing. I might actually get the courage to do it."" While this expresses a growing intent and potential future action, it does not include any specific elements of a plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). ""Might actually get the courage to do it"" is still in the realm of contemplation, not concrete planning. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The post contains several phrases indicating a clear desire to die or end one's life:
    *   ""Living is not for me and that's okay.""
    *   ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old.""
    *   ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself which is the only positive thing.""
    *   ""I might actually get the courage to do it.""
    These explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive and to kill oneself.

4.  **Check for Indicator (Negated Thoughts/General Distress):** The user is *not* negating their suicidal thoughts; in fact, they express a growing confidence in them (""becoming more confident to kill myself which is the only positive thing""). While there is general distress, the presence of active suicidal desire elevates it beyond just 'Indicator'.

**Final Classification Decision:** The post clearly expresses an active desire to die and kill oneself, but without any concrete plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

The user post states: ""Too much. Well it finally happened I got to the point where the pain is too much and the 'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better. I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours""

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post describes future actions and intent (""will get alcohol today and be dead""), not a past completed or aborted act of self-harm or suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?**
    *   **Suicidal thoughts/desire:** Yes, ""be dead"".
    *   **Method:** Yes, ""Trazodone"" and ""alcohol"".
    *   **Timing:** Yes, ""less than 24 hours"".
    *   **Preparation:** Yes, ""I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today"".
    Since there is clear suicidal ideation combined with a specific method, timing, and preparatory actions, this fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** While there is active suicidal desire (""be dead""), the presence of a plan elevates the risk to 'Behavior'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is not negating or rejecting suicidal thoughts; rather, they are actively planning.

Based on the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is the highest risk category present.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post describes long-term struggles, negative thoughts, feelings of worthlessness, and a desire to ""give up."" It does not describe any past physical action related to self-harm or a suicide attempt.
    *   *Conclusion: Not an Attempt.*

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post states ""I want to give up"" and expresses profound feelings of worthlessness (""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives? I bring nothing to the table. Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.""). This indicates suicidal ideation.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""rope""), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my birthday""), location (e.g., ""bridge""), or preparatory actions (e.g., ""writing a note,"" ""saying goodbye"").
    *   *Conclusion: Not Behavior.*

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The phrase ""I want to give up"" directly expresses a desire to cease living or struggling against life's difficulties.
    *   The statements ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives? I bring nothing to the table. Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning"" strongly convey a desire not to be alive due to perceived worthlessness and lack of purpose. This goes beyond general distress and indicates an active desire for life to end.
    *   *Conclusion: Yes, there is active suicidal desire.*

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (before finalizing Ideation):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   The user expresses guilt (""Even typing this, I feel guilty for feeling this way""), but this guilt is about *having* these feelings, not about rejecting the desire to ""give up"" or the thoughts of worthlessness. There is no explicit negation like ""but I don't actually want to.""
    *   *Conclusion: Thoughts are not negated.*

Based on the hierarchy and analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to ""give up"" and questions the worth of their existence, which fits the definition of Ideation, as it lacks a plan but clearly expresses a desire to not be alive.

The user post expresses a clear desire to die: ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""for it to finally kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself this way,"" ""I'm going to die,"" ""I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die."" This establishes suicidal ideation.

Next, I check for a plan. The post details a specific method: ""I have anorexia and I currently weigh 90 pounds, but my new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me."" This describes using anorexia/starvation as the means to die, with specific weight targets as part of the process. This constitutes a concrete method and ongoing preparatory actions towards the stated goal of death.

Since there is active suicidal desire and a clear method/plan described, the risk level is Behavior.

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user is asking if it's possible to commit suicide using a charcoal BBQ in a tent.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post asks about a specific method (""charcoal bbq"") and a specific location (""in a tent"") for suicide. This constitutes components of a plan. While phrased as a question, it's a direct inquiry into the feasibility of a specific suicide method, implying active consideration or planning.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" and inquires about its possibility with a specific method, which clearly indicates a desire to die or active contemplation of ending one's life.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The post does not express any negation or rejection of suicidal thoughts.

Since the post contains both suicidal ideation (implied by the question about suicide) and elements of a plan (specific method and location), it falls under the 'Behavior' category according to the hierarchy. The question about the possibility of a specific method is a strong indicator of planning or active consideration of a plan.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not mention any method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to suicide. In fact, the user explicitly states, ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" Therefore, it is not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains the phrase ""everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault."" This initially suggests a desire to die. However, immediately following this, the user states, ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" This is a direct negation of an active suicidal desire. They also state, ""I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me,"" which is a passive thought about others' benefit, not an active desire to end their own life. Because the active desire is explicitly negated, it does not fit the Ideation category.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user explicitly states, ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" This directly aligns with the definition of Indicator, which includes ""posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" The user expresses significant distress, self-loathing, and thoughts about others being better off without them, but crucially negates the intent to act on suicidal thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post contains general distress, hopelessness, and explicitly negates suicidal intent, it falls into the Indicator category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, the post describes current emotional distress and suicidal thoughts, but no past actions.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? The post contains clear suicidal thoughts: ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying."" However, it does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note).

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? Yes, the phrases ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying"" are explicit expressions of a desire to die. These are not negated or rejected.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** Does the user mention suicidal thoughts but clearly reject them or state they do not want to act on them? No, the user expresses a direct desire to die, not an unwanted intrusive thought. If none of the above fit, it would default to Indicator, but Ideation clearly fits.

Based on this analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die without any concrete plan, which falls under the definition of Ideation.

The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The post states: ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around."" This sets a specific timeframe or deadline for their current situation. If it doesn't turn around, the implication is that something will happen.
    *   Later, the user uses a metaphor: ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down."" This metaphor, combined with the ""3 weeks"" deadline, strongly suggests an intention to end their life if the situation doesn't improve within that timeframe. The ""3 weeks"" acts as a timing component of a plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   The user explicitly states: ""But I can't do it anymore."" This expresses a clear inability to continue living under the current circumstances.
    *   The ""put down"" metaphor, especially in context, signifies a desire to end their life.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   There are no clear negations of suicidal thoughts. The ""3 weeks to turn around"" is a condition, not a rejection of the suicidal thought itself if the condition isn't met. The ""put down"" thought is presented as an inevitable outcome.

4.  **Default to Indicator:**
    *   This is not applicable as there are elements of both suicidal desire and a plan.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   **Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
*   **Behavior:** The post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""I can't do it anymore,"" ""put down"" metaphor) and includes a component of planning, specifically a timeframe (""3 weeks to turn around"" implying a deadline for their continued suffering/life). This fits the definition of Behavior.
*   **Ideation:** While there is ideation, the presence of a timeframe elevates it to Behavior.
*   **Indicator:** This is too low, as there is active suicidal desire and a plan component.

Based on the presence of both active suicidal desire and a specific timeframe (a component of a plan), the highest risk category is Behavior.

Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community.

And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the social media post. I will follow the provided hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes ""plotting"" and ""drafted my will,"" which are preparatory actions, but not a physical act of self-harm or an aborted attempt. Therefore, it is not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior:** This category requires *both* suicidal ideation *and* a component of planning.
    *   **Planning:** The post clearly describes planning: ""I have been 'plotting' my suicide seriously on and off for months,"" and ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" These are concrete preparatory actions.
    *   **Ideation:** The post mentions ""the thought of suicide feel like an obligation."" However, the user explicitly states: ""Today, I feel better. I am out of my hole for now. I.I don't think I would do 'it'."" They also state, ""please don't worry."" This strong negation of current intent means there isn't *active* suicidal ideation *currently* combined with planning. The planning described is in the past (""on and off for months,"" ""Yesterday"").

    Because the current intent is negated, and the planning is described as past, it does not fit the criteria for ""Behavior"" as a current risk.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** This category requires an explicit desire to no longer be alive or to die, without a plan. The user explicitly negates this desire: ""I don't think I would do 'it'."" and ""I am out of my hole for now."" Therefore, it is not ""Ideation.""

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This category applies if none of the above fit, or if the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them.
    *   The post discusses suicide thematically (""thought of suicide feel like an obligation"").
    *   It expresses general distress and hopelessness (""I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I just can't 'click' into life."").
    *   Crucially, the user mentions suicidal thoughts and past planning but *clearly rejects* acting on them currently: ""I don't think I would do 'it',"" ""I am out of my hole for now,"" and ""please don't worry."" This aligns perfectly with the ""Crucial Rule"" for Indicator: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them (e.g., intrusive or unwanted thoughts)."" The ""obligation"" phrasing also suggests an intrusive thought pattern.

Based on the explicit negation of current intent, despite the detailed description of past planning, the post falls into the ""Indicator"" category. The user is discussing their experience with suicidal thoughts and past behaviors, but currently stating they are not at risk of acting on them.

150,"i hate tough love. i know someone and i'll call them Z. today Z started mocking me when i was stressed and told him i feel like he would be better off without me. Z is in contact with my ex who I am not on good terms with. in the middle of this conversation when i am not in a good mood, he starts revealing my messages to my ex and has him respond through Z's account. i wasn't aware until the conversation was over and Z told me. he knows this brings me anxiety and i have told him this many times, only for him to ""forget"". except this time he was aware and brought this up right before he told me. and this shit is ok because of ""tough love""? if i wanted to be criticized and mocked for feeling depressed i'd talk to my fucking mother. i am so sick of this endless myopic bouts of ""criticism"" when i have said time and time again that it doesn't fucking help. i get abused enough at home and i don't need this shit among my friends. i want it to stop and if i leave them i have no one.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post expresses significant distress and feelings of being a burden (""i feel like he would be better off without me""), but it does not include any concrete plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) for ending their life. The phrase ""i want it to stop"" refers to the abuse and criticism, not life itself.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die?
    *   The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is concerning and suggests low self-worth, which can be a precursor to ideation. However, it is not a direct, active statement like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" It's a thought about *others* being better off, rather than a personal desire to end their own life.
    *   The primary focus of the post is on the emotional abuse and distress caused by their friend and home life, and a feeling of being trapped (""if i leave them i have no one"").
    *   There is no explicit statement of wanting to die or end their life.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts:** The post does not mention suicidal thoughts that the user rejects.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since no attempt, behavior, or explicit ideation is present, the post falls into the Indicator category. It clearly shows general distress, hopelessness (""if i leave them i have no one""), and mental health struggles (""stressed,"" ""feeling depressed,"" ""anxiety""). The statement ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is a strong sign of distress and potential suicidal ideation, but without a direct desire to die, it remains an indicator of risk.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes intense emotional pain, anger, and exhaustion related to past trauma and current struggles (""she has sucked my soul out dry,"" ""how can you do those sorts of things to a child""). However, there is no mention of a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt, aborted or otherwise.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan?
    *   Does it express suicidal thoughts? The post conveys extreme fatigue (""i'm so tired,"" ""no more energy to deal with this anymore"") and a sense of hopelessness about the world (""the world is just fucked in every single way""). It also contains a highly ambiguous phrase directed at someone else: ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally."" This hints at a desire for an end to suffering, but it's projected onto another person's non-existence, not a direct statement of the user's own desire to die. It does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or similar.
    *   Is there a plan? No method, timing, location, or preparatory actions are mentioned.
    *   Therefore, it does not fit the Behavior criteria.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? While the post is filled with despair and exhaustion, it does not contain explicit statements like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I'm going to end it all."" The exhaustion is about dealing with life's difficulties, not a direct desire for self-annihilation. The closest phrase (""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally"") is too indirect and focused on another person to be classified as the user's own active suicidal ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts:** There are no explicit suicidal thoughts mentioned that are then negated by the user.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post does not describe an attempt, a plan, or explicit personal suicidal ideation, it falls into the category of general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles. The user expresses profound exhaustion, anger, and despair about their life circumstances and the state of the world. This is consistent with the Indicator definition.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation for suicide.
    *   The post states, ""I don't want to kill myself, but."" This immediately indicates a negation of suicidal intent.
    *   There are no details about a method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., tonight, on my birthday), location (e.g., bridge), or preparation (e.g., writing a note).
    *   Therefore, this is not a Behavior-level post.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post begins with ""I don't want to kill myself."" This is a direct negation of suicidal desire.
    *   While the user expresses deep distress (""literally nothing going for me,"" ""sick of _this_ life,"" ""nothing is going to change,"" ""walls are closing in and there's no escape""), they also state, ""I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life,"" and ""I really want to give life a chance. I want to have financial independence, a girlfriend, hobbies, and see where it takes me.""
    *   There is no phrase like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to end it all,"" or ""I wish I were dead."" The distress is about the current circumstances and lack of progress, not a desire for life to cease.
    *   Therefore, this is not an Ideation-level post.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I don't want to kill myself."" This is a clear rejection of suicidal intent, even though the user is experiencing significant hopelessness and distress about their life situation. This aligns directly with the ""Crucial Rule"" for Indicator: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.""

4.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles (""nothing going for me,"" ""sick of this,"" ""walls are closing in""). Crucially, it explicitly negates a desire to die. This fits the definition of Indicator.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses profound distress and hopelessness but explicitly negates suicidal intent, stating ""I don't want to kill myself"" and expressing a desire to ""give life a chance."" This aligns with the definition and crucial rule for the Indicator category.

I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   No, the post discusses current feelings and future thoughts/intentions, not a completed or aborted past action.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post states: ""I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family"".
    *   ""I want to die"" is clear suicidal ideation.
    *   ""tomorrow"" specifies a timing.
    *   ""while my mom is out with family"" specifies a circumstance/timing, which can be considered a form of planning for the act.
    *   The presence of both clear ideation and a specific timing/circumstance constitutes a plan.
    *   Although the user also states ""but I know I shouldn't"" and ""I just am too weak and pathetic to do it"", the explicit mention of a desire to die *with a specific timeframe* (""tomorrow"") and *circumstance* (""while my mom is out"") elevates this to Behavior. The hierarchy rule states that if multiple categories are present, classify as the highest risk. The presence of a plan overrides the internal conflict or stated weakness.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is skipped because a plan has been identified, meaning the risk is higher than Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is for posts that might otherwise be Ideation but are negated. Here, a plan is present, so the negation (""I know I shouldn't,"" ""too weak"") does not reduce the classification from Behavior. The plan is clearly articulated despite the internal conflict.

Based on the presence of suicidal ideation (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself"") and a specific timing/circumstance (""tomorrow while my mom is out with family""), the post fits the criteria for Behavior.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. The phrase ""yeet myself"" is expressed as a desire (""I just want to...""), not a past action.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a desire to ""yeet myself,"" which is slang for ending one's life. While ""yeet myself"" could imply a method (throwing oneself), it is presented as a strong urge or desire (""I just want to... way too much"") rather than a concrete plan. There is no mention of specific timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post states ""my good days make me realize how useless life is,"" ""I'm still dead inside,"" ""I must be beyond saving,"" and most directly, ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much."" The phrase ""yeet myself"" in this context clearly indicates a desire to end one's life or die. This is an explicit expression of a desire to no longer be alive.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing their own strong desire (""I just want to... yeet myself""), not a thought they are rejecting or do not agree with.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I just want to... yeet myself"") but lacks any concrete plan (method, timing, location, preparation). This fits the definition of Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I tried to end it once before."" This describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. The definition for 'Attempt' is: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt."" This directly matches the statement. The hierarchy rule also states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post clearly mentions a past attempt and also current ideation (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"").

Since a past attempt is present, according to the hierarchy, this is the highest risk category. I do not need to check for Behavior, Ideation, or Indicator as 'Attempt' takes precedence.

The user post is ""Can I please ! Talk to someone ? I'm having a bad panic attack. 18 and over please I just wanna kill myself out of fear"".

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for suicide. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior based on a plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states, ""I just wanna kill myself"". This is a clear and direct expression of a desire to end one's life. This fits the definition of Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user states ""I just wanna kill myself out of fear."" While the desire is linked to fear, it is not negated or rejected (e.g., ""but I don't actually want to""). The desire is actively expressed. Therefore, it is not an Indicator due to negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not applicable as an active suicidal desire (Ideation) has been identified.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt or self-harm is described.
*   **Behavior:** No plan is present.
*   **Ideation:** The phrase ""I just wanna kill myself"" clearly indicates an active desire to die without a plan. This is the highest risk level present.
*   **Indicator:** The desire is explicit and not negated, so it's more severe than an Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die without a concrete plan, placing it in the Ideation category.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post contains phrases like ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"", which imply ending life. However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with"" strongly conveys a desire to end the struggle/life. The rhetorical question ""why keep going?"" further reinforces this sentiment of not wanting to continue living. This goes beyond general distress and expresses a direct desire to cease existing.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** While the thought is attributed to ""my brain screaming,"" the user does not explicitly negate or reject this thought (e.g., ""but I don't want to""). Instead, the subsequent sentences (""I feel more and more defeated. I'll never be out of this torture cycle, so why keep going?"") suggest a leaning towards giving in to that thought, rather than fighting against it as an unwanted intrusion. Therefore, it is not an Indicator due to negated thoughts.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to end one's life without a plan, fitting the definition of Ideation.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but does not include any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states, ""This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts."" This is a direct expression of having thoughts about ending one's life, indicating a personal, active desire or contemplation. This fits the definition of Ideation, as it expresses a desire to no longer be alive (through ""suicidal thoughts"") without a concrete plan.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user states ""I currently have suicidal thoughts"" without any negation or indication that these thoughts are unwanted or intrusive (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). Therefore, it is not an Indicator based on negation.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post fits the criteria for Ideation, it does not default to Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" without a plan or negation places it in the Ideation category.

159,Anyone here genuinely upset that they are planning to commit suicide?. My life won't ever be the same again and I can't change my circumstances that much so far. I'll never be happy if I continue to live but I'm angry also because if it weren't for my situation I would be happy to continue living. So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post begins with a question: ""Anyone here genuinely upset that they are planning to commit suicide?"". While phrased as a question to others, the subsequent sentences reveal the user's own state of mind.
""My life won't ever be the same again... I'll never be happy if I continue to live... So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go."" This clearly expresses a desire to end their life (""I have to go"").
""But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams."" This reinforces the intent to ""go"" (die).
""Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it?"" This further solidifies the user's personal feeling of having ""no choice but to end it.""

Now, applying the thinking process:

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""planning to commit suicide"" in the opening question, which, in context with the rest of the post, refers to the user's own situation.
    *   The phrases ""I have to go"" and ""have no choice but to end it"" indicate a firm decision or intent to act, moving beyond passive ideation. While no specific method, timing, or location is provided, the *concept* of planning and the stated necessity to act are present. According to the definition, ""A plan can be a method, a specific timeframe, a location, or a preparatory act. The presence of any of these, even if vague, elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior."" The explicit mention of ""planning"" and the strong sense of ""having to go"" or ""end it"" suggests a component of planning, even if the details are absent. This is similar to the example ""i plan to kill myself at 21,"" which is classified as Behavior due to the stated intention to plan, even without immediate details.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   Yes, phrases like ""I'll never be happy if I continue to live,"" ""I have to go,"" and ""have no choice but to end it"" clearly express a desire to not be alive. This meets the criteria for Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   No, the user is not rejecting these thoughts; they are expressing them as their current reality and perceived necessity.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as Ideation and elements of Behavior are present.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:**
The post contains clear Ideation. Furthermore, the explicit mention of ""planning to commit suicide"" and the strong statements of ""I have to go"" and ""have no choice but to end it"" elevate the risk to Behavior. The user is not just wishing to die but expressing a perceived necessity and decision to act, which falls under the planning component of Behavior, even without specific details of the plan.

I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post needs to be classified based on the suicide risk hierarchy. I will go through the steps:

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: The post mentions ""going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide,"" but these refer to a past state or a past alternative, not a current plan for a future act. There are no details of method, timing, location, or preparation for a *current* suicidal act.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The post does not contain phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I'm going to die soon"" that express a *current* active desire to die. The distress is related to regretting opening up and dreading moving back home.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The post does not express suicidal thoughts that are then rejected.

4.  **Check for Attempt**: The post states, ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide."" The definition of ""Attempt"" includes ""aborted attempts (e.g., 'I put the belt around my neck but then stopped')."" While the user doesn't describe the specific physical actions of an aborted attempt, the phrase ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" strongly implies being at the very brink of initiating an attempt, and that telling the mother was the *alternative* to ""going through with attempting suicide."" This indicates a past, very proximate, or nearly initiated suicidal act. This falls under the severity of an ""Attempt"" as it describes a past action/state of being on the verge of an attempt.

According to the hierarchy, if a post contains elements of multiple categories, I must classify it as the highest risk category present. The description of being ""so close to attempting suicide"" and that it was an alternative to ""going through with attempting suicide"" points to a past, near-attempt experience, which falls under the 'Attempt' category.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not express any suicidal thoughts combined with a plan (method, timing, location, preparation). In fact, it explicitly negates suicidal intent.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post does not express a desire to no longer be alive or to die. On the contrary, it states, ""I wont kill myself of course.""
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The post describes severe distress (""I cant take it,"" ""pain makes me want to scream,"" ""Its excruciating"") but immediately follows it with a clear negation of suicidal intent: ""I wont kill myself of course."" This fits the definition of Indicator, specifically the crucial rule for this category: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" While not explicitly stating ""my brain tells me to,"" the user is expressing intense pain but rejecting suicide as an action.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since no higher risk categories apply, and the post expresses general distress while explicitly negating suicidal intent, it falls into the Indicator category.

162,I wish I could stop obsessing over appearance. All the females around me want to become prettier which has only intensified my gender dysphoria. I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing. I want to be a male now.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not express any suicidal thoughts or mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) related to ending one's life. It discusses gender dysphoria and appearance.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post does not express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life. Phrases like ""I wish I could stop obsessing,"" ""intensified my gender dysphoria,"" ""I hate wearing makeup,"" and ""I want to be a male now"" indicate distress related to gender identity and appearance, but not suicidal intent.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** There are no suicidal thoughts expressed, so this specific check (for negated suicidal thoughts) is not applicable.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post does not fit Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation, and it expresses general distress, hopelessness (implied by ""I wish I could stop obsessing"" and the intensity of dysphoria), and mental health struggles (gender dysphoria), it falls into the Indicator category. It highlights significant emotional pain and struggle but without a stated desire to die.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the established hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post mentions ""I wish I had the courage to end it all,"" which is ideation, but there is no mention of a specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The phrase ""I wish I had the courage to end it all"" initially suggests Ideation, as it expresses a desire to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** This is a critical step. Immediately after stating ""I wish I had the courage to end it all,"" the user writes, ""And yet. I just want the courage to endure it all."" This directly negates the desire to end it all, expressing a counter-desire to live and endure. The rest of the post reinforces this by offering support and hope to others (""you aren't alone,"" ""things get better,"" ""here I stay. waiting,"" ""you are loved, you are seen,"" ""Stay around to see these days""). This clear rejection or counter-desire to the suicidal thought aligns perfectly with the definition of Indicator, which includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.

Based on the explicit negation of the suicidal thought and the subsequent message of enduring and supporting others, the post falls into the Indicator category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:**
    *   The post states: ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"".
    *   The definition of ""Attempt"" includes: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts (e.g., 'I put the belt around my neck but then stopped').""
    *   The phrase ""almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" strongly indicates an aborted attempt. The intent was there, and the action was only prevented by the lack of means. This fits the criteria for an aborted attempt.
    *   The post also contains current ideation (""if my friends didn't exist i probably wouldn't be alive right now"" and ""yet i still consider"").
    *   The Hierarchy Rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""

Since a past aborted attempt is clearly described, regardless of other elements, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

165,suicide with me. can anyone suicide with me together. for those want to suicide too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post is ""suicide with me. can anyone suicide with me together. for those want to suicide too"".

1.  **Check for an Attempt**: The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not ""Attempt"".

2.  **Check for Behavior**: Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""suicide with me,"" ""want to suicide too"").
    *   Does it include a plan? The phrase ""suicide with me together"" implies a shared act, but it does not specify a method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., tonight, tomorrow), location (e.g., a specific place), or preparation (e.g., writing a note). The request is for *company* in the act, not a concrete plan *for the act itself*. Without a specific method, timing, location, or preparatory act for the user's own suicide, it does not meet the criteria for ""Behavior"" as defined.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? Yes, ""suicide with me"" and ""for those want to suicide too"" are very direct and active expressions of a desire to die and to engage in suicide. It goes beyond general sadness.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want? No, the user is actively soliciting others to join them in suicide, indicating a clear desire.

5.  **Default to Indicator**: This post is clearly not just general distress or hopelessness.

**Conclusion**: The post expresses a clear, active desire to die (""suicide with me"") but lacks any concrete plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) as defined for the ""Behavior"" category. Therefore, it falls under ""Ideation"".

I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself.

The user post needs to be classified based on the suicide risk hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready."" This describes a past act of self-harm, specifically an aborted attempt. According to the definition, ""Attempt: The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts...""

2.  **Apply Hierarchy Rule:** The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""
    *   The post clearly describes a past aborted attempt.
    *   It also contains strong current ideation (""I want to kms,"" ""I really want to hang myself right now,"" ""I can't stop thinking about killing myself,"" ""I can't focus on anything except trying again,"" ""I don't feel like I can wait any longer"").
    *   Even though there are elements of current ideation and potential planning (mentioning the rope, wanting to hang themselves *right now*), the presence of the *past aborted attempt* elevates the classification to ""Attempt"" due to the hierarchy rule.

Therefore, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead.

He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job. I've pushed my fiancé away I guess if he didn't even bother to do this for me, to care that I haven't stopped crying. I just want to fucking die.

The user is expressing a very strong, immediate intent to die: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""It's finally fucking time,"" ""I just want to fucking die."" This clearly indicates active suicidal desire.

Next, I need to check for a plan. The user states, ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" While they express uncertainty about the *exact* execution, they explicitly mention a *method* (""get a gun"") that they have considered. This pre-existing thought about a specific method, even if not fully solidified or acted upon yet, constitutes a component of planning according to the guidelines (mentioning tools/weapons).

Since there is clear suicidal ideation and a component of a plan (a method), the classification is Behavior.
It is not an Attempt as no past action is described.
It is stronger than Ideation due to the mention of a method.
It is not an Indicator as the thoughts are not negated and there is active desire and a plan component.

There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This describes a past action (""just finished driving"") taken with explicit suicidal intent (""full intentions to end things""). The act of driving to a specific location with the intent to end one's life constitutes a preparatory act for an attempt, and it aligns with the definition of an ""aborted attempt"" as an action initiated with suicidal intent, even if not fully carried out. The example ""I put a belt around my neck... but then stopped"" is classified as 'attempt' because an action was initiated. Driving to a specific location with ""full intentions to end things"" is an initiated action with clear suicidal intent.

2.  **Hierarchy Rule:** The rule states: ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories (e.g., a past attempt and current plans), you must classify it as the highest risk category present."" Even though the user later says ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" (which might suggest a negation or current lack of plan), the *past action* with *full intentions* described (""just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"") is a clear indicator of an aborted attempt, which falls under the 'Attempt' category.

Since the post describes a past action taken with suicidal intent (an aborted attempt), it falls into the 'Attempt' category, which is the highest risk level.

The user post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm ready to die"").
It also mentions a specific timing (""The date was set a while ago"") and preparatory actions (""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"").
According to the guidelines, if suicidal thoughts and any element of a plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) are present, the category is Behavior.
This post contains both active suicidal desire and components of a plan (timing and preparation).
It does not describe a past attempt.
It does not negate the suicidal thoughts.
Therefore, the highest risk category is Behavior.

I still sleep in class but my teachers now dont care much which i guess is good.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post states ""Im thinking of ending my life."" This expresses suicidal thoughts. Now, I need to check for a plan (method, timing, location, preparation). The post details various life struggles (grades, OCD, school, friends, course) but does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., tonight, at 21), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye). Therefore, it does not fit the Behavior criteria.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post explicitly states, ""Im thinking of ending my life."" This is a direct and active expression of a desire to end one's life. It goes beyond general distress and indicates a personal, active desire.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user states ""Im thinking of ending my life"" without any negation or rejection of this thought. They do not say ""My brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to."" Therefore, it is not an Indicator due to negated thoughts.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as a higher category (Ideation) has been identified.

Based on the hierarchy, the highest risk category present is Ideation because there is a clear expression of a desire to end one's life, but no concrete plan is mentioned.

171,its working!. hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post is ""its working!. hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up"".

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The phrase ""its working!"" strongly implies that an action has been initiated and is currently in progress, leading towards the desired outcome of death (""pls let me never wake up""). While the definition of ""Attempt"" specifies ""past act,"" the context of ""its working!"" in conjunction with the desire to die indicates an ongoing or just-initiated suicidal act. This represents the most immediate and severe risk, akin to an attempt in progress.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** If it were not an attempt, I would check for a plan. The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation (""hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up""). The phrase ""its working!"" implies a method is being employed or has just been initiated. This goes beyond mere planning; it signifies the *execution* of a plan.

3.  **Hierarchy Application:** The hierarchy is Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator. Since ""its working!"" implies an active, ongoing suicidal act, it represents the highest level of immediate danger, which aligns with the intent of the ""Attempt"" category, even if the act is not yet ""past"" or completed. It's an attempt currently underway.

Therefore, the post indicates an ongoing suicide attempt.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a completed/aborted suicide attempt. It mentions past *statements* about doing it (""saying im gonna do it but then i never do""), but not past *actions*. So, it's not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** The user clearly expresses a desire to die (""im so ready to die"", ""tonight im gonna do it"").
    *   **Method:** The user explicitly mentions ""42 unnamed pills"" and ""some allergy medicine"" as means.
    *   **Timing:** The user states ""tonight im gonna do it"".
    *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:** The user notes the pills are ""really small so its easy to swallow"" and ""also very small for easy swallowing,"" indicating consideration of the method's ease of use.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation combined with a specific method and timing, this fits the criteria for Behavior.

3.  **Hierarchy Rule:** Since Behavior was identified, and it is a higher risk than Ideation or Indicator, the classification will be Behavior.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes feelings of tiredness, loneliness, mental illness struggles, and a desire to ""be done"" and ""kill myself."" However, it does not describe any *past act* of self-harm or a suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not an Attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""I want to be done and kill myself""). Now, I need to check if there is any element of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation).
    *   Method: No specific method is mentioned (e.g., ""pills,"" ""rope"").
    *   Timing: No specific time is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
    *   Location: No specific location is mentioned (e.g., ""bridge"").
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are mentioned (e.g., ""writing a note,"" ""saying goodbye"").
    *   The phrase ""More and more often it feels like the only way... would be to just be done and kill myself"" indicates a growing thought or conviction, but not a concrete plan.
    *   Since there is no plan component, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The post clearly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die. Phrases like ""I want to be done with everything"" and ""the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself"" explicitly convey this desire. The user is actively contemplating or wishing for death as a solution.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a personal desire/conclusion (""it feels like the only way... would be to just be done and kill myself""). They are *not* stating that these are intrusive thoughts they don't agree with or want to act on (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). Therefore, it is not an Indicator based on negated thoughts.

Based on the hierarchy, since there is a clear, active desire to die without a concrete plan, the classification is Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the four-step thinking process and then select the appropriate category.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   Method: The post says ""I really want to check out"" but doesn't mention *how* (e.g., pills, rope).
    *   Timing: No specific time is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
    *   Location: No specific place is mentioned.
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are described (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    *   Conclusion: There is no element of a plan present. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to die or not be alive.
    *   The phrases ""I really want to check out"" and ""how much I want to check out"" are clear and direct expressions of a desire to end one's life. The user also states they have no ""moral problem with suicide at this point"" and don't ""even care about what me unexpectedly checking out would do to the other in my life,"" which further emphasizes the active desire.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear and active suicidal desire. This points towards 'Ideation'.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The user is expressing their *own* desire to ""check out,"" not describing intrusive thoughts they are rejecting. They are stating their personal intent and desire.
    *   Conclusion: The thoughts are not negated. This is not an 'Indicator' based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post clearly fits 'Ideation' due to active suicidal desire, it does not default to 'Indicator'.

**Final Classification Decision:**
Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I really want to check out"") but does not include any concrete plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'. It does not describe a past attempt, nor does it contain a plan to qualify as 'Behavior'. It is more severe than a general 'Indicator' because it expresses a direct desire to die, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, phrases like ""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im going to do it,"" ""im done,"" and ""im in so much pain and i cant handle it anymore"" clearly express a desire to end one's life. ""Im going to do it"" is a direct statement of intent.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? The phrase ""thank you to the people i met thru this sub. and i hope everyone finds something to live for."" functions as a farewell message, which is explicitly listed as a ""preparatory action"" under the definition of a plan.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation (""im going to do it,"" ""im done"") and a preparatory act (farewell message), this fits the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** While there is active suicidal desire, the presence of a preparatory action elevates it beyond just Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The thoughts are not negated; they are expressed as current intent.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of both suicidal ideation and a preparatory act (farewell) classifies this as Behavior.

The user is asking for a classification of the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the specified hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, the user is asking a question about a future action.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan?
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""kill myself,"" ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""why not.""
    *   It then asks: ""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"". This is a direct inquiry about a *method*. Actively seeking information about a method for suicide constitutes a component of planning, as it's a preparatory action.
    *   Therefore, the post contains both suicidal ideation and a component of planning (seeking a method). This fits the definition of Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is skipped because a plan element was identified, elevating it beyond Ideation. However, for completeness, the post clearly expresses a desire to die (""kill myself"").

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk elements are present.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of suicidal ideation combined with actively seeking a method (a component of planning) classifies this post as Behavior.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post, focusing solely on the risk of the person *writing* the post.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt by the author?
    *   No. The author is discussing overdosing in general terms, not describing a personal past attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post include suicidal ideation *and* a component of planning by the author?
    *   No. The author is not expressing any personal suicidal ideation. They are providing information about the consequences of overdosing to others.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die by the author?
    *   No. The author is not saying ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead."" They are educating readers about the realities of overdose.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** Does the post show general distress, hopelessness, or discuss suicide thematically but lack a personal, active desire to die? Does it include suicidal thoughts that the user rejects?
    *   The post *discusses suicide thematically* by detailing the unpleasant and often non-fatal outcomes of overdosing.
    *   It *lacks a personal, active desire to die* from the author. The author is clearly writing from a position of warning others, not expressing personal suicidal intent.
    *   It does not express personal distress or hopelessness, nor does it mention suicidal thoughts that the author rejects. However, the definition of Indicator also covers posts that ""discusses suicide thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die."" This post fits this aspect perfectly. The author is not at personal risk, but the topic is suicide.

Given that the classification must reflect the risk of the *person writing the post*, and the author is clearly not expressing personal suicidal intent, the lowest risk category that acknowledges the thematic discussion of suicide is ""Indicator."" The post is a preventative message, not a cry for help.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post. I will follow the provided thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** Yes, ""i truly have no motivation to keep on living"", ""im positive im gonna do it the the future"". This clearly indicates active suicidal desire.
    *   **Plan component:**
        *   Method: Not explicitly mentioned.
        *   Timing: ""in the future"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this"". This is a conditional future timing. The example ""i plan to kill myself at 21"" was classified as Behavior due to a future timeframe. ""when im fed up of this"" serves as a specific condition for the timing of the act.
        *   Location: Not mentioned.
        *   Preparation: Not mentioned.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and a component of timing (a future, conditional timing), this fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The phrase ""im positive im gonna do it the the future"" combined with ""ill do it when im fed up of this"" indicates a future intent with a condition for its execution.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a desire to no longer be alive (""no motivation to keep on living,"" ""positive im gonna do it""). This would fit 'Ideation' if there were no plan component. However, because a plan component (timing) is present, 'Behavior' is a higher risk category.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is expressing active suicidal intent and a future conditional plan, not merely general distress or rejected intrusive thoughts. The phrase ""dont worry, im good rn"" refers to their current state, but does not negate the stated future intent and plan.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:** The post contains elements of Ideation and Behavior. According to the hierarchy rule, I must classify it as the highest risk category present, which is 'Behavior'.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   No, the post does not describe any past or aborted attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post expresses extreme distress and resentment (""I fucking hate my parents,"" ""psychologically tortured""). However, it does not express any suicidal thoughts or a desire to die, nor does it mention any plan.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The post clearly conveys profound suffering and unhappiness with life (""living a life psychologically tortured""). However, it *does not* contain phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I want to end it all,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" It expresses the pain of living, but not a direct desire for death.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   No suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned for the user to negate.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post fits this description perfectly. It shows significant general distress, hopelessness about their life's circumstances, and describes severe mental health struggles (""psychologically tortured""). It lacks any direct expression of suicidal intent or desire to die.

There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the established hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post describes a terrifying dream and the resulting panic/anxiety. There is no mention of any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
    *   Conclusion: Not ""Attempt"".

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post describes a dream and the user's emotional reaction (panic, terror, anxiety about sleeping). There are no suicidal thoughts or any elements of a plan to end one's life.
    *   Conclusion: Not ""Behavior"".

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The post contains phrases like ""severe panic attack,"" ""absolutely terrified me,"" ""sheer panic,"" and ""anxious to sleep."" These indicate significant distress and anxiety.
    *   However, there are no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I hate living,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" The distress is related to the dream and its impact on sleep, not a desire to end life.
    *   Conclusion: Not ""Ideation"".

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Does the user mention suicidal thoughts but clearly reject them?
    *   The post does not mention any suicidal thoughts, so this specific condition for ""Indicator"" (negated thoughts) is not met.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly describes ""general distress"" (""severe panic attack,"" ""terrified,"" ""anxious to sleep"") and ""mental health struggles"" (anxiety impacting sleep). It lacks any suicidal content. This aligns perfectly with the definition of ""Indicator.""

Therefore, the post falls into the ""Indicator"" category as it expresses general distress and mental health struggles without any suicidal ideation, plans, or attempts.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post says ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" and ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering."" While this expresses a desire to act, it does not specify a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for a *current* plan. So, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior based on a *current* plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrases ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" and ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" clearly indicate a desire to end their life. This points towards Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting the suicidal thoughts; rather, they are seeking a reason/strength to act on them. Therefore, it is not an Indicator based on negation.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as active suicidal desire is present.

5.  **Hierarchy Rule Check (Attempt):** The post explicitly states, ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" The phrase ""once on purpose"" describes a past suicide attempt. According to the ""Hierarchy Rule: If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Since a past attempt is mentioned, and there is current ideation, the highest risk category is Attempt.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I'm suicidal again"" but does not mention any method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states ""all of a sudden I'm suicidal again."" This is a clear and direct expression of a desire to not be alive or to die.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user states ""I'm suicidal again"" without any indication that these are unwanted or rejected thoughts (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). The statement implies a return to a state of being suicidal.
4.  **Hierarchy Rule:** Since there is a clear expression of active suicidal desire (""I'm suicidal again"") but no plan or past attempt, the highest risk category present is Ideation.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post clearly states ""now I want to die more than ever"" and ""I can't have this life it's too painful."" This is a direct and active expression of a desire to not be alive or to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want. They are expressing a direct desire to die.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user's post contains several key elements:
1.  **""Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?""**: This indicates active consideration of suicide and a specific method.
2.  **""ive alr tied the noose""**: This is a concrete preparatory action. Tying a noose is a direct step towards attempting suicide by hanging. This clearly fulfills the ""Preparation"" criteria for a plan.
3.  **""although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.""**: While there is hesitation (""still not sure""), this does not negate the suicidal intent or the preparatory action. The user is seeking information to inform their decision, not rejecting the idea. This is not an intrusive thought they are trying to fight off.

Applying the hierarchy:
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt is described.
*   **Behavior:** The post explicitly mentions a method (""suicide by hanging"") and a preparatory action (""tied the noose""). This constitutes a plan. The presence of a plan, even with hesitation, elevates the risk to Behavior.
*   **Ideation:** While there's an implied desire to die, the presence of a plan moves it beyond mere ideation.
*   **Indicator:** The user is not rejecting suicidal thoughts; they are actively preparing and seeking information about the act.

Therefore, the presence of a specific method and a preparatory action (""tied the noose"") classifies this as Behavior.

The user post is: ""I'm a pervert. Should I kill myself? I've never done anything wrong or illegal. I'm just a pervert. I can't help my sexual feelings. I want to die because of them.""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for mentions of method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   Method: None mentioned.
    *   Timing: None mentioned.
    *   Location: None mentioned.
    *   Preparation: None mentioned.
    *   Since no elements of a plan are present, the post is not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for phrases expressing a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post contains ""Should I kill myself?"" which is a question about suicide, and more definitively, ""I want to die because of them.""
    *   ""I want to die"" is a clear, active expression of suicidal desire.
    *   This indicates the post is likely Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   While ""Should I kill myself?"" is a question, the subsequent statement ""I want to die because of them"" is a direct affirmation of that desire, not a negation. There is no indication that these are intrusive or unwanted thoughts that the user is rejecting.
    *   Therefore, this is not an Indicator based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is only applied if none of the above categories fit. Since active suicidal desire (Ideation) was identified, this step is not applicable.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:**
*   No Attempt elements are present.
*   No Behavior (plan) elements are present.
*   Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation) is clearly present (""I want to die"").
*   The thoughts are not negated, so it's not Indicator.

Based on the hierarchy and definitions, the presence of a clear desire to die without a plan places it in the Ideation category.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post expresses a desire to ""end it"", but it does not include any specific plan elements (method, timing, location, preparation). Therefore, it's not 'behavior'.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" explicitly expresses a desire to end one's life. This fits the definition of 'ideation'.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a direct desire (""i just wanna end it""), not a thought they are rejecting or do not agree with. Thus, it's not 'indicator' based on negation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt**: The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It talks about past difficult situations where the user ""felt like I couldn't cope"" and found an alternative, but not an attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior**: The post does not express current suicidal thoughts with any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation). The user is discussing an *alternative* to suicide, not planning one.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The user states, ""I just want to point out the alternative for anyone on the brink of suicide."" and ""the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again."" The user explicitly states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment"". There is no current expressed desire to die, to not be alive, or to end one's life. Instead, the post is about finding a way *out* of feeling suicidal or unable to cope.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The post discusses suicide thematically (""anyone on the brink of suicide"") and past distress (""felt like I couldn't cope""). However, it *does not* express suicidal thoughts that the user rejects (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). Instead, it offers a coping mechanism *as an alternative to* suicide. The user is reflecting on past struggles and a successful coping strategy, and offering it to others. The overall tone is one of having found a solution to past distress and sharing it, not current active suicidal ideation or even intrusive thoughts.

5.  **Default to Indicator**: Since none of the higher risk categories (Attempt, Behavior, Ideation) apply, and the post discusses suicide thematically (""anyone on the brink of suicide"") and general distress (past times of not coping) without a current personal desire to die, it fits the definition of Indicator. The user is currently functional and is discussing a coping mechanism for past or potential future distress, rather than expressing current suicidal intent.

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post describes current feelings and future intent (""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it""), not a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, not Attempt.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, phrases like ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""then end it"" clearly indicate a desire to die.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Timing:** ""tonight"" is explicitly stated, indicating a specific timeframe.
        *   **Location:** ""in my basement"" is a specific location.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" suggests a preparatory state, and ""I love you all so much 💛"" sounds like a farewell.
    *   Because there is clear suicidal ideation combined with specific timing (""tonight""), a specific location (""in my basement""), and preparatory/farewell language, this fits the criteria for **Behavior**.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** This is present, but the presence of a plan elevates it to Behavior.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is not negating suicidal thoughts; they are expressing a clear intent to act.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of suicidal ideation with a clear plan (timing, location, and preparatory actions) classifies this as Behavior.

189,"I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen. Will I be able to successfully end my life? I'm fairly short, male and 56 kg.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user's post explicitly asks ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" which demonstrates clear suicidal ideation.
The post also mentions specific substances: ""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen."" This constitutes a clear method for a potential suicide act.
According to the classification rules, if a post includes both suicidal ideation and a component of planning (such as a method), it should be classified as Behavior.
The presence of a specific method elevates the risk beyond mere ideation.
It is not an ""Attempt"" as it describes a potential future action, not a past one.
It is not ""Ideation"" because a method is present.
It is not an ""Indicator"" as there is a clear desire to die and a method.
Therefore, the highest risk category present is Behavior.

The user post expresses extreme distress and a clear desire to no longer be alive.
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: The post does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my 21st birthday"" - though ""any other moment"" and ""another year"" express urgency, they don't constitute a concrete plan for *how* or *when* the act will occur), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The post contains multiple phrases indicating an active desire to die or not be alive:
    *   ""why shouldi live.""
    *   ""i have spent my whole life resisting the desire to end."" (explicitly mentions ""desire to end"")
    *   ""everyday i ran out ofreasons tokeep myself alive.""
    *   ""i fuckingcant do this anymore""
    *   ""i cant live like this for the rest ofmy life""
    *   ""i cant stand being here any other moment.""
    *   ""i cant imagine myslef living another year thisway""
    These phrases clearly express a desire to not be alive or to end one's life.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user is *not* expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. There is no indication that these are intrusive thoughts they are fighting against; rather, they are expressing their own profound despair and desire for an end. Therefore, it is not an Indicator due to negation.
4.  **Default to Indicator**: This is not applicable, as active suicidal desire is clearly present.

Given the presence of active suicidal desire without any concrete plan, the classification is Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post: ""SMI. How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?""

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior):** The post states ""you will probably commit suicide eventually."" While this indicates a future likelihood, it does not include any concrete plan elements like a specific method, exact timing (beyond ""eventually""), location, or preparatory actions. It's a general, long-term expectation rather than a defined plan. Therefore, it's not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The phrase ""you will probably commit suicide eventually"" expresses a personal expectation or belief that the individual will end their life. The question ""How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?"" implies that this is a personal reality or strong belief for the person writing the post, and they are grappling with how to communicate it. This is a clear expression of a desire or expectation to die by suicide, even if it's framed as a probable future event rather than an immediate intent. It goes beyond general distress.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The post does not negate or reject the suicidal thought. Instead, it asks for advice on how to communicate this perceived future reality, implying acceptance or belief in its likelihood. Therefore, it's not 'Indicator' based on negation.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   Not 'Attempt' (no past action).
*   Not 'Behavior' (no concrete plan).
*   It expresses a personal expectation/belief of suicide, which fits 'Ideation'.
*   It's more than general distress or a negated thought, so not 'Indicator'.

Based on the definitions, ""you will probably commit suicide eventually"" expresses a personal desire/expectation to die, even if future-oriented and without a specific plan. This aligns with 'Ideation'.

Will anyone read this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post mentions ""end myself"" but does not include any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post states, ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself."" This initially suggests suicidal ideation. However, I must proceed to the next step to check for negation.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Immediately after mentioning the voices telling him to ""end myself,"" the user states, ""I wanna see my daughters grow up, I can't stop crying."" This is a clear expression of a desire to live and a reason *not* to act on the suicidal thoughts. The suicidal thoughts are presented as external (""voices"") and are explicitly rejected or countered by a strong desire to live. This fits the definition of an Indicator, where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the suicidal thoughts are negated by a stated desire to live, the post falls into the Indicator category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and category definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt?** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior?** The post does not express suicidal thoughts with any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation).
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The post contains the phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"". This is not an active expression of a desire to die. Instead, it's a reflection on *not* needing to die, indicating a shift away from such thoughts. The overall tone is hopeful, focusing on finding support and being okay.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" directly fits the ""negated thoughts"" criterion. The user is acknowledging the idea of dying but is actively questioning or rejecting it, moving towards a more positive outlook (""i can be okay,"" ""i hope i can have that one day""). The post expresses general distress (""not okay right now,"" ""mental health stuff"") but clearly rejects the need to die. This aligns perfectly with the crucial rule for Indicator: ""user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.""
5.  **Default to Indicator?** Yes, because the post expresses distress and references the idea of dying, but ultimately negates that idea with a hopeful outlook.

Therefore, the post falls under the Indicator category.

The user expresses that ""suicidal thoughts are always there."" This establishes the presence of suicidal ideation.
The user then asks ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" and states ""and dont tell me not to do this bc i will do it anyway.""
This constitutes a method (Xanax pills) and a clear intent to carry out the action (""i will do it anyway""), even if the stated immediate desire is ""to be calm."" The fact that they are asking about *dying* from it, despite claiming ""i dont wanna die rn,"" directly links the action to a potential lethal outcome. This combination of suicidal thoughts, a specific method, and intent to act on it (even if the primary stated goal is not death, the inquiry about dying from it makes it relevant) elevates the risk to Behavior. It's a preparatory action (considering a method) combined with an expressed intent to carry out the action.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the social media post. I will follow the provided hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post states, ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" and ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"". These are about future actions or intentions, not a past attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** If not an attempt, does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** Yes, ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"" clearly expresses suicidal ideation.
    *   **Plan components:**
        *   **Method:** The user asks ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"". This is asking for methods of *self-harm*, not explicitly a *suicide* method, and it's a question, not a stated intent to use a specific method for suicide. The suicidal statement itself (""I can kill myself"") does not specify a method.
        *   **Timing:** ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"" implies a conditional future timing, but ""until I can"" is too vague and conditional to be considered a concrete timing like ""tonight"" or ""at 21"".
        *   **Location:** No location is mentioned.
        *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions are described.
    *   While the post contains suicidal ideation, it lacks a concrete, specific plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) for *suicide*. The question about self-harm methods is distinct from a suicide plan in the context of these definitions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** If not an attempt or behavior, does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   Yes, the statement ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"" is a direct and active expression of a desire to end one's life, even if conditional. This fits the definition of Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   No, the statement ""I will wait until I can kill myself"" is a personal declaration of intent, not a negated or unwanted thought.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** The post clearly expresses a desire to die, so it is not a default 'Indicator'.

Based on the hierarchy, the highest risk category present is 'Ideation' because there is a clear expression of a desire to die, but no concrete plan for suicide.

196,Im probably going to kill myself soon. I've been feeling a really strong urge to lately and the only people i have in my life dont care. They dont make any effort to keep me around. i just wish i wasn't even born to begin with. life is fucking stupid,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""Im probably going to kill myself soon."" While ""soon"" implies a timeframe, it is not specific enough to constitute a concrete plan element like ""tonight,"" ""at 21,"" or ""when I get home."" There is no mention of a method, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains ""Im probably going to kill myself soon"" and ""I've been feeling a really strong urge to lately,"" and ""i just wish i wasn't even born to begin with."" These phrases clearly express an active desire to die or to not be alive.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a strong urge and expectation of dying, not rejecting or negating these thoughts. The thoughts are presented as personal and active desires/feelings.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** The criteria for Ideation were met, so it does not default to Indicator.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear, active desire to die (""Im probably going to kill myself soon,"" ""strong urge"") but lacks any concrete plan elements (method, specific timing, location, or preparation). This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user is expressing a strong temptation to commit suicide by jumping from a high place.
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a temptation, not a past action. So, not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   **Method:** ""plummet to the ground"" clearly indicates a method (jumping).
    *   **Location:** ""highest floor"" specifies a location.
    *   **Timing/Preparation:** No specific timing or preparation mentioned.
    *   Since a method and location are present, this fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** ""so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" clearly expresses an active suicidal desire.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a temptation, not a thought they are rejecting. The ""if only"" clauses describe barriers to acting on the temptation (guilt, fear of consequences), but not a rejection of the temptation itself.

Based on the presence of active suicidal desire and elements of a plan (method and location), the classification is Behavior.

198,"If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he wont feel that bad if I kill myself. Any thoughts?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user post is: ""If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he wont feel that bad if I kill myself. Any thoughts?""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post mentions ""kill myself"" but does not include any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. It's a hypothetical statement, not a plan. So, it's not 'behavior'.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The post directly uses the phrase ""if I kill myself"". While conditional, it explicitly brings up the idea of the user ending their own life as a potential action, linked to a specific emotional context. This is a direct expression of contemplating suicide, which signifies an active suicidal thought or desire. It's not just general distress; it's a specific contemplation of suicide.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want. They are presenting it as a potential outcome or solution to a problem, seeking input on that specific premise. Therefore, it is not an 'indicator' due to negation.

Based on the definitions, the phrase ""if I kill myself"" indicates a direct contemplation or consideration of suicide, which fits the definition of Ideation: ""The post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die... The desire is clear, even if passive."" In this case, the desire is presented conditionally, but the thought of ""killing myself"" is present and active in the user's mind.

This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user is describing a recurring pattern of going to a specific location (ledge of a hospital parking garage) with the intent to jump (""Trying to work up the nerve to jump"").

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I can never get the nerve to jump"" and ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped."" This indicates that no actual attempt (completed or aborted) has occurred. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   **Suicidal Ideation:** The phrase ""Trying to work up the nerve to jump"" clearly indicates a desire to die by jumping. ""I go hoping I'll gain the courage"" reinforces this desire.
    *   **Method:** ""jump"" is the clear method.
    *   **Location:** ""ledge of a hospital parking garage"" is a very specific location.
    *   **Preparation:** The act of repeatedly going to this specific location (""I'll stand there. Or sit there. Sometimes for an hour. Trying to work up the nerve."") constitutes a preparatory act. This is not just thinking about it; it's actively putting oneself in a position to execute a plan and trying to gather the resolve to do so.

    Since there is clear suicidal ideation combined with a specific method, a specific location, and preparatory actions, this fits the definition of 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** (Not applicable as 'behavior' was identified). The desire is clearly present (""Trying to work up the nerve to jump"").

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** (Not applicable as 'behavior' was identified). While the user mentions ""maybe, just maybe someone will stop me,"" this does not negate the primary desire to jump or the preparatory actions being taken. The core intent is to gain courage to jump, not to reject the thought.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** (Not applicable).

Based on the hierarchy, 'behavior' is the highest risk category identified.

I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states: ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless."" It also says, ""I have multiple attempts on my life."" This clearly indicates past suicide attempts.
    The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""
    The post *does* mention past attempts. It also contains current ideation (""my death seems to ultimate answer"") and elements of a plan (searching for ""ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"").
    Because past attempts are present, and this is the highest category in the hierarchy, the classification should be 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** (Skipped because Attempt is already identified, and it's higher in the hierarchy). However, for completeness, the user is ""searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident,"" which indicates active planning/seeking a method. If there were no past attempts, this would lead to 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Skipped because Attempt is already identified). The user clearly expresses a desire to die: ""its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer.""

4.  **Check for Indicator:** (Skipped because higher risk categories are present). The user is not negating their suicidal thoughts; they are actively considering them.

Based on the hierarchy rule, the presence of past attempts immediately elevates the risk to 'Attempt', regardless of current ideation or planning.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior):** The post expresses extreme distress and a feeling of being ""done with everything,"" but it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to ending one's life.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post uses phrases like ""more dead inside"" and ""Im done with everything."" ""More dead inside"" is a metaphorical expression of emotional numbness or despair, not a literal desire to die. ""Im done with everything"" expresses extreme frustration, hopelessness, and a desire to stop trying, but it does not explicitly state a desire to *die*, *not be alive*, or *end one's life*. It's ambiguous and could refer to being done with specific situations or efforts, rather than life itself. It lacks the directness required for Ideation (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead"").
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The post does not mention suicidal thoughts that are then rejected.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post does not meet the criteria for Attempt, Behavior, or explicit Ideation, it falls into the Indicator category. It clearly expresses general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles without a stated, explicit desire to die. The user is expressing profound emotional pain and a sense of giving up on external efforts.

The user post is: ""I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a future action (""I think I can jump off,"" ""Hopefully I can do it soon""), not a past completed or aborted act. So, it's not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   **Method:** ""jump off,"" ""jump out of my bedroom window"" - Yes, a specific method is mentioned.
    *   **Timing:** ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" - Yes, a timeframe, indicating an intention to act in the near future.
    *   **Location:** ""out of my bedroom window"" - Yes, a specific location is identified.
    *   **Preparation:** ""I'm getting more courage"" - This indicates mental preparation for the act.
    Since there is clear suicidal ideation (""I think I can jump off,"" ""Hopefully I can do it soon"") combined with multiple elements of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation), this fits the criteria for Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a desire to die by jumping. However, since a plan is also present, it elevates beyond Ideation.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not negating the thoughts; they are actively contemplating and preparing for the action.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of a plan elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post mentions ""writing suicide notes."" While this is a preparatory action, it is not described as a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt itself (e.g., ""I put a belt around my neck""). Therefore, it does not fit the definition of ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post states, ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes.""
    *   **Suicidal Ideation:** The act of ""writing suicide notes"" inherently implies the presence of suicidal ideation. One does not write a suicide note without suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Component of Planning:** ""Writing a note"" is explicitly listed as a ""preparatory action"" under the definition of a ""plan"" for the Behavior category.
    *   Since the post describes a recurring preparatory action linked to suicidal thoughts, it meets the criteria for ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Ideation:** This category is for explicit desire to die without a plan. Since a preparatory action (writing suicide notes) is mentioned, it elevates the risk beyond mere Ideation.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** This category is for general distress or negated thoughts. The mention of writing suicide notes goes beyond general distress and is not negated.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of a preparatory action (writing suicide notes) elevates the risk to Behavior.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk of the given post. I will follow the provided step-by-step thinking process and then apply the hierarchy.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a desire to die (""hope i die"") but does not mention any specific plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). Therefore, it's not ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states ""hope i die maybe then ill get a good chuckle fuck me fuck da world."" This is a clear expression of a personal desire to die. This fits the definition of Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user does not negate the desire to die. While they mention ""maybe i just need attention yes its all a ruse for attention,"" this appears to be self-deprecating or questioning their own motives, rather than rejecting the suicidal thought itself. The core statement ""hope i die"" remains an active desire.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not reached because an active suicidal desire was identified.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt or self-harm is described.
*   **Behavior:** No plan is present.
*   **Ideation:** A clear desire to die (""hope i die"") is expressed without a plan. This is the highest risk category present.
*   **Indicator:** The desire to die is active and not negated.

Based on this analysis, the post fits the ""Ideation"" category.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post does not explicitly state a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead""). It describes an action.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The post does not express suicidal thoughts that are then rejected.
4.  **Check for Attempt:** The definition of ""Attempt"" includes ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes... non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting. The focus is on the past action."" The phrase ""Just cut to deep fuck"" clearly describes a past act of cutting, which is a form of self-harm/NSSI. This fits the ""Attempt"" category.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not express any suicidal thoughts directly, nor does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation). It is a rant directed at others.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains the phrase ""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice lmao."" This strongly implies that the user is experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings, given the context of people telling them ""don't do it!"". However, the post does *not* explicitly state a personal desire to die, such as ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead."" It expresses frustration with the *involuntary nature* of these feelings and the reactions of others, rather than a direct statement of suicidal intent or desire.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not explicitly negating their own suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I don't actually want to""). Instead, they are expressing anger at others who invalidate their implied suicidal feelings.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since there is no explicit statement of a desire to die, nor any plan or past attempt, the post falls into the Indicator category. It discusses suicide thematically (by reacting to comments like ""don't do it!"") and expresses significant distress and anger related to mental health struggles, but it lacks the direct, explicit expression of a desire to die required for Ideation. The core of the post is a commentary on the experience of having such feelings and the reactions of others, not a direct articulation of suicidal desire.

The user's post needs to be classified based on the suicide risk hierarchy. I will go through the steps:

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan)**: The post states ""i kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time"". There is no mention of a method, timing, location, or preparatory action. Therefore, it's not 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)**: The phrase ""i kinda just wanna die"" expresses a desire to die. However, this is immediately followed by ""but dont at the same time"". This negation is crucial. According to the rules, if the user expresses suicidal thoughts but rejects them, it falls into 'indicator'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)**: The phrase ""i kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time"" directly fits the definition for 'indicator': ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them"". The user is expressing conflicting feelings, where the desire to die is present but also explicitly negated or rejected. The surrounding text describes general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles, which also align with the 'indicator' category.

Based on the explicit negation of the suicidal thought, the post is classified as 'indicator'.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is asking for a suicide risk classification. I need to follow the provided hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. It mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""partially planning to die,"" but no past action. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, explicitly: ""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now,"" ""thinking about it most of the time,"" and ""want to justify dying.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? The post states: ""I've been thinking about partially planning to die."" While vague and not concrete action, ""partially planning"" implies mental engagement with the *how* of suicide, which falls under the ""planning"" component, even if it's preparatory thought rather than a physical act. The rule states, ""The presence of any of these, even if vague, elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior."" The phrase ""partially planning to die"" indicates a step beyond just wishing to die; it suggests the user is actively considering or formulating elements of a plan, even if incomplete. The user also mentions ""I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst,"" which adds to the concern regarding the ""partial planning.""

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While there is clear ideation present (""want to justify dying""), the presence of ""partially planning to die"" elevates the risk to Behavior, as per the hierarchy and definitions.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user does not negate their suicidal thoughts; they express them as their own active internal state (""I want to justify dying""). Therefore, it's not 'Indicator'.

Based on the explicit suicidal thoughts combined with the statement ""partially planning to die,"" which indicates a component of planning (even if vague or mental), the classification is Behavior.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a future plan (""drive out into the mountains and hike... find a nice little spot to hang myself"") and past *thoughts* about ending it (""too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears""), but it does not describe a past *action* or *attempt* of self-harm or suicide. So, it's not an ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   **Suicidal Thoughts:** The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die: ""i'm an ugly useless stupid girl who is better off dead,"" ""theres no fucking reason to keep playing this bullshit game,"" ""no reason to keep going,"" ""now i really don't care any more.""
    *   **Plan:** The post includes a concrete plan: ""i've been thinking i could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself. then i can rest in peace.""
        *   **Method:** ""hang myself""
        *   **Location:** ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot""
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and elements of a plan (method and location) are present, this post classifies as ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Ideation/Indicator:** (Not necessary as ""Behavior"" has been identified, which is a higher risk category).

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation and a specific plan (method and location), fitting the definition of Behavior.

210,I want to be dead. I don't enjoy anything. I am lonely. I am seeking therapy and taking antidepressants. I am not healing. It is terrible. I don't want to live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore,"" but it does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains the phrases ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore."" These are explicit and active expressions of a desire to not be alive or to die. This clearly indicates active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a direct desire (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore"") rather than describing intrusive thoughts they are rejecting (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). While they mention seeking therapy and taking antidepressants, this doesn't negate the direct statements of wanting to die.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not reached because active suicidal desire (Ideation) was identified.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die without any component of a plan. This perfectly aligns with the definition of ""Ideation.""

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post. I will follow the step-by-step thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for mentions of a method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   The post does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, rope).
    *   It asks ""when"" things will get better, but this is not a specific timing for a suicidal act (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
    *   No specific location is mentioned.
    *   No preparatory actions are described (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    *   Therefore, there is no plan present. This post is not ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The user states: ""But I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal.""
    *   They also say: ""Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts.""
    *   They express difficulty having ""any hope or motivation to go on.""
    *   These phrases clearly indicate an active, personal desire and experience of suicidal thoughts.
    *   Therefore, active suicidal desire is present. This post fits ""Ideation.""

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Before confirming Ideation, I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want.
    *   The user states they are ""unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts."" They do not say ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to"" or similar negations. They are stating their current, ongoing state.
    *   Therefore, the thoughts are not negated. This post is not ""Indicator"" due to negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is only reached if none of the above categories fit. Since ""Ideation"" was identified, this step is not applicable.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   No past attempt is mentioned.
*   No plan is mentioned.
*   Active suicidal desire is clearly expressed.
*   The suicidal thoughts are not negated.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses clear and active suicidal ideation without any elements of a plan or a past attempt, and the thoughts are not rejected. This aligns perfectly with the ""Ideation"" category.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post discusses needing therapy for depression and anxiety, and the difficulty of getting it due to financial and parental communication issues. There is no mention of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation) for suicide.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post expresses significant distress, lack of motivation, and a need for mental health support (""fix my fucked up self,"" ""don't even have the motivation to get up anymore,"" ""I need therapy""). However, it does not contain any explicit statements of wanting to die, wishing to be dead, or ending one's life.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** No suicidal thoughts are mentioned, so there are no negated thoughts to check for.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since there is no plan, no active suicidal desire, and no past attempt, the post falls into the category of general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles without a stated desire to die. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It talks about current thoughts and ideas, not past actions. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Crucially, the user states: ""i'd be lying if i said that didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method 🧍‍♀️."" This explicitly mentions gaining an ""idea of a new suicide method."" A ""method"" is a component of a plan, as defined in the 'Behavior' category.
    *   Even though the user also says ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that,"" the presence of a concrete ""new suicide method idea"" elevates the risk. The rule states: ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories... you must classify it as the highest risk category present."" Behavior is a higher risk than Indicator. The acquisition of a specific method idea, even if unwanted, constitutes a component of planning.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** (This step would only be relevant if it wasn't Behavior). The post implies suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""suicide method""), but the presence of a method idea makes it higher than just Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The post does contain a negation: ""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that."" If this were the *only* significant element regarding suicidal thoughts, it would be 'Indicator'. However, the subsequent statement about gaining ""an idea of a new suicide method"" introduces a planning component. Since 'Behavior' is a higher risk category than 'Indicator', and a component of a plan (method) is present, the classification defaults to the higher risk.

**Conclusion:** The post contains both a negation of suicidal intent (pointing to Indicator) and the acquisition of a specific suicide method idea (pointing to Behavior). According to the hierarchy rule, I must classify it as the highest risk category present. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the correct classification due to the mention of a ""new suicide method idea"" which is a component of a plan.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly describes a past event: ""A month ago I wrote a suicide note. I realized the date when I was going through my screenshots and found the note, primed and ready to be posted on social media... Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself."" This clearly describes an aborted attempt or a very advanced stage of preparation for an attempt that was stopped by the user themselves. The definition of Attempt includes ""aborted attempts."" The post also contains current ideation/desire: ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time."" According to the hierarchy rule, if a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt. This fits perfectly.
2.  Since ""Attempt"" is the highest risk category and was identified, no further checks for Behavior, Ideation, or Indicator are necessary.

I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post describes immense suffering, past abuse, health problems, and feelings of loneliness and worthlessness. However, there is no mention of any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
    *   *Conclusion: Not an Attempt.*

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts AND mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post contains phrases like ""i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" and ""I am hanging on by threads at this moment,"" which suggest suicidal ideation or a struggle to stay alive.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note).
    *   *Conclusion: Not Behavior.*

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The phrase ""i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" directly expresses a belief that their absence would be inconsequential, which is a form of suicidal ideation. It implies a desire or contemplation of not being alive.
    *   The statement ""I am hanging on by threads at this moment"" also indicates a precarious mental state where the user is struggling to maintain their will to live.
    *   *Conclusion: Yes, there is active suicidal desire/ideation.*

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Before finalizing on Ideation, check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The post does not negate the suicidal thoughts. The user states ""i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" as their own feeling, not an intrusive thought they are rejecting. While they mention ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present,"" this indicates a *struggle* to stay, not a rejection of the suicidal thought itself.
    *   *Conclusion: Not Indicator due to negation.*

Based on the hierarchy, the highest risk category present is Ideation.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post explicitly states ""all those word just make me want to die,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. It then provides a very specific plan:
    *   **Timing:** ""So Tuesday""
    *   **Method:** ""slit my wrist"" or ""hang myself from a tree""
    *   **Location/Means:** ""get into my broken car"" (implied as part of the ""slit my wrist"" scenario) or ""from a tree.""
    The presence of clear suicidal ideation combined with specific timing, methods, and locations definitively classifies this as Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** ""all those word just make me want to die"" clearly expresses active suicidal desire. However, since a plan is present, Behavior is the more severe classification.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating their suicidal thoughts; they are stating an intention to act on them.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as higher risk categories are present.

5.  **Hierarchy Rule:** The post contains suicidal ideation and a concrete plan for a future action. There is no mention of a *past* attempt. Therefore, ""Behavior"" is the highest applicable risk level.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him?

All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped.

Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. The mention of a robbery attempt where the user felt calm is not a self-harm or suicide attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** I will look for elements of a plan:
    *   **Method:** No mention of tools, substances, or weapons.
    *   **Timing:** No specific time (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my birthday"").
    *   **Location:** No specific place.
    *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    Since no elements of a plan are present, the post is not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" - Direct mention.
    *   ""I often feel that it would be better if I was dead."" - Clear expression of desire for death.
    *   ""It just seems so much better."" (referring to being dead) - Reinforces the desire.
    *   ""I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please."" - This is a very strong and active expression of desire for death.
    *   ""I'm not afraid of death either."" - Further supports the desire.
    *   ""think that suicide would be better."" - Direct statement.
    There is a clear and active suicidal desire expressed in the post.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Before classifying as Ideation, I need to check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want, as per the Indicator definition (e.g., ""My brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to."").
    The user states ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts but I dont think im depressed"" and later expresses confusion about *why* they have these thoughts (""Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.""). However, they *do not* negate the *desire* itself. They explicitly state ""I often feel that it would be better if I was dead"" and ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please."" The only things stopping them are external factors (selfishness, impact on loved ones), not a rejection of the desire for death itself. Therefore, this does not fit the ""negated thoughts"" criterion for Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post contains clear and active suicidal desire without any concrete plan. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow.

They are currently seeking a hotline that will not track them or call the police.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past suicide attempt or act of self-harm. The hospitalization was a consequence of a hotline call, not an attempt itself.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The user states that during the *previous* hotline call, they ""didn't have a method or anything."" The current post does not mention any plan (method, timing, location, preparation) for acting on their current suicidal feelings. While they state they are ""10x more suicidal,"" this is a statement of ideation, not a plan.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there"" is a direct and strong statement indicating an active, heightened state of suicidal feelings or desire. This is not general distress; it's an explicit acknowledgment of increased suicidal thoughts.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is *not* rejecting or negating their suicidal thoughts. They are stating that their suicidal feelings have *increased* (""10x more suicidal""). They are seeking a way to manage these heightened feelings without unwanted intervention. This is not an intrusive thought they are trying to fight off; it's a statement of their current internal state.

Conclusion: The statement ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there"" clearly indicates active suicidal ideation. There is no plan mentioned, and the thoughts are not negated.</thinking>

1. **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I dont want to live anymore"" and ""I just want be by myself."" There is no mention of a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
2. **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I dont want to live anymore"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to not be alive. This fits the definition of Ideation.
3. **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The statement ""I dont want to live anymore"" is a direct expression of desire, not a negated or unwanted thought (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to"").
4. **Default to Indicator:** Since Ideation fits, I do not default to Indicator.

Based on the hierarchy, ""I dont want to live anymore"" clearly places the post in the Ideation category as it expresses a desire to no longer be alive without a plan.

220,'If you are actually suicidal and not been attention seeking you would've told no one and just ended it silently so nobody could stop you' FUCK OFF. I FUCKING HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THIS LIKE ARE U JUST PLAIN STUPID. MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP. AND YOU SAYING THAT DOESNT HELP AT ALL AND MAKES ME HATE YOU BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL IF YOU SAY THAT. Everything I do that has something to do with my feelings I get called out for 'attention seeking.'. They don't care. They won't believe it until I die. Then they'll say 'oh why didn't he ask for help' BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT YOU SICK PIECE OF GARBAGE. Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user is expressing intense anger and frustration at being accused of ""attention seeking"" when they are trying to cope with their feelings and seek help.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: The post does not contain any elements of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation).
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The post states, ""They won't believe it until I die."" While this mentions death, it is framed as a consequence of others' disbelief, not an active desire or intent from the user. Crucially, the user also states, ""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP."" This directly contradicts an active desire to die and instead indicates a struggle to survive and a need for support.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user is expressing distress and a struggle to ""hold on,"" explicitly stating they ""still need help."" They are fighting against the dismissal of their feelings and are not expressing a desire to act on suicidal thoughts. The mention of death is a lament about others' lack of empathy, not a personal suicidal intent. This aligns with general distress and a plea for help.
4.  **Default to Indicator**: Given the absence of a plan or active suicidal desire, and the explicit statements about trying to ""hold on"" and needing ""help,"" the post best fits the Indicator category. It conveys significant distress and mental health struggles without expressing a personal desire to die.

221,"Fuck me i'm so lonely. Tbh im so fucking tired, friends are finding love all over but me, nada. i try so hard and it never works out, finding someone i care about and they care about me is the only thing i need in my life. Like im happy by myself but still i feel like im missing that one and ive gave it a chance over and over and over and over but no luck. I have no more strenght, i feel like killing my self every day and it huts so much. Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done, ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer but shit, nothing here for me. over and over again only to be dissapointed. Im sad to say this might be my final good bye. ill miss my family they've always taken care of me but there's only so much to be done.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **Check for Attempt:** The post describes preparations for suicide (""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"") and expresses a potential final goodbye (""this might be my final good bye""). However, it does not describe a *past* act of self-harm or a completed/aborted suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not 'attempt'.

2. **Check for Behavior:** The post clearly expresses active suicidal thoughts (""i feel like killing my self every day,"" ""Im sad to say this might be my final good bye""). Crucially, it also mentions concrete preparatory actions: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done."" This explicitly describes preparation, which is a key component of a plan. The phrase ""this might be my final good bye"" also suggests an imminent or planned action. Because there is both active suicidal desire and clear preparation, this falls into the 'behavior' category.

3. **Check for Ideation/Indicator:** Since the criteria for 'behavior' are met, there is no need to check for 'ideation' or 'indicator' as 'behavior' is a higher risk level. The user is not negating their thoughts; rather, they are expressing an active desire to die and detailing preparations for it.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the hierarchical classification system: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""I can't stop cutting."" According to the provided definitions, ""non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting"" is classified under 'Attempt'. The rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Since the post mentions ongoing cutting (a form of self-harm/NSSI) and also contains clear ideation and planning elements, the highest risk category is Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** (Although 'Attempt' is already identified, I'll check for completeness). The post contains phrases like ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am."" and ""I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon."" These indicate a clear intent to die with a timeframe (""very soon,"" ""soon""), which constitutes a plan. This would classify as Behavior if no Attempt was present.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Although 'Attempt' and 'Behavior' are identified). The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I'm going to kms,"" ""I'm about to kms""). This would classify as Ideation if no Behavior or Attempt was present.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The post goes far beyond general distress or negated thoughts.

**Conclusion:** The presence of ""I can't stop cutting"" (NSSI) immediately places the post in the 'Attempt' category, as per the definition and the hierarchy rule.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The post states: ""A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot."" This phrase includes a specific method (""shoot myself"") and a timing/location (""on the spot""), indicating a component of a plan.
    *   The post also mentions: ""So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash."" Writing a suicide note is a preparatory action, which is a component of a plan.
    *   Given the presence of both a desired method/timing and past preparation, the post contains elements of a plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   ""Family found out that I wanna kill myself"" - Explicit desire to die.
    *   ""really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more"" - Strong, active desire to die.
    *   ""A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot."" - Strong, active desire to die.
    *   ""They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault."" - Expresses a clear desire for their death and its impact, reinforcing the active suicidal desire.
    *   There is clear and active suicidal ideation throughout the post.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   There are no instances where the user expresses suicidal thoughts but then negates or rejects them. The desire to die is consistent and strong.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as higher risk categories are present.

**Hierarchy Application:**

*   **Attempt:** The post describes past actions (throwing away a suicide note) and a wish for an immediate action (""wish I could shoot myself on the spot""), but it does *not* describe a past completed or aborted act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not ""Attempt.""
*   **Behavior:** The post clearly expresses active suicidal ideation (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more,"" ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"") AND contains elements of a plan. The phrase ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" includes a method (""shoot myself"") and an immediate timing/location (""on the spot""). The mention of ""suicide notes I threw away"" also indicates past preparatory actions. The presence of both ideation and planning components classifies this as Behavior.
*   **Ideation:** While there is strong ideation, the presence of planning elements elevates the risk beyond Ideation.
*   **Indicator:** Not applicable.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of both active suicidal ideation and planning components (method, timing/location, and past preparation) classifies this post as Behavior.

Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post describes a future intention (""Think I'm going to OD today""), not a past act of self-harm or a completed/aborted suicide attempt. So, it is not 'Attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""Think I'm going to OD today,"" ""I feel like popping all of them at once,"" ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Method:** Yes, ""month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal.""
        *   **Timing:** Yes, ""today.""
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and elements of a plan (method and timing) are present, the category is 'Behavior'.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""Think I'm going to OD today""). This would be 'Ideation' if there were no plan. However, because a plan is present, 'Behavior' is the more accurate and higher-risk classification.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not rejecting the suicidal thoughts; they are actively considering acting on them. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

Based on the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is the highest risk category that applies.

1. **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will examine the post for elements of a plan: method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   **Method:** No specific method is mentioned.
    *   **Timing:** No specific timing is mentioned.
    *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:** The post contains several elements that strongly suggest preparation: ""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt and thank you to those who brought any light into my life,"" and ""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson. I'm sorry I wasn't a better person."" These phrases are classic examples of saying goodbye or writing a final note, which are explicitly listed as preparatory actions in the definition of ""Plan."" The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" also clearly indicates a desire for death. The combination of active suicidal desire and these farewells/apologies constitutes ""Preparation."" Therefore, the post fits the criteria for Behavior.

2. **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" clearly expresses a desire to die or end one's life. This confirms active suicidal desire.

3. **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** There are no phrases indicating that the user is rejecting or not agreeing with these thoughts. The thoughts are presented as what ""feels right now.""

4. **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as higher risk categories have been identified.

**Hierarchy Application:**
*   The post does not describe a past *Attempt*.
*   The post *does* contain active suicidal desire (""The end is the only thing that feels right now"") *and* elements of a plan (preparatory actions like saying goodbye/writing a final note). This classifies it as **Behavior**.
*   While there is *Ideation*, the presence of preparatory actions elevates it to Behavior.
*   It is not merely an *Indicator* because there is clear active suicidal desire and preparatory actions.

Based on the presence of active suicidal desire and clear preparatory actions (saying goodbye to loved ones, apologizing, thanking people, resembling a final note), the post falls into the Behavior category.

Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes current feelings and urges (""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat""), not a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it is not 'Attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):** The post expresses a clear desire to end thoughts/life (""all I want to do is shut every thought down"") and explicitly mentions a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat""). The presence of a specific method combined with suicidal desire qualifies it as 'Behavior'.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" clearly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die. This confirms ideation is present.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a strong urge and desire, not rejecting or negating the suicidal thoughts.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as a higher risk category has been identified.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat"") combined with a desire to end thoughts/life elevates the risk to 'Behavior'.

The user's post is discussing a quote about suicide.
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt by the user.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post does not express the user's own suicidal thoughts with any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation). The user is asking about a quote, not stating their own plan.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post does not explicitly express the user's personal desire to no longer be alive or to die. The user is referencing a quote that contains such a thought, but they are not stating it as their own desire. They are asking for more information about the quote itself.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they then reject. They are discussing a quote.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** The post discusses suicide thematically by referencing a quote about it. It lacks a personal, active desire to die from the user. Therefore, it fits the definition of Indicator: ""The post shows general distress, hopelessness, or discusses suicide thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die."" The user is engaging with the *topic* of suicide via a quote, but not expressing personal suicidal intent.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a desire to die (""i want to leave earth,"" ""i'm ready to join my dog"") but does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not ""Behavior.""
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains several phrases indicating a clear desire to die or not be alive: ""i want to leave earth,"" ""i always end up wanting to die,"" ""i'm ready to join my dog,"" and ""i can't do this anymore."" These are strong expressions of suicidal ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user does not express these thoughts as unwanted or rejected; rather, they state ""i'm ready to join my dog"" and ""i've accepted that,"" indicating acceptance of the desire to die. Therefore, it is not ""Indicator"" based on negated thoughts.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as a stronger category (Ideation) has been identified.

Based on the hierarchy, since there is clear active suicidal desire without a concrete plan, the classification is Ideation.

Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post mentions ""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" This describes a *past intention/plan*, not a *past action* or *attempt* (like ""I put a belt around my neck...then stopped""). The user did not act on it. So, it's not an ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post describes a *past* plan (""before Christmas hit""). However, the user explicitly states, ""Now, I know I can't do that."" and ""In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being."" This indicates a *negation* of the previous plan and current intent. There is no *current* plan. So, it's not ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post does not express a *current* desire to die. While it mentions ""Nothing has changed for me"" (implying underlying distress), it immediately follows with ""but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life."" and ""I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed."" The overall tone is one of *rejection* of suicidal thoughts, not an active desire. So, it's not ""Ideation.""

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The post clearly states past suicidal thoughts and a plan (""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit.""). Crucially, the user then *negates* these thoughts and plans: ""Now, I know I can't do that."" and ""In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being."" and ""I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed."" This perfectly fits the definition of ""Indicator,"" which includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post describes past suicidal ideation/planning but explicitly negates and rejects it due to a new perspective, it falls under the ""Indicator"" category.

Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention.

The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user is expressing ongoing suicidal thoughts and desires (""serious thoughts about suicide for days,"" ""When we fight I always think about suicide,"" ""triggers me to actually want to commit suicide""). This clearly indicates active suicidal ideation.

Next, I need to check for elements of a plan. The post states, ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself."" This is a crucial detail. Researching methods to kill oneself is a preparatory action, even if a specific method hasn't been chosen or a time/location hasn't been set. It shows an active step towards planning or considering the logistics of suicide.

According to the guidelines:
*   **Ideation** is explicit desire without a concrete plan.
*   **Behavior** includes ideation *and* a component of planning (method, timing, location, or preparation).

Since the user expresses a desire to die and describes a preparatory action (researching methods), this elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior.

There is no mention of a past attempt or self-harm, so it's not Attempt.
The user is not negating their suicidal thoughts; rather, they are questioning the *validity* of their feelings or whether they are ""faking it,"" but the desire itself is present and recurring. Therefore, it's not Indicator.

The presence of both suicidal desire and a preparatory action (researching methods) fits the definition of Behavior.

231,Life is useless. I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being. Death and suicide need to be normalized,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post states ""Life is useless"" and describes a desired state after death (""something better on the other side... without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being.""). It also says ""Death and suicide need to be normalized.""
    *   While there is a clear negative view of life and a positive view of a post-death state, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight""), location (e.g., ""bridge""), or preparatory action (e.g., ""writing a note"").
    *   Therefore, it does not fit the 'behavior' category.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   ""Life is useless."" - This is a strong statement of hopelessness and a negative evaluation of life.
    *   ""I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being."" - This is a clear expression of longing for a state of non-existence or a state only achievable through death, implying a desire to escape current life. This is a direct expression of wanting to not be alive in the current form.
    *   ""Death and suicide need to be normalized"" - While this is a general statement, in context with ""Life is useless"" and the longing for a post-death state, it reinforces the user's personal inclination towards death as a solution.
    *   The combination of ""Life is useless"" and the detailed description of a desired state *after* life strongly indicates a personal desire to no longer be alive. This fits the definition of Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   No, the user is not negating their thoughts. They are expressing their personal belief about life being useless and a desire for a post-death state. This is not an intrusive thought being rejected.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** This category is for general distress without a stated desire to die.
    *   Based on the analysis, there *is* a stated desire to not be alive, expressed through the longing for a post-death state and the declaration that ""Life is useless."" Therefore, it is not 'indicator'.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear desire to escape life and a longing for a state only achievable through death, without a concrete plan. This aligns with the 'ideation' category.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post discusses the ""thought of death"" and its perceived benefits (no pain, no hassle, infinity). It does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post asks ""Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?"" and describes the perceived positive aspects of death (""never feel pain anymore,"" ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""to be nothing,"" ""to let go""). While it expresses a longing for an end to suffering and romanticizes death, it does not explicitly state a personal, active desire to die, such as ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" It's more a rhetorical question about the *concept* of death's appeal rather than a direct statement of personal intent or desire.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting the thoughts. They are presenting them as beautiful.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since it's not an Attempt, Behavior, or clear Ideation (lacking a direct statement of personal desire to die), I will default to Indicator. The post expresses general distress (implied by the desire for no pain/hassle) and discusses death thematically (""the thought of death,"" ""black sea of infinity"") but lacks a *personal, active desire to die* in the present moment. It's an exploration of the *concept* of death's appeal rather than a direct statement of intent or desire to act.

233,"i'm getting my covid test results tomorrow. and i'll be deciding what to do once i get them. i've been feeling like absolute shit for the past few weeks. i've had sore throat, a possible fever, and now i have cough. aside from that, i've been feeling like a fucking outcast from everyone. my dad keeps getting mad at me for the smallest things while my friends basically don't fucking care about me. i'm so fucking tired and i want to reach out but there's literally no one i can go to. i'm literally just stuck in my head and it doesn't help that i'm also sick. all my life i just wanted to feel like i belong somewhere but i never fucking knew where. all i ever wanted was for someone to care about me so that i'd have something to hold onto, something that would give me another fucking reason to live. in the end, i receive jackshit. there's so much going on in my head that i can't even begin where to start or even know how to fix. but now, it all comes down to my covid results. if i'm negative, i'll run away. i'll leave everyone behind and whatever happens to me by then happens, it wouldn't matter anymore. if i'm positive, i'll kill myself. i used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore. i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day. it doesn't fucking matter to me anymore. this is selfish and irrational, i know, but honestly i just want to make one decision for myself for once no matter how fucking selfish it is. my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes future actions (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself""), not a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not an Attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** The post explicitly states, ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself,"" and ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day,"" and ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer."" This clearly indicates active suicidal ideation.
    *   **Plan:** The post includes a conditional timing element: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" This links the suicidal act to a specific future event (receiving COVID test results). It also mentions ""i'll use any method i can,"" which, while not a specific method, implies a readiness and commitment to finding one, indicating a planning component.
    *   Since both active suicidal desire and a component of planning (conditional timing, readiness for any method) are present, the post falls under the Behavior category.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Not applicable, as Behavior was identified).
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts/Indicator:** (Not applicable, as Behavior was identified).

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation linked to a specific future condition/timing and a readiness to use any method, which constitutes a plan. This classifies it as Behavior.

The user's post states, ""Failrure. I cant fucking kill myself ptoperlly, took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing."" This explicitly describes a past action taken with the intent to end their life, which fits the definition of a suicide attempt. The phrase ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" signifies a completed action in the past. Even though it was unsuccessful (""nothing""), it is still classified as an attempt. The post also contains current suicidal ideation (""What shoul i do kill mslef and stop being a burden and a disappoinment""), but according to the hierarchy rule, if a past attempt is mentioned, it takes precedence as the highest risk category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post states ""I might kill myself."" This indicates suicidal thoughts. Now, I need to check if there is any mention of a plan (method, timing, location, or preparation).
    *   Method: No specific method (e.g., pills, rope, weapon) is mentioned.
    *   Timing: No specific timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"") is mentioned.
    *   Location: No specific location (e.g., ""bridge,"" ""home"") is mentioned.
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye) are described.
    Since there is no element of a plan, it's not ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The phrase ""I might kill myself"" explicitly expresses a potential desire or consideration to end one's life. It goes beyond general distress and directly mentions suicide. It is an active expression of suicidal thought.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user does not express suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want to act on (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). The statement ""I might kill myself"" is a direct expression of a possibility or consideration, not a rejected intrusive thought.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses active suicidal desire (""I might kill myself"") without any concrete plan. This fits the definition of ""Ideation.""

The user post explicitly states ""I'm going to end it tonight"" and ""I will be non existent in about a few minutes,"" which clearly indicates active suicidal ideation.
The post also details a specific method: ""by taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil.""
It also specifies timing: ""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes.""
The phrase ""Goodbye world"" can be interpreted as a preparatory action (saying goodbye).
Given the presence of active suicidal ideation combined with a specific method, timing, and preparatory actions, this falls under the 'Behavior' category according to the definitions. It is not an 'Attempt' as it describes an imminent action, not a past one.

The user's post states, ""i want to kill myself.""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a desire to die (""i want to kill myself""), but it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""i want to kill myself"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to end one's life. This clearly indicates active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user does not negate or reject the suicidal thought. They state ""i want to kill myself"" as a personal desire, not an intrusive thought they disagree with.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as an active suicidal desire is present.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses active suicidal desire without a plan, fitting the definition of Ideation.

And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the defined hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I promised myself this after my first failed attempt in October."" This is a clear mention of a past suicide attempt. According to the rules, ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post *does* mention a past attempt and *also* current plans (""And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks"") and ideation (""I deserve to die and suffer while doing so""). Therefore, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Even if an attempt wasn't mentioned, the phrase ""And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks"" constitutes a plan with specific timing, which would classify it as Behavior. However, since Attempt is present, it takes precedence.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Phrases like ""life wants me to kill myself on my birthday,"" ""I deserve to die,"" and ""I will end myself"" clearly express a desire to die. This would be Ideation if no plan or attempt were present.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** This category is for general distress or negated suicidal thoughts. The post contains explicit suicidal ideation, a plan, and a past attempt, so it does not fit the Indicator category.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of a past suicide attempt is the highest risk factor.

Thanks to all of you that helped me survive to this moment.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post based on the given hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Analyze the post for ""Attempt"":** The post states, ""Today hits one month from my last suicide attempt"". This explicitly describes a past suicide attempt. According to the definition, ""Attempt: The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt."" This immediately qualifies the post for the ""Attempt"" category.

2.  **Analyze for ""Behavior"":** The post does not mention any current plans (method, timing, location, preparation) for suicide. In fact, the user states their suicidal thoughts are gone. So, it's not Behavior based on current intent.

3.  **Analyze for ""Ideation"":** The post explicitly states, ""My suicidal thoughts kinda left. And by kinda I mean they are gone. I think about death but not about doing it!"". This indicates a *lack* of active suicidal desire. So, it's not Ideation based on current intent.

4.  **Analyze for ""Indicator"":** The user states ""I think about death but not about doing it!"", which is a clear negation of suicidal intent, fitting the ""negated thoughts"" aspect of Indicator. However, this is superseded by the mention of a past attempt.

5.  **Apply Hierarchy Rule:** The hierarchy is Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator. The post contains an explicit mention of a ""last suicide attempt."" Even though the user expresses feeling better and a lack of current suicidal thoughts, the presence of a past attempt is the highest risk factor *mentioned in the post*. The rule states: ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories... you must classify it as the highest risk category present."" The description of a past attempt is the highest risk category.

Therefore, the classification is Attempt.

I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"". This directly negates the presence of a plan. Therefore, it's not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   Phrases like ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""I'm so tired,"" ""drowning in these awful thoughts"" indicate extreme distress and hopelessness.
    *   However, the post *does not* explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I want to end it all."" The phrase ""I can't take it anymore"" is often an expression of overwhelming distress, but not necessarily a direct desire for death.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Does the user express suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   The crucial part is: ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared.""
    *   ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"" rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   ""drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared"" strongly suggests that these thoughts are intrusive and unwanted, and the user is fearful of them, rather than actively desiring them or their outcome. Being ""scared"" of the thoughts implies a rejection of them or their potential implications. This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator' where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.

**Conclusion:** While there is significant distress and ""awful thoughts,"" the explicit negation of a plan and the expression of being ""scared"" of these thoughts place it in the 'Indicator' category, as the user is not expressing an active desire to die but rather struggling with unwanted thoughts and general distress.

I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time.

I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool.

Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The user explicitly states, ""I've never purposely hurt myself."" They describe imagining self-harm (""imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself"") but clarify these are thoughts, not actions, and they are afraid of pain. They mention being ""hospitalized in highschool for depression,"" but this is for a mental health condition, not a suicide attempt. Therefore, the post does not describe a past attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** The post clearly expresses a desire to die: ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I want to die or reverse time,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time."" This fulfills the ideation component.
    *   **Plan Elements:**
        *   **Method:** No specific method is mentioned (e.g., pills, rope, weapon).
        *   **Timing:** No specific timing is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
        *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
        *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions are described.
    *   The user mentions ""Hopefully the roof collapses or my matress turns into a large mouth and eats me or some stupid shit."" This is a passive wish for an external event, not a personal plan of action.
    *   Since there is no element of a plan, it is not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post contains clear and explicit expressions of a desire to die or not be alive: ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I want to die or reverse time,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time."" This desire is active and personal.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator vs. Ideation):** While the user mentions intrusive thoughts about self-harm (""imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself"") and states they don't act on them, the core desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I hate being alive"") is *not* negated. They are actively wishing for death and thinking about it constantly, held back only by the thought of upsetting their parents, not by a rejection of the desire itself. This confirms it is stronger than an Indicator.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** This category is only used if none of the above fit. Since Ideation fits, this is not the correct classification.

Based on the presence of clear, active suicidal desire without a concrete plan or past attempt, the classification is Ideation.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):** The post expresses a clear desire to die (""i'm really hoping i will die"") and specifies a timeframe (""tonight""). According to the guidelines, mentioning a specific timing (like ""tonight"") constitutes a component of a plan. Therefore, the post includes both suicidal ideation and a component of planning.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is not needed as Behavior was identified.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is not needed as Behavior was identified.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not needed as Behavior was identified.

The user has posted about a ""Zoloft overdose"" and explicitly states ""I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg and It obviously wasn't enough to kill me"". This clearly describes a past action taken with the intent to die. According to the definitions, specifically the ""Attempt"" category, ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts... The focus is on the past action."" The user's description of taking pills with the intent to die, even if it wasn't successful, fits this definition perfectly. The question about whether they will be okay without going to the hospital doesn't negate the past attempt; it's a follow-up question to the described past action.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""destined to do it,"" ""I've made my decision,"" ""there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan? Yes.
        *   **Timing:** ""At peace knowing it's soon."" This specifies a timeframe.
        *   **Preparation/Method:** ""Hope my plan works though."" The explicit mention of ""my plan"" strongly indicates a concrete plan exists, even if the details aren't shared. ""I've made my decision"" also implies a commitment to action.
    *   Since suicidal thoughts and elements of a plan (timing, explicit mention of ""plan"") are present, the category is **Behavior**.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While the post clearly expresses a desire to die (""destined to do it,"" ""no way I'm living""), the presence of planning elements (""soon,"" ""my plan"") elevates it beyond Ideation.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not rejecting or negating their suicidal thoughts; they are calm and at peace with their decision and plan. So, it is not 'Indicator'.

Based on the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is the highest risk category present.

I can deal with difficulties in life but realizing you're hopeless is too much. I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better. I just want to find an actual suicide forum.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user is expressing deep hopelessness and states, ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum.""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not describe a direct method, timing, or location for suicide. However, it does mention ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum."" According to the definition, ""Preparation: Describing preparatory actions"" is a component of a plan. Actively seeking out a ""suicide forum"" can be interpreted as a preparatory action, as it implies gathering information or resources related to suicide, which is a step towards potential action. This elevates the risk beyond mere ideation.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The user expresses extreme hopelessness (""realizing you're hopeless is too much. I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better."") and then states the desire to find a ""suicide forum."" This strongly implies an active desire to end their life, even if not explicitly stated as ""I want to die.""

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting suicidal thoughts; rather, they are actively seeking out a resource related to them.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as higher categories fit.

**Hierarchy Application:**
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt is mentioned.
*   **Behavior:** The desire to find a ""suicide forum"" constitutes a preparatory action (seeking resources/information for suicide), which, combined with the clear distress and implied suicidal desire, fits the ""Behavior"" category.
*   **Ideation:** While there is clear ideation, the *action* of seeking a forum moves it beyond passive ideation.
*   **Indicator:** This is not general distress; there is a specific action being sought related to suicide.

Therefore, the post is best classified as Behavior due to the preparatory action of seeking a suicide forum.

The user post expresses a clear desire to die: ""just want an end"" and ""die"".
It also specifies a method: ""slash my wrists"".
The phrase ""I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die"" indicates a strong, imminent intention to act on this method.
According to the definitions, the presence of suicidal ideation (""want an end,"" ""die"") combined with a method (""slash my wrists"") constitutes ""Behavior.""
The initial ""I tried, I guess"" seems to refer to trying to get away from parents, not a suicide attempt. The suicidal content is expressed as a current, imminent desire with a method.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, the post discusses future actions and desires (""I cannot wait to die,"" ""ill fix all of the funeral costs""). Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone.""
    *   It also mentions a preparatory action: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it."" This is a clear statement of preparing for the aftermath of their death, which constitutes a component of planning.
    *   Since both suicidal ideation and a preparatory action are present, the category is 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** (This step is effectively covered by the 'Behavior' check, but for completeness) The post explicitly states ""I cannot wait to die,"" which is a strong expression of a desire to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** (Not applicable as the thoughts are not negated but embraced)

5.  **Default to Indicator:** (Not applicable as higher risk categories fit)

Based on the presence of explicit suicidal ideation (""I cannot wait to die"") and a preparatory action (""ill fix all of the funeral costs""), the post falls under the 'Behavior' category according to the definitions.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it is not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses general despair and hopelessness about the future, but it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to ending life. There is no ""plan"" component. So, it is not ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   The post states: ""if life won't ever be as good again, what's really the point?."" This is a rhetorical question that strongly implies a lack of desire to continue living if life is perceived to have no value or future happiness.
    *   It continues with: ""i'm destined to live a depressed life because i can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past."" This reinforces the profound hopelessness and the belief that life will only be miserable, leading back to the ""what's the point?"" sentiment.
    *   While it doesn't use explicit phrases like ""I want to die,"" the questioning of ""what's really the point?"" in the context of such deep and perceived permanent despair about the future, goes beyond general sadness. It expresses a fundamental questioning of the value of continued existence, which aligns with the definition of ""Ideation"" (explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die, even if passively or implicitly through questioning the point of life).

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing their own feelings and conclusions (""what's really the point?"", ""I'm destined to live a depressed life""), not rejecting intrusive thoughts or discussing suicide thematically without personal desire.

Based on the analysis, the phrase ""what's really the point?"" combined with the severe hopelessness about the future (""destined to live a depressed life"") indicates an active questioning of the value of life, which is a form of ideation, even if not a direct ""I want to die."" It implies that if there is no point, then not being alive is the logical conclusion. This is stronger than just general distress or hopelessness.

Therefore, the classification is ""Ideation.""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It discusses future actions.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):** The post expresses a clear desire to die (""highest chance of death,"" ""hopefully everything pans out the way I want"" in the context of suicide) and includes multiple elements of a plan:
    *   **Method:** ""jump from a bridge""
    *   **Timing:** ""by the weekend""
    *   **Location:** ""NYC"" and seeking ""which one"" (implying a specific bridge will be chosen)
    *   **Preparation:** ""find out what's the best bet if I where to jump from a bridge which one do I have the highest chance of death"" - this shows active research and planning.
    Since there is clear suicidal ideation combined with a specific method, timing, and active preparation/research for a location, this falls under Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This is present, but the presence of a plan elevates it beyond just Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not rejecting these thoughts; they are actively pursuing them.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as a higher risk category has been identified.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of a clear plan (method, timing, location research, and preparation) combined with suicidal intent classifies this as Behavior.

The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny, right? Do I deserve it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and category definitions.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to ending one's life.
    *   The post expresses deep emotional pain, a feeling of being misunderstood, and a sense of inescapable suffering (""I am here to live in pain,"" ""The pain will never loosen it's grip"").
    *   There is no mention of any specific method (e.g., pills, weapon), timing (e.g., tonight, at 21), location (e.g., bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    *   Therefore, this post does not fit the ""Behavior"" category.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post contains phrases like ""I am here to live in pain,"" ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free,"" and ""The pain will never loosen it's grip.""
    *   These phrases convey extreme hopelessness and a sense of being trapped in suffering. However, they do not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I want to end it all,"" or ""I wish I were dead.""
    *   The statement ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free"" is a statement about the *perceived permanence* of suffering and the *impossibility* of escape (including death), rather than an active desire to die. It expresses despair that death/freedom is *not* coming, rather than wishing for it to come.
    *   Given the strict definition of Ideation requiring an *explicit* desire to die, this post does not quite meet that threshold. It expresses profound hopelessness about the *unending nature of pain*, not an active desire to end life.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts but clearly rejecting them.
    *   The post does not contain any phrases where the user negates or rejects their thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't actually want to""). The suffering and conviction are presented as their current reality.
    *   Therefore, this is not an Indicator due to negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress (""My parents never understands me and they treat me like shit""), hopelessness (""This is my place in the world. I am here to live in pain.""), and mental health struggles (""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip."").
    *   As established in step 2, it lacks an *explicit* desire to die. The core message is about the *permanence of suffering* and the *inability to escape* it, rather than an active wish to end life. This aligns perfectly with the ""Indicator"" definition.

Based on this analysis, the post fits the ""Indicator"" category as it expresses profound hopelessness and distress without an explicit desire to die or a plan.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation for a *current* suicidal act.
    *   The post states: ""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."" and ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from."" These express suicidal ideation.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for a *current* suicide. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior based on a *current* plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   ""What's the point?"" - General hopelessness.
    *   ""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."" - This is a clear expression of a desire for death.
    *   ""why bother going through all of it?"" - Questions the value of living.
    *   ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from."" - This is a strong, active desire for a permanent end.
    *   Based on these phrases, the post clearly expresses active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The user does *not* negate these thoughts. In fact, they describe them as ""welcome"" and ""hard to turn away from,"" indicating acceptance or even desire for them. They explicitly state ""But now I find myself in a different place"" regarding their past thankfulness that an attempt didn't work. This means the current thoughts are *not* unwanted or rejected.

4.  **Consider Attempt Category (Hierarchy Rule):** The definition for Attempt states: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts... Hierarchy Rule: If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""
    *   The post explicitly states: ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" This is a clear description of a past aborted attempt.
    *   As established in step 2, the post also contains *current* suicidal ideation (""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything,"" ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from"").
    *   Since there is both a past attempt mentioned *and* current ideation, according to the Hierarchy Rule, the classification must be 'Attempt'.

Final decision based on the hierarchy: The presence of a past aborted attempt combined with current suicidal ideation elevates the risk to 'Attempt'.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical classification process: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes future actions and current intent, not a past act of self-harm or a completed/aborted suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts/desire? Yes, phrases like ""I can't continue this disappointment,"" ""There's not hope anymore,"" and ""I plan on doing it"" clearly indicate a desire to end life.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
        *   **Location:** ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" specifies a clear location.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You."" This strongly resembles a farewell or a final message, which is a preparatory action.
    Since suicidal ideation is present along with elements of a plan (location and preparatory actions), the classification is ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While ideation is present, the presence of a plan elevates the risk to ""Behavior.""

4.  **Check for Indicator:** This level is for general distress or negated suicidal thoughts. Neither applies here as there is clear intent and a plan.

Based on the presence of suicidal ideation and concrete planning elements (location and preparatory actions), the highest applicable risk level is Behavior.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post ""Can someone just hug me please. I just want the pain to go away"".

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, not Attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not express suicidal thoughts with any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). It expresses distress, but not a plan to end life. So, not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die? Phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to end it all,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I'm going to die soon,"" ""I wish I were dead."" The phrase ""I just want the pain to go away"" expresses profound distress and a desire for relief, but it does *not* explicitly state a desire to die or to no longer be alive. It's a statement about the pain, not about ending one's life. It's not as direct as ""I'm going to die soon"" or ""I wish I were dead.""
4.  **Check for Indicator:** If none of the above fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die. The post ""Can someone just hug me please. I just want the pain to go away"" perfectly fits this description. It conveys deep emotional pain and a plea for comfort, which signifies general distress and mental health struggles, but it lacks the explicit statement of wanting to die that is required for Ideation. It also doesn't mention suicidal thoughts that are then rejected. Therefore, it defaults to Indicator.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I first look for active suicidal thoughts combined with a plan (method, timing, location, preparation).
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT,"" ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it.""
    *   However, it does not mention a *current* specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action for *ending it*. It describes past actions like taking painkillers and becoming addicted, which damaged their liver and digestive system, and self-starvation. These are descriptions of past self-harm or coping mechanisms, not a current plan for a future suicide act.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior based on a current plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Since it's not Behavior, I check for an explicit desire to die or not be alive.
    *   The post explicitly states: ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it.""
    *   This clearly indicates an active suicidal desire. If there were no other higher risk factors, this would be Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Before settling on Ideation, I check if the user is rejecting these thoughts.
    *   The user is presenting ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and stating their mind goes ""straight to wanting to end it."" There is no negation or rejection of these thoughts; they are presented as their own desire.
    *   Therefore, it is not an Indicator due to negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as active suicidal desire (Ideation) is present.

5.  **Re-evaluate against ""Attempt"" (Highest Risk):** The hierarchy states that if a post contains elements of multiple categories, classify it as the highest risk category present. The definition of ""Attempt"" includes: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes... non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting.""
    *   The post states: ""I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing.""
    *   This describes past acts of self-harm (addiction to paracetamols leading to liver/digestive damage, and self-starvation). These actions fit the description of ""past act of self-harm"" or ""non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI)"" as they caused physical damage to the self, regardless of the initial stated intent to ""cope.""
    *   The hierarchy rule for ""Attempt"" is: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post clearly has current ideation (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"") and describes past acts of self-harm.
    *   Therefore, the presence of described past self-harm, combined with current suicidal ideation, elevates the classification to ""Attempt.""

Final decision based on the hierarchy: Attempt is the highest risk category present.

The user's post needs to be classified based on the provided suicide risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""I feel like cutting myself again."" This phrase implies a past act of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt... and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting."" Since the user mentions a past act of cutting, this element alone points towards 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post states, ""I really want to fucking kill myself."" This is clear suicidal ideation. It then provides a detailed plan: ""I'm thinking about running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" This includes a method (train crushing head), a location (train station, train tracks), and a preparatory action (running away). The presence of ideation and a plan would classify it as 'Behavior'.

3.  **Apply Hierarchy Rule:** The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" In this post, there is an implied past attempt (NSSI: ""cutting myself again"") and current plans/ideation (the train station plan and ""I really want to fucking kill myself""). According to the rule, the highest risk category present is 'Attempt'.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I had a few suicide attempts, i don't regret them, and the most successful attempt involved me being saved by someone who committed suicide a couple years back."" This directly describes past suicide attempts. According to the rules, if a post mentions a past attempt, it is classified as 'Attempt', regardless of other elements present (like current ideation).
2.  **Hierarchy Rule Application:** The hierarchy states: ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories (e.g., a past attempt and current plans), you must classify it as the highest risk category present."" Since 'Attempt' is the highest risk category and is clearly present, no further checks for 'Behavior', 'Ideation', or 'Indicator' are needed for the final classification.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real."" and ""I feel shame for failing."" This indicates past actions or attempts at suicide. The phrase ""I'm going to try again"" further confirms a history of such actions.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post states, ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of..."" This indicates a clear plan (new method, easier to complete). It also mentions timing possibilities (""tommorow maybe,"" ""next week,"" ""next month,"" ""next year"").
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The entire post is permeated with a desire to die and end one's life.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** This level is clearly surpassed by the explicit desire to die and past actions.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:** The hierarchy states: ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories (e.g., a past attempt and current plans), you must classify it as the highest risk category present.""

Since the post describes past attempts (""Trying to kill myself..."", ""shame for failing""), even though it also contains strong elements of current behavior (planning a new method, considering timing), the highest risk category is **Attempt**.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and then select the appropriate category.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**:
    *   Does the post mention a method (e.g., pills, rope)? No.
    *   Does it mention timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"")? No.
    *   Does it mention a location (e.g., a bridge)? No.
    *   Does it mention preparation (e.g., writing a note)? No.
    *   Conclusion: There is no concrete plan mentioned. Therefore, it is not ""Behavior"" based on a plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**:
    *   Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The post contains phrases like ""I hate everything"" and ""It's over,"" indicating distress and hopelessness.
    *   Crucially, the post states: ""All I want is courage to end it."" This is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to end their life. It's not passive; it's an active wish for the means (courage) to act on that desire.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, there is a clear, active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**:
    *   Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want (e.g., ""My brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to."")?
    *   The phrase ""All I want is courage to end it"" is a personal desire, not an unwanted or intrusive thought. The user *wants* the courage to do it.
    *   Conclusion: The thoughts are not negated.

4.  **Default to Indicator**:
    *   Since an active suicidal desire (Ideation) was identified, the post does not default to Indicator.

**Final Classification Determination:**
*   It is not ""Attempt"" as no past action is described.
*   It is not ""Behavior"" because while there is clear ideation, there is no concrete plan (method, timing, location, preparation).
*   It is ""Ideation"" because it explicitly expresses a desire to end one's life (""All I want is courage to end it"") without detailing a plan.
*   It is not ""Indicator"" because there is a clear, active desire to die, not just general distress or negated thoughts.

The post fits the definition of Ideation perfectly: ""The post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die, but does not include any concrete plan.""

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post describes a future action (""I'm going out... I'm offing myself then""), not a past act of self-harm or a completed/aborted attempt. Therefore, it is not ""Attempt.""
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior):**
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I'm going out,"" ""I'm going out of this world,"" ""I'm offing myself then,"" ""Goodbye world"").
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Timing:** The post specifies a very precise date and time: ""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours."" This is a concrete timing element.
        *   **Preparation:** ""Goodbye world"" can be interpreted as a preparatory action (saying farewell).
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and specific timing, this meets the criteria for ""Behavior.""
3.  **Hierarchy Rule:** As ""Behavior"" has been identified, which is higher in the hierarchy than ""Ideation"" or ""Indicator,"" I will classify it as ""Behavior.""

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   Does the post mention a method? No.
    *   Does it mention timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"")? No.
    *   Does it mention a location (e.g., ""a bridge"")? No.
    *   Does it mention preparation (e.g., ""writing a note"")? No.
    *   Since no element of a plan is present, the post is not classified as Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   The post contains phrases like:
        *   ""Im done. I dont want to live."" - Clear desire to not be alive.
        *   ""I just want to die peacefuly."" - Clear desire to die.
        *   ""I want to kill myself so bad."" - Explicit desire to end life.
        *   ""I dont want to live like this."" - Reinforces desire to not be alive.
        *   ""It will never be better. It will never be fucking any better."" - Expresses hopelessness, supporting the desire to die.
    *   Yes, there is a strong and active expression of suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   Does the user express suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want? No. The user's statements are direct expressions of their own desire, not intrusive thoughts they are rejecting.

4.  **Default to Indicator:**
    *   This step is not reached because active suicidal desire (Ideation) was identified.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt or self-harm is described.
*   **Behavior:** No plan is present.
*   **Ideation:** Active suicidal desire is clearly present, without a plan. This fits the definition perfectly.
*   **Indicator:** The post goes beyond general distress; it explicitly states a desire to die.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses active suicidal desire without any component of a plan.

261,"Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me. I just can't do this anymore, all the upset and pain and hurt I cause. I have to make it stop.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the established thinking process and definitions.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states, ""I have to make it stop."" While this implies an action, it does not specify *how* (method), *when* (timing), *where* (location), or *what preparatory actions* (preparation). It's a general statement of intent to cease suffering, not a concrete plan for suicide. Therefore, it does not qualify as Behavior based on a plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me."" This strongly suggests the user believes their death would benefit others, indicating a desire to no longer be alive.
    *   ""I just can't do this anymore, all the upset and pain and hurt I cause."" This expresses extreme distress and a desire for their current state of existence to end.
    *   ""I have to make it stop."" In the context of the preceding sentences, this phrase clearly expresses a desire to end their life/existence to stop the pain and perceived burden.
    *   These phrases collectively demonstrate a clear, active desire to not be alive or to end their life.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they are rejecting or do not want. The statements are presented as their own convictions and desires.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since an active suicidal desire is present, the post does not default to Indicator.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear desire to no longer be alive and to end their life (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me,"" ""I have to make it stop""), but it does not include any specific plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post based on the given hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It talks about what they *would* have done, but not what they *did*. So, not ""Attempt"".

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post states: ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital."" This indicates a *desire* to act and a *barrier* to action (fear of failure/consequences), but it does *not* provide any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action. The fear of ""botching it"" highlights the *absence* of a clear, actionable plan.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for ""Behavior"" because a concrete plan component is missing.

3.  **Check for Ideation:**
    *   Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die?
    *   Phrases like:
        *   ""I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this."" (Expresses being at a breaking point, unable to continue living)
        *   ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it..."" (Clearly indicates a desire to ""do it,"" i.e., end their life, despite the fear)
        *   ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it."" (Explicitly discusses the outcome of ending their life and rationalizes it)
        *   ""I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this. It has to be better."" (Profound hopelessness and a belief that death is better than their current existence).
    *   Yes, there is a clear and active desire to die, or to not be alive, expressed throughout the post.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   No, the user is not negating the thoughts. They are expressing a desire to die, with fear being a *barrier* to action, not a rejection of the desire itself. The desire is present and active.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as active suicidal desire is present.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear and active desire to die (""I would have done it already,"" ""if I did it""), but it does not include any concrete plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). The fear of ""botching it"" prevents it from being classified as Behavior, as it highlights the *lack* of a confident, actionable plan. This fits the definition of Ideation.

( Not doctor diagnosed but I assume do to always been looking at things as glass being empty and not wanting to live.) Now as I'm getting older I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life. Of course I will wait till he's an adult but I just can't seem to get my life together. Every job I have ever wanted I can't get because my experience is in different fields.

And my son doesn't deserve that. 11 more years then yes I could be there but for now he just has a non successful dad that he is probably ashamed of. How do I deal with the pain of life. I feel like I'm a failure to my son, my parents, and everyone around me. Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user expresses a clear desire to ""leave this life"" and states ""I would say I'm suicidal."" This indicates active suicidal ideation.
The post also includes a specific timeframe: ""Of course I will wait till he's an adult."" This acts as a future timing for the expressed desire to end his life.
According to the guidelines, if suicidal thoughts and any element of a plan (including timing) are present, the category is Behavior.
The statement ""I would say I'm suicidal but I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that"" refers to the *immediate* action, but the explicit statement ""I will wait till he's an adult"" sets a future condition for the act, which is a form of planning (timing). This is not a negation of the suicidal thought itself, but a postponement.
Therefore, the combination of active suicidal desire and a specific timing element places this post in the Behavior category.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I just want off this life,"" which expresses suicidal ideation. However, it does not include any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I just want off this life"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to no longer be alive or to die. This fits the definition of Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a personal desire, not an unwanted or rejected thought.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since a stronger category (Ideation) fits, it is not an Indicator by default.

Based on the hierarchy and definitions, the post expresses a clear desire to die without any planning, which classifies it as Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and then apply the category definitions.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: I'm looking for a method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   The post states ""I need to kill myself, how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends."" The second part (""how do I minimise..."") is a consideration about the *impact* of the act, not a plan *for* the act itself. There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., tonight, at 21), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    *   Therefore, no plan is present. This rules out 'Behavior'.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: I'm looking for an explicit desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post explicitly states: ""I need to kill myself"". This is a direct and active expression of a desire to end one's life.
    *   Other phrases like ""life just isn't worth it"" reinforce this sentiment.
    *   The phrase ""I'm terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends"" indicates internal conflict and fear of consequences, but it does *not* negate the initial statement of needing to kill oneself. The desire is clearly present, even with ambivalence.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: I'm looking for phrases where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them.
    *   The user does *not* say ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to."" Instead, they state ""I need to kill myself"" and then express fear about the *impact* on others, which is different from rejecting the suicidal thought itself. The desire to die is stated as a personal ""need.""
    *   Therefore, this is not an Indicator due to negation.

4.  **Default to Indicator**: Since there is a clear, active suicidal desire, it does not default to Indicator.

**Applying Category Definitions:**
*   **Attempt**: No past attempt or self-harm is described.
*   **Behavior**: No plan is present.
*   **Ideation**: The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I need to kill myself"") but lacks any concrete plan. This fits the definition perfectly.
*   **Indicator**: The post contains a personal, active desire to die, and the thoughts are not rejected.

Based on the analysis, the presence of a direct and active desire to die (""I need to kill myself"") without any specific planning elements places it in the Ideation category.

It's a cycle that I can't escape.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. It talks about a future event (""By this time next week I'll be gone"").
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a clear intent to end one's life (""I'll be gone,"" ""no point in trying anymore"") and specifies a *timing*: ""By this time next week."" This explicit timeframe constitutes a plan.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive (""I'll be gone,"" ""no point in trying anymore,"" ""tired of fighting this constantly""). This is present.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting these thoughts; they are stating them as their current intent and expectation.

Based on the presence of active suicidal desire and a specific timeframe (""By this time next week""), the post falls under the 'Behavior' category as it includes a component of planning (timing).

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""I don't want to survive another attempt."" This explicitly refers to a past suicide attempt. The definition of ""Attempt"" includes describing a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. The hierarchy rule also states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post clearly mentions a past attempt and current ideation (""I hope I don't make it,"" ""I just want to die""). Therefore, the highest risk category present is Attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** Not applicable, as a past attempt is explicitly mentioned.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** Not applicable, as a past attempt is explicitly mentioned.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts:** Not applicable.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, the post describes current feelings and thoughts, not a past action.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)? The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"", ""death is the only escape""). However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? Yes. The phrases ""I wake immediately with suicidal thoughts swarming my head"" and ""death is the only escape"" explicitly convey a personal desire for death as a solution or escape from suffering. This is an active desire to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Does the user mention suicidal thoughts but clearly reject them or state they do not want to act on them? No. The post does not negate or reject the suicidal thoughts; rather, it presents death as the ""only escape,"" implying agreement with the idea.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die without a concrete plan, which fits the definition of Ideation.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user is asking for a classification of a social media post regarding suicide risk. I need to follow the provided hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes two specific past events.
    *   ""The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped."" While the user doesn't categorize it as an attempt, the description (""went until shortly before the point of no return"") fits the definition of an aborted attempt or a highly dangerous act of self-harm. The act of ""testing a method"" for suicide is inherently a high-risk behavior, regardless of the immediate intent to die at that exact moment.
    *   ""The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself."" This is a clear description of a past aborted suicide attempt, as the user explicitly states they ""went in with the intention of dying"" and ""stopped myself.""
    The definition for ""Attempt"" includes ""aborted attempts"" and focuses on ""the past action."" Both described events fit this criterion.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not describe any current suicidal thoughts coupled with a plan (method, timing, location, preparation). The user states, ""Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now.""

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post does not express a current desire to no longer be alive or to die. It is a retrospective analysis of past events.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** While the post expresses some current distress (""weighing on me,"" ""bothering me"") and discusses suicide thematically, the primary content and highest risk element is the detailed description of past aborted attempts.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:** ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories (e.g., a past attempt and current plans), you must classify it as the highest risk category present."" In this case, the presence of clearly described past aborted attempts elevates the classification to 'Attempt', as this is the highest risk category described in the post. The user is recounting specific past actions that fall under the definition of an attempt.

Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** I need to see if the post expresses suicidal thoughts AND mentions any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation).
    *   Method: No mention of tools, substances, or weapons.
    *   Timing: No specific time mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my 21st birthday"").
    *   Location: No specific place mentioned.
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions described (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    Since no element of a plan is present, it is not ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I need to determine if the post expresses a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post explicitly states: ""I really want to die.""
    *   It also states: ""I'd rather die than submit to anyone.""
    *   And: ""So what do I have to live for?"" (This implies a lack of reason to live, reinforcing the desire to die).
    These phrases clearly indicate an active suicidal desire.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Before finalizing on Ideation, I need to check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The statement ""I really want to die"" is a direct expression of desire, not a negated or unwanted thought. The user is expressing a genuine desire, not an intrusive thought they are fighting against.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since active suicidal desire (Ideation) was found, the classification will not default to ""Indicator.""

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear expressions of a desire to die (""I really want to die"") but lacks any component of a plan or description of a past attempt. This fits the definition of ""Ideation.""

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe a past suicide attempt or act of self-harm. It expresses a *wish* to act, not a past action.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post states, ""looking up how to do it,"" which indicates preparatory action for suicide. It also mentions specific methods: ""jump in front of a car or stab myself."" These elements constitute a plan.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The post clearly expresses a desire to die: ""i wish i had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself so this nightmare could all be over.""
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is not negating or rejecting the suicidal thoughts; rather, they are expressing a desire to act on them if they had the courage.
5.  **Hierarchy Application:** Since the post contains both active suicidal desire (ideation) and elements of a plan (preparation and specific methods), it falls into the 'Behavior' category.

If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post expresses current distress and a desire to die, but it does not describe any past actions of self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   *Conclusion: Not 'Attempt'.*

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back,"" ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all.""
    *   Now, check for a plan:
        *   Method: The user wishes for a ""nuclear bomb to just kill us all."" While this is a specific *method* of death, it's an external, hypothetical event, not a personal method the user intends to employ (like ""pills"" or ""a rope""). The definition of 'plan' in the context of 'Behavior' implies an action *by the individual*. This is more a passive wish for an outcome.
        *   Timing: No specific timing for a personal act is mentioned.
        *   Location: No specific location for a personal act is mentioned.
        *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are described.
    *   The wish for a nuclear bomb, while expressing a desire for death, does not constitute a *personal plan* as defined for the 'Behavior' category (which implies an action the individual would take or prepare for).
    *   *Conclusion: Not 'Behavior'.*

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   ""I don't want to be here anymore."" - Yes, a clear desire to not be alive.
    *   ""I want out so bad."" - Yes, a clear desire to end one's current state/life.
    *   ""I want to leave and never come back."" - Yes, a strong desire to cease existence.
    *   ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all."" - Yes, a strong expression of wishing for death.
    *   These phrases collectively indicate a clear, active desire to die or not be alive.
    *   *Conclusion: Yes, this fits 'Ideation'.*

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   The user's statements are direct expressions of their desire, not negated thoughts (e.g., ""my brain tells me to die, but I don't want to""). There is no rejection of the suicidal thoughts.
    *   *Conclusion: Not 'Indicator' due to negation.*

Based on the hierarchy, since it expresses active suicidal desire without a personal plan or a past attempt, the highest applicable category is Ideation.

273,It will all be done after I die. I want to die because I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color I'm just going to pull the trigger if a cop doesn't do it first.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. The phrase ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" refers to a future action, not a completed or aborted past one. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""It will all be done after I die. I want to die.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Method:** ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" clearly indicates a method (using a gun).
        *   Timing: No specific timing.
        *   Location: No specific location.
        *   Preparation: No preparatory actions.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation (""I want to die"") and a specific method (""pull the trigger""), this falls under the 'Behavior' category.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** (This step is superseded by Behavior, as Behavior includes ideation plus a plan). The post clearly states ""I want to die,"" which is active suicidal desire.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is expressing a direct desire and intent, not rejecting or negating the thoughts.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as a higher risk category (Behavior) has been identified.

According to the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is a higher risk than 'Ideation' or 'Indicator'. The presence of a method (""pull the trigger"") elevates it from Ideation to Behavior.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the established hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post states, ""I hurt myself two months ago"" and mentions ""my forearms with my wounds are visible"". This clearly describes a past act of self-harm, which falls under the definition of ""Attempt"" (specifically, non-suicidal self-injury or NSSI). The definition for ""Attempt"" explicitly states: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes... non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting."" The hierarchy rule also states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post also contains current ideation (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""). Therefore, the presence of the past self-harm act immediately elevates the classification to Attempt, as it is the highest risk category present.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Not applicable, as an Attempt has been identified as the highest risk. (If it were not an attempt, ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" expresses a desire to die but lacks any concrete plan elements like method, timing, or location, so it would not be Behavior).

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Not applicable, as an Attempt has been identified. (If it were not an attempt or behavior, ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" would fit Ideation, as it expresses a desire to no longer be alive).

4.  **Check for Indicator:** Not applicable, as higher risk categories are present.

Based on the clear mention of past self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"" and ""my forearms with my wounds are visible""), the post falls into the ""Attempt"" category.

275,"More than anything I want help and to get better, but I can't tell anyone. I just moved out of home, I live on campus now. I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much. At the same time, this is so much to carry alone, it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone. It's too much. I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post based on the given hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes thoughts, planning, and consideration, but no past action of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes: ""And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get,"" and ""I think about suicide every day.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? Yes: ""I write detailed plans in my journal."" Writing detailed plans is a preparatory action and a clear component of planning.
    *   Since both suicidal ideation and a component of planning are present, the post fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Only if not Attempt or Behavior)
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive (""the more suicidal I get,"" ""I think about suicide every day""). This would qualify as 'Ideation' if 'Behavior' wasn't present. However, because 'Behavior' is identified (due to planning), 'Behavior' is the higher risk category.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** (Only if not Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation)
    *   The post contains the phrase: ""But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did."" This statement suggests a rejection of acting on the suicidal thoughts, which is a characteristic mentioned in the 'Crucial Rule' for 'Indicator'.
    *   However, the primary definition of 'Indicator' also states it ""lacks a personal, active desire to die."" This post *does* express a personal, active desire to die (""the more suicidal I get,"" ""I think about suicide every day"").
    *   Furthermore, the user is actively ""writing detailed plans"" and ""seriously consider[ing] it only once a week or so."" This goes beyond general distress or unwanted/intrusive thoughts. The rejection (""I would never do it"") is presented as a *barrier* to action due to a specific reason (fear of hell), rather than a complete absence of desire or engagement with the idea.
    *   According to the hierarchy rule, ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories... you must classify it as the highest risk category present."" In this case, 'Behavior' (due to planning) is a higher risk category than 'Indicator'. The presence of detailed planning and active consideration outweighs the stated barrier to action for classification purposes, as the active engagement with planning elevates the risk.

Based on the hierarchy and definitions, the presence of both active suicidal thoughts and detailed planning in a journal classifies this post as 'Behavior'. The stated reason for not acting (""I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did"") is a protective factor, but it does not negate the active planning and ideation that define 'Behavior'.

276,:(. I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post "":(. I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal.""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, not Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The phrases "":(. I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal."" express extreme distress and a feeling of being overwhelmed, but they do not explicitly state a desire to die (like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead""). More importantly, there is no mention of a plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). So, not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   ""I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal."" expresses severe emotional pain and a feeling of being unable to cope. While this is very concerning and indicative of distress, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or to end one's life. It's a statement about current suffering, not a direct statement of suicidal intent. Phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead"" are required for Ideation. This post doesn't contain such explicit statements.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The post does not mention suicidal thoughts that are then rejected or negated.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles (""I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal.""). Since it doesn't explicitly state a desire to die, nor does it contain a plan or describe a past attempt, it fits the definition of an Indicator.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post: ""Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, it describes a current capability or intention, not a past action. So, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** Yes, ""I think I'm capable of committing suicide sober"" clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a perceived capability to act on them.
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Method:** No specific method (e.g., pills, rope, weapon) is mentioned. ""Sober"" is a condition, not a method.
        *   **Timing:** No specific timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"") is mentioned.
        *   **Location:** No specific location (e.g., ""at home,"" ""a bridge"") is mentioned.
        *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions (e.g., ""writing a note,"" ""saying goodbye"") are mentioned.
    *   While the statement ""I think I'm capable of committing suicide"" is very strong and indicates a readiness, it lacks any of the concrete planning elements required for the 'Behavior' category as defined. It's a statement of perceived ability/intent, not a step towards *how* or *when*.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die, but does not include any concrete plan?
    *   Yes, ""I think I'm capable of committing suicide sober"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire/capability to end one's life. It goes beyond general distress and directly addresses suicide. It lacks a concrete plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want (negated thoughts)?
    *   No, the user states ""I think I'm capable of committing suicide sober"" without any negation or rejection of the thought. It's presented as a realization or capability. So, it is not 'Indicator'.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear and active desire/capability to commit suicide, but it does not include any concrete elements of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation). Therefore, it falls under 'Ideation'.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or suicide attempt. So, it is not 'Attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior**: The post expresses extreme distress and a desire for things to be ""over"" or to ""be down,"" but it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for ending their life. There is no plan mentioned. So, it is not 'Behavior'.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The phrases ""Don't want tot. Do this anymore,"" ""I hate every part of my life o just want tit to be over,"" and ""I wasn't to be down"" (likely a typo for ""I want to be done"" or ""I want to be dead"") strongly indicate a desire to no longer be alive or for their life to end. ""I just want it to be over"" is a direct expression of wanting to end their current state of existence. This goes beyond general sadness or hopelessness.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they are rejecting or do not want. They are expressing a direct and active desire for their life to be over. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator' due to negation.
5.  **Default to Indicator**: Since the post contains an explicit desire to die/end life, it does not default to 'Indicator'.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive (""I just want tit to be over,"" ""I wasn't to be down"") but does not include any concrete plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, phrases like ""I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"" clearly indicate a desire to die. The user also states ""End it now"".
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? Yes, the post explicitly discusses methods:
        *   ""I don't want my head to explode via shotgun..."" (Mentions a method: shotgun)
        *   ""...for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth."" (Mentions a method: handguns, and a specific location for the method: through upper palate in mouth).
        *   ""I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier..."" (Implies research into other methods).
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and elements of a plan (specific methods and details about their application) are present, the category is **Behavior**.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While active suicidal desire is present, the presence of planning elevates the risk to 'behavior'.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not negating or rejecting the suicidal thoughts; rather, they are actively contemplating and researching methods to die, even if expressing fear about the process itself. General distress is present, but it's accompanied by clear ideation and planning.

Based on the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is the highest applicable risk level because the post contains both suicidal ideation and discussion of specific methods for suicide.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I want to die""). However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. The phrase ""I'm scared"" and ""Can someone please help me work out what to do"" indicates a lack of a concrete plan and a plea for help, rather than a developed plan. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" multiple times. This is a direct and active expression of a desire to no longer be alive.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** While the user states ""I want to die but I'm scared,"" the fear is about the act itself, not a negation of the desire to die. The desire is clearly present and repeated. It's not phrased as an intrusive thought that the user rejects (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). The ""What's the point"" further reinforces the hopelessness.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear, active desire to die without any component of a plan. This perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

284,"I can't stop thinking about suicide. I am not ok. I can't stop thinking about it. Then I cry about it. I have a plan,  idk if I should do it and end it.

I will just suffer till I end it. I know where I'll attempt, I know how, I know what I need, I know how and when I can run away from home. I know these things. It must be a Tuesday to run away.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user post explicitly states: ""I have a plan"".
It then details elements of this plan:
- ""I know where I'll attempt"" (Location)
- ""I know how"" (Method)
- ""I know what I need"" (Preparation/Method)
- ""I know how and when I can run away from home. I know these things. It must be a Tuesday to run away."" (Timing/Preparation)

The post also clearly expresses suicidal ideation: ""I can't stop thinking about suicide,"" ""end it,"" ""I will just suffer till I end it.""

According to the definitions:
- **Attempt:** Not present, as it describes future actions, not a past act.
- **Behavior:** The post includes both suicidal ideation (""I can't stop thinking about suicide,"" ""end it"") and multiple components of planning (method, timing, location, preparation). This fits the definition perfectly.
- **Ideation:** While ideation is present, the presence of a plan elevates it to Behavior.
- **Indicator:** The user is not rejecting the suicidal thoughts; they are actively detailing a plan related to them.

Therefore, the highest risk category present is Behavior.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out? I want to be done, I want to be out of this and I wish I could just sleep for now but I can't. I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore. Sorry for the total drivel, I'm so angry/down right now and I needed to vent.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post. I will follow the hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post describes current feelings and thoughts (""I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now,"" ""I almost hope something bad happens to me,"" ""I don't want to be here,"" ""I want to be done,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I do not want to exist anymore""). There is no mention of a *past* action like cutting, overdosing, or an aborted attempt.
    *   Therefore, it is not an **Attempt**.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan + Ideation):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts AND mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** Yes, abundantly clear: ""make me want to die,"" ""I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now,"" ""I almost hope something bad happens to me,"" ""I don't want to be here,"" ""makes me want to not exist,"" ""I want to be done,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I do not want to exist anymore.""
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Method:** No specific method mentioned (e.g., pills, rope).
        *   **Timing:** No specific timing mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
        *   **Location:** The phrase ""trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night"" is present. While it mentions a location (""into the night"") and an urge, it's phrased as ""fighting the urge"" and ""wandering off,"" which is more about escape or indifference to safety than a concrete *plan* for suicide. It lacks the specificity of a bridge or train station for a *suicidal act*. The user is expressing a desire to *not care* what happens, rather than a plan for *self-inflicted* harm.
        *   **Preparation:** No mention of writing a note, saying goodbye, etc.
    *   Given the examples, ""wandering off into the night"" is not specific enough to qualify as a ""plan"" for suicide, especially when compared to ""I want to be gone tonight"" or ""I plan to kill myself at 21."" It expresses a general desire to escape or not care, but not a concrete plan for *how* to end their life.
    *   Therefore, it is not **Behavior**.

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life, without a concrete plan?
    *   ""make me want to die"" - Explicit desire to die.
    *   ""I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now"" - Indifference to life/safety.
    *   ""I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over."" - Strong desire for an end to suffering, even if passively hoping for an external event.
    *   ""I don't want to be here,"" ""makes me want to not exist."" - Clear desire to not be alive.
    *   ""I want to be done, I want to be out of this"" - Desire for an end.
    *   ""I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore."" - Very explicit and repeated desire to not exist.
    *   These are all active and direct expressions of a desire to die or not be alive.
    *   Therefore, this fits **Ideation**.

4.  **Check for Indicator (Negated Thoughts or General Distress):** Does the user mention suicidal thoughts but reject them, or is it just general distress without a desire to die?
    *   The user is *not* rejecting the thoughts. They are expressing them as their current desire (""I want to die,"" ""I do not want to exist anymore""). This is not an intrusive thought they are fighting against in the sense of ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to.""
    *   While there is general distress, the core of the post includes explicit desires to die/not exist, which goes beyond general distress and moves into Ideation.
    *   Therefore, it is not an **Indicator**.

**Final Decision:** The post contains multiple clear and active expressions of a desire to die or not exist, but lacks a concrete plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the established thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will scan the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to suicide.
    *   Method: No specific method is mentioned (e.g., pills, rope, weapon).
    *   Timing: No specific time is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
    *   Location: No specific location is mentioned (e.g., ""bridge,"" ""home"").
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are described (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    *   Since no element of a plan is present, the post is not classified as Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post states: ""The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide."" This is a direct acknowledgment of suicidal thoughts.
    *   The post also states: ""Everyday I'm battling to stay alive."" This implies a struggle against dying.
    *   Crucially, the post says: ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive."" This is a clear and direct expression of a desire to die.
    *   The post also says: ""Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me."" These phrases reinforce the active desire for life to end and a belief that their death would be beneficial.
    *   Given these explicit statements, there is a clear active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The user states they find ""comfort"" in ideations of suicide and explicitly says ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive."" This indicates an active desire, not an unwanted or rejected thought. The user is not negating these thoughts.
    *   Therefore, this is not an Indicator due to negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is only if none of the above categories fit. Since ""Ideation"" clearly fits due to the active suicidal desire, I will not default to Indicator.

**Hierarchy Application:**
*   The post does not describe a past ""Attempt.""
*   The post does not include a ""Plan,"" so it's not ""Behavior.""
*   The post clearly expresses an active desire to die (""Most days I wish I wasn't alive,"" ""ideations of suicide""), which fits the definition of ""Ideation.""
*   The post goes beyond general distress and includes a personal, active desire to die, so it is not ""Indicator.""

Based on the hierarchy, ""Ideation"" is the highest risk category present.

How does someone not have any friends at fucking 22? What the fuck is wrong with me?. It's been over 3 months since I had a conversation with anyone. The loneliness is so painful. I just want connection. I can't take this anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   Does the post mention a method? No.
    *   Does it mention timing? No.
    *   Does it mention a location? No.
    *   Does it mention preparation? No.
    *   The post does not include any component of a plan. So, it's not 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):**
    *   The post states: ""If I had just one friend I wouldn't be thinking about killing myself."" This is a direct admission of currently ""thinking about killing myself.""
    *   It also says: ""I can't take this anymore,"" which, in context with the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, reinforces a desire for the current situation to end, potentially through death.
    *   This clearly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die, even if conditional on circumstances.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):**
    *   Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want? The statement ""If I had just one friend I wouldn't be thinking about killing myself"" indicates that the user *is* currently thinking about it, and attributes this thought to their loneliness. It's a conditional statement about the *cause* of the thought, not a rejection of the thought itself (e.g., ""my brain tells me to, but I don't want to""). The thought is present and acknowledged.
    *   Therefore, it does not fit the 'indicator' rule for negated thoughts.

5.  **Conclusion:** The post expresses an active suicidal desire (""thinking about killing myself"") without a concrete plan. This fits the definition of 'ideation'.

It feels like I'm strapped with heavy,ocked chains to the driver's seat of a car that has no brakes and is going at highway speed at night with weak lights and I have no idea where I'm going, and I want the constant anxiety and sadness of my pointles situation to stop by crashing into another car an frequently come close to doing it but never can because I'm afraid that I won't die on impact and that I'll just end up with pain that doesn't kill me and that I'll be restrapped into the car again.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post. I will follow the provided hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post describes a hypothetical action (""crashing into another car"") that the user ""frequently come close to doing it but never can."" This indicates a recurring thought or impulse, not a past completed or aborted act. So, it is not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post expresses a desire for suffering to stop ""by crashing into another car."" This describes a *method*. However, the user immediately follows this with ""but never can because I'm afraid that I won't die on impact and that I'll just end up with pain that doesn't kill me."" This explicit statement of inability to act due to fear of failure means that while a method is conceptualized, it is not a *concrete plan* that the user intends or is preparing to execute. A ""plan"" implies an intent to follow through, which is negated here by fear. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The user states, ""I want the constant anxiety and sadness of my pointles situation to stop by crashing into another car."" This clearly expresses a desire for their life/suffering to end, using a method that implies death. This is an active suicidal desire. Since it does not involve a concrete, actionable plan (due to the explicit negation of action), it fits the Ideation category.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user *does* want the outcome (pain to stop via death). They are not expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). Instead, they express a desire for an outcome and a method, but are prevented from acting on it by fear of failure. This is stronger than an Indicator.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die/end suffering, but the ""plan"" is immediately negated by an inability to act due to fear. This falls under Ideation.

My job and parents abuse me too. I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is expressing significant distress due to social isolation and abuse.
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    *   Does it include any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
        *   Method: No.
        *   Timing: The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" indicates a certainty of future action, but it does not specify a concrete timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""on my 21st birthday""). It lacks the specificity required for a ""timing"" component of a plan as per the examples provided. It's similar to ""I'm going to die soon"" which is classified as Ideation.
        *   Location: No.
        *   Preparation: No.
    *   Since no concrete plan component is present, it does not fit the Behavior category.
3.  **Check for Ideation:**
    *   Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself."" This is a clear and active expression of suicidal desire.
    *   Does it contain negated thoughts? No, the user is stating an intention, not rejecting an intrusive thought.
    *   This fits the Ideation definition: ""The post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die, but does not include any concrete plan.""
4.  **Check for Indicator:** This is not an Indicator because there is a clear, active desire to die (""I'm going to kill myself""), not just general distress or rejected thoughts.

Based on the hierarchy and definitions, especially the distinction between ""I'm going to die soon"" (Ideation) and ""I want to be gone tonight"" (Behavior), ""Only a matter of when"" falls short of being a specific timing component of a plan. It expresses certainty, but not a concrete plan. Therefore, the highest risk category present is Ideation.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past or current suicide attempt or self-harm.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post does not mention any plan (method, timing, location, preparation) for suicide. In fact, the user explicitly states, ""I won't commit."" The hypothetical scenario of an accident is not a self-initiated plan.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The user states ""Death is an option"" and ""It's not the worst outcome"" in the context of a hypothetical accident. While this shows a passive acceptance or lack of aversion to death, it is immediately followed by ""I won't commit."" This negates an *active* desire to die by their own hand. The question ""Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought?"" is a meta-cognitive reflection, not a direct expression of desire to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is discussing a thought (""Death is an option"") and then explicitly negates suicidal intent by saying, ""I won't commit."" This directly fits the definition of Indicator: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" The user is contemplating death as a concept or a passive outcome, but disavowing any personal intent to cause it.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a *future* action (""Tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me"") and *current* preparation (""I even have the stuff prepared""). It does not describe a *past* act of self-harm or a completed/aborted suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""Tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me"", ""finally kill me"").
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Timing:** ""Tonight"" is a specific timeframe.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"" explicitly states preparation.
    *   Since both active suicidal desire and multiple elements of a plan (timing and preparation) are present, this classifies as 'Behavior'.

3.  **Hierarchy Rule:** Since 'Behavior' is identified, there's no need to check for 'Ideation' or 'Indicator', as 'Behavior' is a higher risk category.

The user is expressing a desire for their life to end (""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends""). This indicates active suicidal ideation.
Crucially, they also state a specific method they have ""decided"" upon: ""to stop eating all together and starve myself."" This is a concrete plan to achieve the desired outcome of dying.
According to the guidelines, if suicidal thoughts and any element of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation) are present, the category is Behavior. The user has expressed both a desire to die and a specific method to achieve it.
The initial statement ""I'm to much of a pussy to kill myself"" might seem like a negation, but it's immediately followed by a *different* chosen method for self-termination, indicating a shift in method rather than a rejection of the desire to die. Therefore, it does not fit the ""negated thoughts"" criteria for Indicator.
This post clearly fits the definition of Behavior.

The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not express suicidal thoughts with any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation). So, it's not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The most relevant phrase is: ""I don't always wish to be gone"".
    *   This phrase implies that *sometimes* the user *does* wish to be gone. If interpreted as a current, active desire, it could be Ideation.
    *   However, the phrasing ""I don't *always* wish to be gone"" is a negation of a constant desire. It's not a direct, explicit statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead.""
    *   The user immediately precedes this with ""I know how precious that is [to be still standing],"" indicating a recognition of the value of life.
    *   The rest of the post focuses on general distress, confusion about life, past struggles, present loneliness, and a plea for connection (""I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️"").
    *   The overall tone is one of struggling *with* life and seeking support, rather than an active desire to end it. The qualified statement ""I don't always wish to be gone"" suggests a fluctuating thought, not a clear, active desire to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   The rule states: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them (e.g., intrusive or unwanted thoughts).""
    *   While ""I don't always wish to be gone"" isn't a direct rejection like ""I don't want to die,"" it indicates that the desire is not constant and is presented within a context of resilience and a desire for connection. The user is acknowledging a thought that comes and goes, rather than expressing a persistent, active desire.
    *   The post primarily expresses general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles without a *clear, explicit, active* stated desire to die. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is a nuanced statement that, in context, leans more towards acknowledging a fluctuating thought rather than a firm, present desire. The user's focus is on navigating their current difficulties and seeking support.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses general distress, loneliness, and mental health struggles. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is a qualified statement that doesn't amount to an explicit, active desire to die, especially when considering the surrounding context of resilience and seeking connection. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Indicator'.

I want a restart :/",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process:

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   No, the post does not describe any past actions of self-harm or suicide attempts.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""I'm depressed constantly, suicidal, and lonely,"" and ""I only feel worse knowing I'm hurting to delay the pain my death will cause."" This confirms suicidal ideation.
    *   Now, I need to check for a plan:
        *   Method: No specific method is mentioned (e.g., pills, rope, weapon).
        *   Timing: No specific time is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
        *   Location: No specific location is mentioned.
        *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are mentioned (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    *   Since there is no element of a plan, the post does not fit the Behavior category.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   Yes, the post explicitly states ""I'm... suicidal"" and mentions ""the pain my death will cause."" This is a direct and active expression of a desire to die or not be alive. The phrase ""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?"" also reinforces this sentiment.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Before finalizing on Ideation, does the user express suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   No, the user states ""I'm... suicidal"" as a current state and feeling, not as an intrusive thought they are rejecting (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). There is no negation present.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since Ideation fits, I do not default to Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""suicidal,"" ""my death will cause"") but lacks any component of a plan. Therefore, it falls under Ideation.

295,"Work is killing me but I can't quit. Suicide becoming more enticing. Tl;Dr: Working retail has destroyed my body but can't stop working or family will lift a fuss. Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it. Nothing is happening and I don't believe my environment facilitates forward moment. Therefore it is probably best I head out before it gets worse. If nothing changes, the fuck am I getting up in the morning for?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will analyze the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to suicide.
    *   The post states, ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here."" This explicitly states *uncertainty* about timing and method, rather than a concrete plan.
    *   There are no mentions of specific tools, substances, locations, or preparatory actions.
    *   Conclusion: No concrete plan is present, so it's not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   ""Suicide becoming more enticing."" - This is a direct statement that suicide is becoming appealing.
    *   ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here."" - This acknowledges the personal consideration of taking one's own life.
    *   ""Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now."" - This is a very clear and active contemplation of ending one's life.
    *   ""Therefore it is probably best I head out before it gets worse."" - While ""head out"" can be ambiguous, in context with the preceding statements, it reinforces a desire to escape the situation, potentially through suicide.
    *   ""If nothing changes, the fuck am I getting up in the morning for?"" - This expresses profound hopelessness and a questioning of the purpose of continuing to live.
    *   Conclusion: There is a clear and active desire/contemplation of ending one's life. This fits the definition of Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will determine if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not agree with.
    *   The user does not negate their thoughts. They express that suicide is ""enticing"" and that they are ""thinking about whether it would be best to end myself."" These are active considerations, not unwanted intrusive thoughts.
    *   Conclusion: The thoughts are not negated, so it is not an Indicator based on this rule.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is only if none of the above categories fit. Since Ideation clearly fits, this step is not applicable.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   Attempt: No past attempt described.
*   Behavior: No concrete plan described.
*   Ideation: Yes, clear active desire/contemplation of ending one's life.
*   Indicator: No, because there is an active desire, not just general distress or negated thoughts.

Based on the hierarchy, the highest risk category present is Ideation.

The user post explicitly states ""I just slit my wrists"" and describes the method used (""Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines""). It also indicates that the action has already occurred (""if you are seeing this then its already too late""). This directly aligns with the definition of ""Attempt,"" which describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. According to the hierarchy, ""Attempt"" is the most severe category. Therefore, no further checks for lower risk categories are needed.

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself. Is it better to be honest or is keeping quiet, potentially for his own health, better?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the social media post, focusing only on the person writing the post.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt by the author. It mentions a friend who is suicidal, but not the author themselves engaging in such actions. So, not Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior**: Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The author states, ""The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself..."" and ""...I don't want to keep going myself."" These phrases clearly indicate active suicidal desire.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action. The post is about the internal conflict of supporting a friend while experiencing similar feelings, not about planning an act.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)**: If not an attempt or behavior, does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The phrases ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself"" are direct and explicit expressions of a desire to no longer be alive. This is stronger than general distress.
    *   The author is expressing their own personal, active suicidal thoughts, not just discussing suicide thematically or in relation to someone else.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)**: Are the suicidal thoughts mentioned but clearly rejected or stated as unwanted?
    *   No, the author states ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself"" as their own feelings and struggles. They are not presenting these as intrusive thoughts they disagree with.

5.  **Default to Indicator**: Since active suicidal desire is present and not negated, it does not default to Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive (""I'm suicidal myself,"" ""I don't want to keep going myself"") but lacks any concrete plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

298,If I become worse it's other people's fault. If I become worse and do something bad or kill myself it's everyone else's fault for treating me different. It's not my fault. Everything is thier fault.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it is not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post mentions ""kill myself"" as a potential action. However, it does not include any specific plan elements such as a method, timing, location, or preparation. It's a conditional statement about a potential future action, not a concrete plan. Therefore, it is not 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post states, ""If I become worse and do something bad or kill myself it's everyone else's fault..."" The phrase ""kill myself"" directly expresses the concept of ending one's life. While it's framed conditionally (""If I become worse...""), it is a clear articulation of suicide as a potential action for the user themselves. This is an explicit mention of a desire or potential to die, rather than just general distress. It's not negated or rejected.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). Instead, they are presenting ""kill myself"" as a potential outcome for them, albeit a conditional one, and assigning blame. This is not a negated thought.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" as a potential action for the user, it goes beyond general distress or hopelessness. It expresses a desire/potential to die, even if conditional. Therefore, it is not an 'indicator'.

Based on the definitions, the explicit mention of ""kill myself"" as a potential action for the individual, even in a conditional context, falls under 'Ideation' because it expresses a desire or potential to no longer be alive, without a concrete plan.

It really took everything of me to be so vulnerable in such a dark moment, but it's gone. I don't know what to do, i just wanted someone to talk to about how i am desperate that it's impossible to find someone to talk to and how to go on when you can't.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past physical act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It mentions ""I wanted to die when I made that post,"" which refers to a past *feeling* or *desire*, not an action.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses extreme distress and hopelessness but does not mention any method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for suicide.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The post states ""I wanted to die when I made that post,"" which is a past expression of suicidal desire. However, it immediately follows with ""I just don't want to die."" This is a crucial negation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user explicitly states ""I just don't want to die,"" which is a clear rejection of suicidal thoughts or a desire to act on them, even while expressing profound hopelessness and past suicidal feelings. This fits the definition of Indicator: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" The primary current sentiment is one of extreme distress and a desire for help, coupled with a stated wish *not* to die.
5.  **Final Classification:** Based on the explicit negation of suicidal desire, despite the high level of distress and past suicidal thoughts, the post falls into the Indicator category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a *past* act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post states, ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point."" This is in the present tense, indicating current intent or struggle, not a completed or aborted past action. There is no description of a past event.
    *   *Conclusion: Not an Attempt.*

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and intent: ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point,"" and ""I'm ready to say goodbye.""
    *   However, it does not specify a method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note). The phrase ""am trying to kill myself at this point"" conveys active intent but lacks the concrete elements that define a ""plan"" for the Behavior category.
    *   *Conclusion: Not Behavior.*

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The statement ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point"" is a very direct and active expression of suicidal desire and current struggle.
    *   ""I'm ready to say goodbye"" also clearly indicates a desire to end one's life.
    *   While the post ends with ""but I'm also not,"" indicating ambivalence, the preceding statements are strong and explicit expressions of active suicidal desire. According to the hierarchy rule, we classify based on the highest risk present. The active desire is clearly stated and not negated as an unwanted thought.
    *   *Conclusion: Yes, active suicidal desire is present.*

4.  **Check for Indicator (Negated Thoughts/General Distress):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want, or is it just general distress?
    *   The user is not presenting these as intrusive thoughts they are rejecting (""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). Instead, they are stating their current active state (""I just straight up am trying to kill myself""). The distress is clearly linked to a desire to die.
    *   *Conclusion: Not an Indicator.*

Based on the analysis, the post contains clear and active suicidal desire without a concrete plan. This fits the definition of Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and then confirm with the category definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt?** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It discusses current feelings and potential actions, but no completed or aborted past action. So, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior?** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   **Method:** The post mentions ""My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of."" This indicates that means *have been removed*, not that a specific method is being considered or prepared. The user says ""I could do it right now,"" but doesn't specify *how*.
    *   **Timing:** ""I could do it right now"" expresses immediate capability and desire, but it's not a *specific commitment* to a time like ""tonight"" or ""at 21."" It's a statement about the present feeling of being able to act, rather than a planned timeframe.
    *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions are described.
    *   While the user states ""I could do it right now,"" this is an expression of intense, immediate ideation and perceived capability, rather than a concrete *plan* involving a method, specific timing, location, or preparation. The primary barrier mentioned is ""fear of death."" Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as a plan is absent.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   ""The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death."" - This clearly indicates a strong desire to kill oneself.
    *   ""I hate it."" (referring to their current state/life).
    *   ""I could do it right now."" - Expresses immediate desire and perceived capability to act.
    *   ""hope that I don't wake up"" - A direct expression of a desire to die/not be alive.
    *   ""I'm done."" - Expresses extreme hopelessness and a desire for an end.
    *   Yes, the post very clearly expresses an active, personal desire to die and end their life.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they *do not agree with or want*?
    *   No. The user is expressing their *own* strong desire to die, even if fear is a barrier. Phrases like ""The only thing preventing me from killing myself..."" and ""I could do it right now"" show a personal, active desire, not an unwanted intrusive thought.

**Conclusion:** The post demonstrates a very strong, active, and personal desire to die (""I want to kill myself,"" ""hope I don't wake up,"" ""I'm done""), but it does not include any concrete elements of a plan (method, specific timing, location, or preparation). The statement ""I could do it right now"" reflects immediate ideation and perceived capability, but not a structured plan. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself."" However, it does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, weapon), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., ""bridge""), or preparatory actions (e.g., ""writing a note""). The user's fear of death is a deterrent, not a component of a plan. Therefore, it is not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself."" It also says ""there's literally no point in me being alive."" These phrases clearly express an active desire to no longer be alive or to end one's life.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user states ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself"" as their own desires. While they mention fear of death as the only thing keeping them alive, this is a barrier to action, not a negation or rejection of the desire to die itself. They are not saying ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to."" Therefore, it is not Indicator due to negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as there is a clear, active desire to die.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The definition of ""Attempt"" includes describing a ""past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt,"" specifically mentioning ""aborted attempts."" The post states: ""I came extraordinarily close to killing myself. As in, my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with."" This describes a past event where the user had a fully formed plan and was very close to executing it, which fits the description of an aborted attempt or a very serious near-attempt. The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Even if there's no current ideation, the *mention* of a past attempt is the highest risk factor. This post clearly describes a past event that qualifies as an aborted attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** (N/A, as Attempt was identified) The post describes *past* planning, but there is no *current* plan or active suicidal ideation.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** (N/A, as Attempt was identified) The user explicitly states, ""I made the decision to live,"" indicating a lack of current active suicidal desire.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** (N/A, as Attempt was identified) The user is not expressing current unwanted suicidal thoughts.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** (N/A, as Attempt was identified)

Based on the explicit description of a past, highly prepared, and nearly executed suicide plan (""my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with""), this falls under the ""Attempt"" category, as it describes a past aborted attempt. The presence of this past event, even with current positive outlook, places it in the highest risk category according to the hierarchy.

And I'm angry that it would be considered selfish by so many",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post states, ""I'm angry at myself for not doing it years ago"" and ""I wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it"". This expresses regret for *not* having committed suicide in the past, rather than describing a past action or attempt. Therefore, it is not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a desire for non-existence (""wished I wasn't alive and wanted things to be over"") but does not mention any current or future plan, method, timing, location, or preparation for suicide. The regret is about *past* non-action, not a plan for *future* action. Therefore, it is not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive: ""I've wished I wasn't alive and wanted things to be over fairly regularly since about 2012"". The statement ""I wish that I had just done it... so that I didn't have to live through everything since then and that I wouldn't be here now"" indicates a current, active desire for non-existence. This goes beyond general sadness and directly expresses a wish to have died.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want. Instead, they are expressing a strong, active desire for non-existence and regret for *not* having acted on those desires in the past. This is not an intrusive thought scenario.

**Conclusion:** The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive and regret for not having died, which fits the definition of Ideation. It lacks a plan (Behavior) and does not describe a past action (Attempt). It is also not merely general distress or negated thoughts (Indicator).

The user is expressing suicidal thoughts (""I'm depressed and suicidal,"" ""still wanting to die,"" ""times where i just get ready to die"").
I need to check for a plan. The post explicitly states: ""I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a clear preparatory action, which is a component of a plan as per the definition (""Preparation: Describing preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye)"").
Even though the user mentions a hesitation due to ""administrative thoughts"" that ""makes me not want to"" *act*, they clarify ""while still wanting to die"" and ""times where i just get ready to die"". This means the desire to die is active, and a preparatory step has been taken. The hesitation is about the *logistics of dying*, not a rejection of the suicidal ideation itself.
According to the hierarchy, if suicidal thoughts and any element of a plan are present, the category is Behavior. The presence of a written note (preparation) combined with active suicidal desire (""still wanting to die"") fits the definition of Behavior.
It is not Attempt as no past act of self-harm or suicide attempt is described.
It is not Ideation because a component of a plan (the note) is present.
It is not Indicator because the user explicitly expresses a desire to die and has taken a preparatory step, rather than rejecting the suicidal thoughts as unwanted or intrusive. The hesitation is practical, not a negation of the desire to die.

One of my friebds thought i was stalking the friendd. I got in trouble woth my family and ive never been more suicidal in my life.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post describes a past action (""I fucked up yesterday,"" ""trespassed"") but these actions are not self-harm or a suicide attempt. It does not describe an aborted attempt or NSSI. So, not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""ive never been more suicidal in my life,"" which indicates suicidal thoughts. However, it does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., ""bridge""), or preparation (e.g., ""writing a note""). Therefore, it does not contain a plan. So, not 'behavior'.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""ive never been more suicidal in my life"" explicitly expresses a strong, active suicidal desire. It's a direct statement of their current mental state, indicating a desire to end their life or not be alive, even if it doesn't use phrases like ""I want to die."" It signifies a personal, active experience of suicidal thoughts.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting these thoughts. They are stating their current feeling of being ""more suicidal than ever."" This is not an intrusive thought they are fighting against.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since an active suicidal desire is present, it does not default to 'indicator'.

Based on this, the post expresses a clear, active suicidal desire without a plan, fitting the definition of 'ideation'.

We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? The post expresses extreme distress, paranoia, and a sense of being oppressed, but it does *not* express any suicidal thoughts or mention any plan to end one's life. So, it's not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? The post uses strong, negative language to describe Australia as a ""prison colony,"" ""Auschwitz,"" and a ""fascist regime"" where people are ""slaves"" and ""property."" It conveys a profound sense of hopelessness, oppression, and distress about the state of society and the user's perceived lack of freedom. However, it *does not* contain any explicit phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I'm going to die soon,"" or ""I want to end it all."" The distress is directed outwards at the perceived societal conditions, not inwards as a desire for self-harm or death. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts:** This step is for posts that *do* mention suicidal thoughts but reject them. Since no suicidal thoughts are mentioned, this specific check isn't directly applicable in that sense.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die. The post clearly articulates extreme general distress, hopelessness, and potentially paranoid thoughts about society and personal freedom. While it doesn't state a personal desire to die, the level of despair and distress about their perceived reality is significant and indicative of mental health struggles. This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator'.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a desire to die (""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus""), but it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. ""Go to Heaven"" is the desired outcome of dying, not a plan for *how* to die.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states, ""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus. Thats what I want more than anything else."" This is a clear and active expression of a desire to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting these thoughts; they are affirming them as what they ""want more than anything else.""
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as there is a clear stated desire to die.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die without any planning component, which aligns with the definition of Ideation.

310,Life is worse than death. Right now i have so many bad memories and thoughts in my head and nobody listens to me and my dad just yells at me and gives off this feeling of being tired of me and my mother is always occupied with her boyfriend and doesn't give a flying fuck about me. I have this hoplessness feeling like i'm stuck inside of a nightmare but i don't wake up and ugh. i'm sorry but right now i'm considering suicide because i can't fucking take it anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will examine the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to suicide. The post states ""i'm considering suicide"" but does not provide any specifics about *how* or *when* or *where* this might happen, nor any preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life. The phrase ""Life is worse than death"" indicates a preference for death over life. Crucially, the statement ""i'm considering suicide because i can't fucking take it anymore"" is a direct and active expression of suicidal ideation. It clearly indicates a personal desire or consideration to end their life.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will determine if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. The user states ""i'm considering suicide,"" which implies a personal contemplation, not an unwanted or intrusive thought that they are rejecting. Therefore, it does not fit the Indicator category based on negation.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is only if none of the above fit. Since Ideation clearly fits, this is not the default.

**Final Classification Decision:** The post explicitly states ""i'm considering suicide,"" which is a clear expression of a desire to end one's life. It lacks any concrete plan elements (method, timing, location, preparation). Therefore, it falls under the Ideation category. It is not an Attempt as no past action is described. It is not Behavior as no plan is present. It is not an Indicator as it expresses a direct desire/consideration for suicide, not just general distress or negated thoughts.

311,"I want to help my suicidal online friend who has been through literal hell but I don't know how and I'm scared. I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks. Sorry for the post that is all over the place I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The goal is to classify the suicide risk level *of the person writing the post*.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the author describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt *by themselves*?
    *   The post details the friend's multiple suicide attempts (""They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week"").
    *   The author does *not* describe a past attempt *of their own*.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the author express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation) *for themselves*?
    *   The author states: ""especially when I'm suicidal myself"". This is a clear statement of personal suicidal ideation.
    *   However, the author does not mention any specific plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) related to *their own* suicidal thoughts. The plans and attempts mentioned are solely attributed to the friend.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the author explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die *for themselves*?
    *   Yes, the author explicitly states: ""especially when I'm suicidal myself"". This is a direct and active expression of suicidal desire/state by the author. It goes beyond general distress.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Does the author mention suicidal thoughts but clearly reject them or state they do not want to act on them?
    *   No, the statement ""I'm suicidal myself"" is not negated. It's presented as a current personal state.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not reached as Ideation is clearly present.

Based on the author's direct statement ""I'm suicidal myself"", and the absence of a personal plan or past attempt, the highest risk category for the author is Ideation. The information about the friend's attempts and struggles is contextual but does not change the classification for the *author* of the post.

312,"Just kill me. Please! Just end my life! I beg you, end my pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post: ""Just kill me. Please! Just end my life! I beg you, end my pain.""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for mentions of method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   Method: No specific method is mentioned (e.g., pills, weapon).
    *   Timing: No specific time is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""tomorrow"").
    *   Location: No specific location is mentioned.
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are described.
    *   Since no element of a plan is present, this post is not classified as Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for phrases expressing a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   ""Just kill me."" - This clearly expresses a desire to die.
    *   ""Just end my life!"" - This clearly expresses a desire to end one's life.
    *   ""I beg you, end my pain."" - While focused on pain, the preceding phrases confirm this is a plea for an end to existence.
    *   Yes, there is a clear and active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The user is actively pleading for death, not rejecting the thoughts. There is no negation like ""but I don't actually want to.""
    *   Therefore, this is not an Indicator due to negation.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear, active desire to die/end life but lacks any component of a plan. This fits the definition of Ideation. It is more severe than Indicator because it shows an active desire to die, and less severe than Behavior because there is no plan. It is not an Attempt as no past action is described.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior**: Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life.""
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note).
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation**: Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The phrase ""I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life"" is a direct and explicit statement of a desire to die.
    *   The user elaborates on their logic, stating that ""the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth,"" which reinforces the desire to not be alive.
    *   The user states, ""I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision,"" referring to the decision to end their life. This indicates active consideration and a leaning towards the suicidal outcome.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: Before finalizing on Ideation, I need to check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The post states: ""Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above.""
    *   While there is a ""part of me"" that feels it's not the right thing to do, the user immediately negates the *strength* of this counter-thought by saying they ""have not been able to find a reason"" to listen to it, given their ""logic"" for ending their life. This is not a clear rejection of the suicidal thought (e.g., ""I don't actually want to""). Instead, it shows a struggle where the suicidal logic is currently dominant, and the user is seeking validation for it or a strong counter-argument they haven't found. The primary intent conveyed is a reasoned desire to end their life, not an unwanted intrusive thought.

5.  **Default to Indicator**: This is not applicable as the post clearly expresses an active desire to end their life, which fits 'Ideation'.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire to end their life without any concrete plan, and the counter-thoughts are not strong enough to be considered a clear rejection of the suicidal desire.

Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The user expresses a clear desire to ""end it all"" and discusses methods. They mention a ""gun"" as something that ""would solve everything,"" indicating it's a considered method, even if unavailable due to location. They also explicitly ask, ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"" This question indicates an active search or desire for a *method* to end their life. The discussion of a specific method (gun) and the search for ""a good option"" constitutes a component of planning, even if the specific method isn't immediately actionable or a full plan is not laid out. This fits the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains phrases like ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""my thoughts always just come back to this"" (implying suicidal thoughts), and ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"" These clearly express a desire to die or end their life. This confirms Ideation is present.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing a desire to end their life, not rejecting or negating these thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as Ideation and Behavior are present.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:** The post contains both active suicidal desire (Ideation) and a component of planning (discussion of a specific method like a gun and the search for ""a good option"" to ""end it all""). According to the hierarchy, if a post contains elements of multiple categories, I must classify it as the highest risk category present. Therefore, Behavior is the correct classification.

They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect.

The user post needs to be classified based on the suicide risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post expresses ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die,"" which are expressions of suicidal thoughts. However, it does *not* mention any specific plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). Therefore, it's not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains the phrases ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die."" These phrases, in isolation, would typically point to 'Ideation' as they express a desire to not be alive.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This is the crucial step. The user states ""I wish I could die"" but immediately follows it with ""I would worry about them if I died"" (referring to their dogs). This statement explicitly indicates a reason *not* to act on the suicidal thought. The user also details other aspects of their life, their struggles, their medication, and ends with ""I just needed to post. I have no one to talk to,"" suggesting a need for support and an outlet for distress rather than active intent. The phrase ""I would worry about them if I died"" functions as a clear rejection or negation of the desire to act on the suicidal wish, similar to ""My brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to."" It shows a protective factor that counteracts the expressed wish to die.

Given the explicit negation/protective factor (""I would worry about them if I died"") immediately following the expression of suicidal thoughts, the post falls into the 'Indicator' category, as it describes suicidal thoughts that the user does not want to act on or are tempered by strong reasons to live. The overall context is one of general distress and seeking an outlet.

The user post describes significant distress, self-disgust, and a coping mechanism. I need to classify the suicide risk based on the provided hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. The act of masturbating to the thought of killing oneself is described as a coping mechanism for a ""terrible feeling"" and a desire to ""get it out of my head,"" not a physical attempt or aborted attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post include suicidal ideation *and* a component of planning (method, timing, location, or preparation)? The user states, ""I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself."" While this is clear ideation, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., tonight, at 21), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory action (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye). The masturbation to the thought is a mental coping mechanism, not a physical step towards a plan.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die? Yes, the user states, ""I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself."" This is a direct and active expression of a desire to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want? The user says they ""kept thinking about wanting to kill myself."" While they describe the overall feeling as ""Terrible feeling and I just wanted to get it out of my head,"" this appears to refer to the disgust and the act of masturbating, not a rejection of the suicidal thought itself. The thought of wanting to kill themselves is presented as a genuine thought they were having in response to their distress. Therefore, it's not negated in the way an intrusive thought would be.

Based on this analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire to die (""wanting to kill myself"") without any specific plan. This fits the definition of Ideation.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses a desire to end life (""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life""), but it does not include any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. The mention of ""going to bed"" is a plan for sleep, not for suicide.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The post explicitly states a personal desire to die prematurely (""For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem.""), views suicide as a ""means of escape,"" and states ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it."" The user also mentions ""talking about wanting to end my life."" These phrases clearly indicate an active desire to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user does not negate their suicidal thoughts; rather, they affirm them as a personal decision and a solution. They are arguing for the acceptance of their desire, not rejecting it.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as active suicidal desire was found.

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear, active suicidal desire without any concrete plan or description of a past attempt. Therefore, it falls under Ideation.

318,"""your not cutting your faking it!"" stares at my arm motherfuckerly. Im tired of all the people who miraculously believe that im either cutting for attention or faking it. I've had issues with self harm in the past and I've gotten to the point where nobody really believes that im in pain. A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the step-by-step thinking process and then select the highest applicable risk category.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not mention any current plans (method, timing, location, or preparation) for suicidal action. It expresses general distress and questioning of life's worth, but no plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" expresses a questioning of the value of life, which aligns with suicidal ideation, though it's not as direct as ""I want to die.""

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The thought ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is not negated. It's a genuine expression of their current state.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** If no other categories fit, it would be Indicator. However, I need to check for 'Attempt' first, as per the hierarchy.

**Revisiting the Hierarchy and Definitions, especially 'Attempt':**

*   **Attempt:** The definition states: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts (e.g., 'I put the belt around my neck but then stopped') and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting. The focus is on the past action.""
    *   The post explicitly states: ""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out."" This describes a past act of self-harm/NSSI.
    *   It also mentions: ""Btw theres about a dozen scars."" This further confirms past self-harm.
*   **Hierarchy Rule:** ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""
    *   The post describes a past act of self-harm (which falls under the 'Attempt' definition) and also expresses current distress and a questioning of life's worth (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore""), which is a form of current ideation.

Given the clear description of a past self-harm incident, even if it was to ""relieve some of the pain"" (NSSI), it falls under the 'Attempt' category as per the provided definition. The presence of this past action, combined with current distress/ideation, elevates the risk to 'Attempt'.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post. I will follow the defined steps:

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: The post mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts,"" but it does not describe any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for suicide. Instead, the user states they are ""considering going to the hospital"" and ""I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point."" This actively negates a plan to act on the thoughts. Therefore, it is not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The post explicitly states ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts."" However, the crucial part is ""I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change."" This indicates that while the thoughts are present, the user is actively trying *not* to act on them and does not currently perceive themselves as a danger. This is not an active, unnegated desire to die, but rather a struggle with unwanted thoughts and a desire to seek help to prevent acting on them.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" but then immediately states a preference *not* to act on them (""I'd rather... go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts"") and a current lack of self-perceived danger (""I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point""). This perfectly aligns with the ""Crucial Rule"" for Indicator: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" The user is struggling with suicidal thoughts but is actively trying to avoid acting on them and seeking help.

4.  **Default to Indicator**: Since the post contains clear negations of acting on suicidal thoughts, despite their presence, it falls into the Indicator category. It's general distress with suicidal thoughts that are being resisted.

My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   **Method:** The user mentions ""heroin pretty much daily"" and being ""forced anti psychotics."" However, these are not presented as *methods for suicide*. The heroin use is described as an ongoing daily habit, and the antipsychotics are something they are resisting. There is no explicit statement or implication that they plan to use these substances *to die by suicide*.
    *   **Timing:** The user states ""Soon I will be finally dead."" This is a general timeframe, not a specific one like ""tonight"" or ""on my 21st birthday."" The ""Within 4 weeks"" refers to the forced institutionalization, not a planned suicidal act.
    *   **Location:** No specific location for a suicidal act is mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions are mentioned.
    *   *Conclusion for Behavior:* While there's a strong desire to die and a general sense of timing (""soon""), there is no concrete plan (method, specific timing, location, or preparation) for *how* they will die by suicide. The mention of heroin use is descriptive of their current state, not a suicide plan.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):**
    *   Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The post clearly states: ""I hope I die soon."" and ""Soon I will be finally dead."" These are direct and active expressions of a desire to die.
    *   *Conclusion for Ideation:* Yes, active suicidal desire is present.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):**
    *   The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. They are expressing their own desire to die.
    *   *Conclusion for Negated Thoughts:* Not an Indicator based on this rule.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as active suicidal desire (Ideation) is present.

**Final Classification Logic:**
*   Not ""Attempt"" because no past attempt is described.
*   Not ""Behavior"" because there is no concrete plan (method, specific timing, location, preparation) for suicide, despite the strong desire to die. The drug use is described as current behavior, not a suicide method.
*   It is ""Ideation"" because there is a clear, active desire to die (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead"") without a concrete plan.

321,"What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem. I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user is asking for the ""best position of the gun for hitting the brain stem."" This indicates a specific method (gun) and a clear intent to use it lethally. The question about ""best position"" is a form of preparatory action, seeking specific information to carry out the act effectively. The subsequent statement, ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you... I genuinely do not care for any of those things,"" explicitly rejects reasons to live and underscores a strong, active desire to die.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   **Method:** Yes, ""gun"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:** Asking ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem"" is a direct inquiry about how to effectively carry out the act, which constitutes a preparatory action.
    *   Since both a method and preparatory action are present, this qualifies as Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   The statement ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you... I genuinely do not care for any of those things"" clearly expresses a desire to die and a rejection of life, confirming active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   There are no negated thoughts. The user is expressing a clear, active desire and seeking information to act on it.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This is clearly beyond general distress.

**Hierarchy Rule:** The post contains both active suicidal ideation and components of a plan (method and preparation). According to the hierarchy, the presence of a plan elevates the risk to Behavior.
</thinking>

322,"there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head. everything just keeps getting worse, my mum saw my self harm scars and got angry at me and told me i have nothing to be upset over and i'm dramatic and stuff lol",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""my mum saw my self harm scars."" The definition for 'Attempt' includes ""non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting."" The mention of ""scars"" indicates a past act of self-harm. The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post also contains current ideation (""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head.""). Because there is a clear mention of past self-harm (classified as Attempt) and current ideation, the highest risk category is Attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** While there is strong ideation, there is no explicit plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) mentioned for *current* suicidal thoughts.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head."" This clearly expresses an active, persistent desire/thought of ending one's life, which is Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating the thoughts; rather, they are stating the thoughts are persistent and unwanted (""it wont leave my head""), but not rejected as ""intrusive thoughts I don't agree with.""
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk categories are present.

**Conclusion based on hierarchy:** The presence of past self-harm (scars) immediately elevates the classification to 'Attempt', especially when combined with current ideation.

323,"I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. No amount of sleep helps, I still feel like trash. I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it. I'm sick of life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post is: ""I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. No amount of sleep helps, I still feel like trash. I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it. I'm sick of life""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself,"" ""Let's just do it,"" ""I'm sick of life"").
    *   Now, look for a plan:
        *   Method: No specific method is mentioned (e.g., pills, rope).
        *   Timing: No specific timing is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
        *   Location: No specific location is mentioned (e.g., ""a bridge"").
        *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are described (e.g., ""writing a note,"" ""saying goodbye"").
    *   The phrase ""Let's just do it"" expresses a strong, active desire and readiness to act, but it does not provide any of the *components* of a plan as defined (method, timing, location, preparation). It's an expression of immediate intent, but without the specifics that elevate it to 'Behavior' according to the provided rules.

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):**
    *   Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   ""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself."" - Yes, this is a clear statement of belief that suicide is the solution and a desire to end life.
    *   ""Let's just do it."" - Yes, this is an active, direct expression of intent to act on suicidal thoughts and end one's life.
    *   ""I'm sick of life."" - Reinforces the desire to not be alive.
    *   These phrases strongly indicate an active suicidal desire.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   Does the user mention suicidal thoughts but clearly reject them or state they do not want to act on them? No, the user explicitly states ""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself"" and ""Let's just do it,"" indicating agreement and a desire to proceed.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not a default case, as active suicidal desire is present.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a very strong and active desire to die (""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it."") but does not include any specific elements of a plan (method, timing, location, or preparatory act) as defined in the 'Behavior' category. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** I will first check if the post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
    *   The post states: ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed."" This is a clear description of multiple past suicide attempts.
    *   The post also mentions: ""People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year."" This further confirms a past attempt.
    *   Additionally, the post mentions an imminent plan: ""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again.""
    *   According to the hierarchy rule: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Since past attempts are explicitly described, this post falls into the 'Attempt' category.

2.  **Check for Behavior, Ideation, Indicator:** Since 'Attempt' is the highest risk category and is clearly present, there is no need to check for lower risk categories. The hierarchy rule dictates that the highest risk category present should be chosen.

And to top things off. these influences and genetics I became an alcoholic and I just want this pain to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the four-step process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to ending their life.
    *   The post states, ""I just want this pain to end."" This expresses a desire to end suffering, which in this context, implies ending their life.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., ""bridge""), or preparatory actions (e.g., ""writing a note"").
    *   Therefore, it does not qualify as ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" directly conveys a strong desire for their overwhelming suffering to cease. In the context of the preceding litany of severe personal struggles (losing a friend, family issues, alcoholism), this phrase strongly implies a desire to end their life to escape the pain. It's an active, personal desire for their current state of being to conclude. This fits the definition of Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The statement ""I just want this pain to end"" is a direct expression of their own desire, not an intrusive thought they are rejecting. There is no phrasing like ""my brain tells me to, but I don't want to.""
    *   Therefore, it is not an ""Indicator"" based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is only if none of the above categories fit. Since ""Active Suicidal Desire"" (Ideation) fits, this step is not reached.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt or self-harm is described.
*   **Behavior:** No plan is described.
*   **Ideation:** A clear, active desire to end their pain (implying ending their life) is present without a plan. This fits.
*   **Indicator:** There is an active desire, not just general distress or negated thoughts.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to end their suffering, which translates to a desire to no longer be alive, without mentioning any specific plan. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

326,Fuck this. I finally admitted to my mom that I'm suicidal and don't think I'll make is past this summer and she smirked and rolled her eyes. Maybe it is time for me to fucking go.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""I'm suicidal,"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go.""
    *   It also mentions a timeframe: ""don't think I'll make it past this summer."" This is a specific future timing, which constitutes a component of a plan.
    *   Therefore, the presence of suicidal ideation combined with a specific timeframe elevates the risk to Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go,"" which are clear expressions of a desire to die. However, since a plan component (timing) is also present, it moves beyond Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not rejecting or negating the suicidal thoughts; rather, they seem to be reinforcing them (""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"") in response to their mother's reaction.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk categories fit.

**Hierarchy Application:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation and a component of planning (a specific timeframe). According to the hierarchy, if a plan is present, it falls under Behavior.

I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post based on the given hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This describes a past suicide attempt. According to the ""Attempt"" definition and the Hierarchy Rule, if a post mentions a past attempt, it is classified as Attempt, even if other categories are also present.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post also contains elements of a plan: ""I promise I wont fail this time. I'm gonna buy the right stuff. Say my goodbyes to the one I love. Gonna be gone after this weekend."" This clearly indicates planning (method, preparation, timing). This would classify it as Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post expresses a clear desire to die: ""It's over for me,"" ""I cant take it anymore. I cant do this,"" ""I'm drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore."" This would classify it as Ideation.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** Not applicable, as higher risk categories are present.

**Hierarchy Application:** The post contains elements of Attempt (past attempt) and Behavior (current planning). According to the hierarchy rule, ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories (e.g., a past attempt and current plans), you must classify it as the highest risk category present."" ""Attempt"" is the highest risk category. Therefore, the classification is Attempt.

The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The post states, ""I'm planning on killing myself at 30 or 25.""
    *   This explicitly mentions a ""plan"" and provides a specific ""timing"" (""at 30 or 25"").
    *   Even though the timing is in the future and there's a conditional aspect (""But if i still feel the same or worse by the time im around that age""), the direct statement ""I'm planning on killing myself"" combined with a timeframe constitutes a plan as per the definition. The example ""i plan to kill myself at 21"" was classified as 'behavior' for similar reasons.
    *   The phrase ""I'm sorry to the people i know in advance"" also suggests a form of preparatory action or farewell.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation (""I'm planning on killing myself"") and a component of planning (timing, implied preparation), this fits the 'Behavior' category.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Yes, the phrase ""I'm planning on killing myself"" clearly expresses a desire to end one's life. However, because a plan is present, it elevates beyond just Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting the suicidal thoughts. While they mention the possibility of rethinking or seeking help, the core statement is a plan with a conditional future execution, not an unwanted intrusive thought they are fighting against.

Based on the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is the highest risk category present because there is explicit ideation combined with a specific timeframe for a plan.

The user post needs to be classified based on the suicide risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The phrase ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" suggests distress and being close to a breaking point, but it does not explicitly state suicidal thoughts *with* a plan. There is no mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation. So, it's not 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die?
    *   ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" indicates significant distress and potentially being on the verge of something serious. However, it does *not* explicitly state a desire to die, such as ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I'm going to end it all."" It's a statement about a state of mind, not a direct desire for death. The rest of the post discusses societal perceptions and the suicide rate for men, which is thematic discussion, not personal ideation. So, it's not 'ideation'.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" clearly falls under general distress or mental health struggles. The post discusses suicide thematically by referencing the suicide rate, but it lacks a personal, active desire to die. It also doesn't contain negated thoughts. This fits the definition of 'indicator'.

The user post needs to be classified based on the suicide risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It talks about future actions. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone"" clearly implies ending their life.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Timing:** ""within 24 hours"" is a specific timeframe. This is a clear element of a plan.
        *   **Preparation:** ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :("" sounds like a farewell message, which is a preparatory action.
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and elements of a plan (timing and preparation) are present, the category is 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While there is active suicidal desire (""Don't be surprised if I'm gone""), the presence of a plan (""within 24 hours"", farewell) elevates it beyond just ideation.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not expressing general distress without a desire to die, nor are they negating suicidal thoughts.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of both suicidal ideation and components of a plan (timing and preparation) places this post in the 'behavior' category.

331,"Abused as a child. I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I don't have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: I will scan the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to ending one's life. The post describes severe ongoing abuse, feeling trapped, lack of options, and emotional manipulation. It mentions ""they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them,"" which refers to the parents threatening the user, not the user planning self-harm. There is no mention of any plan for suicide. Therefore, it is not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: I will look for explicit statements of a desire to die or not be alive. Phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" The post states, ""it's killing me."" This is an idiom commonly used to express extreme distress, frustration, or emotional pain, not a literal desire to end one's life. There are no other phrases indicating a direct desire for death. Therefore, it is not Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: I will check if the user mentions suicidal thoughts but explicitly rejects them. The post does not mention suicidal thoughts at all, so this check is not applicable.

4.  **Default to Indicator**: Since the post does not contain elements of Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation, it defaults to Indicator. The post clearly expresses general distress, hopelessness (""I don't have a choice,"" ""can't go to counseling,"" ""can't move out,"" ""no proof""), and severe mental health struggles due to ongoing abuse and feeling trapped. This aligns with the definition of Indicator.

What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post based on the given hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:**
    *   The post states, ""I'm bloodying myself up now"". This describes a current act of self-harm, which falls under Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI).
    *   The definition of ""Attempt"" explicitly includes ""non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting.""
    *   Therefore, the presence of current NSSI means the post qualifies for the ""Attempt"" category.
    *   Additionally, the post contains ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time."" This expresses active suicidal ideation and a sense of urgency (""now""), which could lean towards Behavior or strong Ideation.
    *   According to the hierarchy rule, if a post contains elements of multiple categories, I must classify it as the highest risk category present. Since ""Attempt"" is the highest category and current NSSI is present, this is the dominant classification.

2.  **Check for Behavior (if not Attempt):** Not applicable, as Attempt is identified.

3.  **Check for Ideation (if not Attempt or Behavior):** Not applicable.

4.  **Check for Indicator (if none of the above):** Not applicable.

Based on the explicit description of current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") which is categorized under ""Attempt"" (NSSI), this is the highest risk level.

333,"someone blow my head off. im fucking done. i always fucking wonder what people would think if they saw the real fucking me. I always see people who fucking cheat and mercilessly get bashed for it. i fucking deserve death, im tired if these stupidass ignorant people. please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post expresses a strong desire to die with phrases like ""im fucking done,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" and ""please kill me."" This clearly indicates active suicidal Ideation.

Next, I need to check for elements of a plan to determine if it's Behavior. The post says, ""someone blow my head off."" While this is phrased as a request for someone else to act, it explicitly mentions a specific *method* of death (being shot in the head). According to the guidelines, a ""plan"" includes mentioning a method. The presence of a specific method, even if externalized, combined with the clear desire to die, elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior.

There is no description of a past attempt, so it's not ""Attempt.""
The thoughts are not negated or rejected, so it's not ""Indicator.""

Therefore, the post contains both active suicidal ideation and a component of a plan (a specific method).

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""My only option is to cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now this wouldn't be a problem"".
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
        *   Method: No specific method is mentioned (e.g., pills, weapon).
        *   Timing: No specific time is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week""). The phrase ""if I ended my life right now"" is hypothetical and conditional, not a concrete commitment to act immediately.
        *   Location: No specific location is mentioned.
        *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are mentioned.
    *   Since there is no concrete plan component, it is not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):**
    *   Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? Yes.
        *   ""My only option is to cut my life short"" is a direct and explicit statement of a desire to end one's life.
        *   ""if I ended my life right now this wouldn't be a problem"" reinforces this desire to use death as a solution.
    *   This is a clear expression of active suicidal desire.

4.  **Check for Indicator (Negated Thoughts/General Distress):**
    *   Are the suicidal thoughts negated or rejected by the user? No. The user presents ending their life as ""My only option"" and a solution, not as an unwanted intrusive thought.
    *   Is it just general distress without a stated desire to die? No, there is a clear stated desire to ""cut my life short"".

Based on this analysis, the post explicitly expresses an active desire to end life without any concrete plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more.

The user post describes multiple instances of past actions taken with the intent to end their life. Specifically, the user states: ""most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again"". These are clear descriptions of past suicide attempts. According to the classification rules, if a post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt, it falls under the 'Attempt' category. The presence of current ideation (""I want to die"") does not change the classification, as per the hierarchy rule: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the established hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, it does not.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? The post describes a life full of hardship, unfairness, and a feeling of being trapped (""no way out"" in the context of family/relationship issues), but it does not express any suicidal thoughts or a plan.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? The post uses phrases like ""horrible life,"" ""My life sucks,"" ""total curse,"" and ""I have nothing."" While these convey extreme distress and hopelessness about their life circumstances, they do not explicitly state a desire to die, to end their life, or to not be alive (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I'm going to end it all""). The ""no way out"" refers to their current familial/relationship situation, not an intent to end their life.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Since no explicit suicidal thoughts were expressed, this check isn't directly applicable for negation.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** The post expresses significant general distress, hopelessness, and frustration with life circumstances, including systemic issues, personal relationships, and cultural pressures. It clearly indicates mental health struggles and a feeling of being overwhelmed and unfairly treated. However, it lacks a stated personal, active desire to die. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Indicator.

The user is expressing significant distress due to being caught with prohibited items and fearing parental knowledge and suspension.
1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt (aborted or otherwise). So, it's not Attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan)**: The post states ""I'm feeling suicidal"" and ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. However, it does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note). Therefore, it does not contain a concrete plan. So, it's not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire)**: The post explicitly states ""I'm feeling suicidal"" and ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more."" Crucially, it also says, ""I feeel the only escape to this situation is suicide."" This is a clear expression of a desire to die or end one's life as a solution to their distress. These thoughts are not negated. This fits the definition of Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user does not reject or state that they do not want to act on these suicidal thoughts. Instead, they frame suicide as ""the only escape,"" suggesting a personal, active consideration. Therefore, it is not an Indicator due to negation.
5.  **Default to Indicator**: Not applicable, as Ideation is a stronger fit.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of clear, active suicidal desire without a plan places this post in the Ideation category.

The user post needs to be classified based on the provided hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:**
    *   The post states: ""Yet the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks kn amd i jump away at the last minute."" This describes past aborted attempts.
    *   The post also mentions: ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."" This is a clear statement of a past suicide attempt.
    *   Furthermore, the post describes current actions related to a specific method: ""I am left wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink. ... I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks. But when I see it, I panic and jump away and start crying. I just want to know how not to be a coward and jump away when I see it approaching. ... How do I stay on the tracks?"" This describes *repeated, current aborted attempts* using a specific method (jumping in front of a train).

    According to the definition, ""Attempt: The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts... The focus is on the past action."" The post clearly describes multiple past aborted attempts and at least one past completed attempt (where 911 was called). It also describes ongoing, current aborted attempts. The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" This post fits this perfectly.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** (Not necessary as 'Attempt' has been identified, which is higher risk).
    *   Even if 'Attempt' wasn't present, the post contains clear ideation (""I know this is all I have left,"" ""I am left wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"") and elements of a plan (method: train; timing/location knowledge: ""know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks""). This would classify it as Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Not necessary).
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** (Not necessary).
    *   While there's a negated thought (""I really do not want to do this""), it's immediately followed by ""But I know this is all I have left"" and descriptions of active attempts/plans, indicating a strong overall desire to die despite the ambivalence. It's not merely intrusive thoughts being rejected.

Based on the explicit mention of past suicide attempts and current, repeated aborted attempts, the highest risk category is Attempt.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or suicide attempt.

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse.

Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The user states, ""I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night."" This explicitly mentions a timing (""graduation night"") for a suicidal act.
    *   The user also states, ""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life tbh."" This explicitly mentions a method (""stick some knives through my stomach"").
    *   Because there is clear suicidal ideation (""I don't know how much longer I can last,"" ""I just don't know what else to do,"" ""I can kill myself,"" ""be done with life"") combined with both a specific timing and a specific method, the post fits the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is not needed as a plan was identified, leading to Behavior.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is not needed as a plan was identified, leading to Behavior.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not needed as a plan was identified, leading to Behavior.

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation along with concrete elements of a plan (timing and method), classifying it as Behavior.

It doesn't seem to exist, not for me anyway. Decided to push through the holiday but commit when i get home. I have a few methods to try, I've already drafted my suicide notes. It's settled. I can't anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post explicitly mentions several elements of a plan:
    *   **Location/Preparation:** ""I've spent the past few days researching tall bridges in the place I'm staying."" This indicates research for a specific location and preparatory action.
    *   **Timing:** ""Decided to push through the holiday but commit when i get home."" This specifies a future timeframe.
    *   **Method:** ""I have a few methods to try."" This indicates consideration of specific means.
    *   **Preparation:** ""I've already drafted my suicide notes."" This is a concrete preparatory action.
    Since multiple elements of a plan are present, the post qualifies for the 'Behavior' category.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrases ""It's settled. I can't anymore."" clearly express a desire to end their life. This confirms suicidal ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting these thoughts; they are stating them as a firm decision (""It's settled."").

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as higher risk categories are present.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation *and* multiple components of a plan (researching locations, timing, methods, drafting notes). According to the hierarchy, the presence of a plan elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior. There is no description of a past attempt.

342,"I'm free. It looks like I'm finally free to end it all. For years I felt like I couldn't kill myself because I had to ""stay alive for"" my friends. Well, I don't have anyone worth staying alive for anymore. Looks like I'm finally free to commit lifen't. This is a blessing. Finally moving forward and looking into my options to end it all. Of course there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it, but I need to have the option to end it all. So, with those obstacles out of the way, I'm free to get cracking. I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row, and once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision. Live or die. This is a weight off my chest. It could finally be my time. If I decide to end it I'll be sure to wish you all a farewell. Goodbye for now!",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post discusses future actions (""finally free to end it all,"" ""looking into my options,"" ""once I'm ready to end it""). There is no description of a past attempt or self-harm.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** The post clearly expresses a desire to die: ""free to end it all,"" ""free to commit lifen't,"" ""end it all,"" ""end it,"" ""It could finally be my time."" This is strong ideation.
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Preparation:** The user states, ""Finally moving forward and looking into my options to end it all."" and ""I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row"". ""Looking into options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row"" are explicit preparatory actions.
        *   **Preparation (farewell):** ""If I decide to end it I'll be sure to wish you all a farewell."" This indicates a preparatory action of saying goodbye.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and multiple elements of preparation/planning (""looking into options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" ""wish you all a farewell""), this fits the 'Behavior' category.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** (Not applicable, as 'Behavior' was identified).

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** (Not applicable, as 'Behavior' was identified).

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation combined with explicit preparatory actions (""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" ""wish you all a farewell""). This combination classifies it as 'Behavior'.

I should be allowed assisted suicide. It's twice as worse to tell me to stay and suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation for suicide.
    *   The post contains phrases like ""I want to kill myself,"" ""I need to kill myself,"" and ""constantly suicidal."" It also says, ""I should be allowed assisted suicide.""
    *   While ""assisted suicide"" is mentioned, it's framed as a desire for a societal allowance or a philosophical point about their suffering, not a personal, actionable plan they are making or preparing for (e.g., ""I'm going to find a way to get assisted suicide tonight""). There is no specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action described.
    *   Therefore, this post does not meet the criteria for ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post clearly states: ""I want to kill myself?"", ""Wow I need to kill myself"", and ""constantly suicidal."" These are direct and active expressions of a desire to die.
    *   This goes beyond general distress and indicates a clear intent/desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The user is *not* negating their suicidal thoughts. They are presenting them as their genuine current state and a reason for their suffering (""when you're constantly suicidal, helping yourself isn't really much of an option you consider""). Phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" are presented as their own desire, not an intrusive thought they are fighting.
    *   Therefore, this is not an ""Indicator"" based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not needed as Ideation is clearly present.

5.  **Check for Attempt:** There is no description of a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.

**Conclusion:** The post explicitly expresses an active desire to die (""I want to kill myself,"" ""I need to kill myself"") without any concrete plan or description of a past attempt. The thoughts are not negated. This aligns perfectly with the definition of ""Ideation.""

344,Gonna end myself soon. Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a future action (""Gonna end myself soon""), not a past act of self-harm or a completed/aborted attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2. **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""Gonna end myself soon"" clearly indicates a desire to die.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan? Yes.
        *   **Method:** ""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on"" explicitly states the substances and the method (overdose).
        *   **Timing:** ""soon"" indicates a timeframe, even if not extremely specific.
        *   **Preparation:** Having the substances (""Have 1g..."") indicates preparation.
    Since both suicidal ideation and a clear plan (method, preparation, and general timing) are present, this fits the 'behavior' category.

3. **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is not needed as 'Behavior' has been identified.

4. **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is not needed as 'Behavior' has been identified.

5. **Default to Indicator:** This step is not needed as 'Behavior' has been identified.

Based on the hierarchy, 'Behavior' is the highest risk category identified.

345,"I'm Lonely. I don't know why but I'm constantly feeling alone. When I was in kinder I was always bullied and I didn't really make much friends. The neighbors that I had before were my playmates, but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I'm sorry if this was too long a read.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" This describes a past action of self-harm or an aborted attempt. According to the definition, ""Attempt"" includes ""aborted attempts"" and ""past act of self-harm."" This fits the criteria for ""Attempt.""
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post contains current ideation (""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood,"" ""I feel like I just need to do it"") but does not clearly describe a *current* plan (method, timing, location, preparation) for an *imminent* act. However, since an ""Attempt"" is already identified, this step is less critical due to the hierarchy.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post contains clear expressions of a desire to die or end life (""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead,"" ""I feel like I just need to do it""). This would qualify as Ideation if no higher category were present.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The post expresses general distress and feelings of loneliness and being an inconvenience. However, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts and past attempts elevates it beyond just an Indicator.
5.  **Apply Hierarchy Rule:** The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Since the post describes past aborted attempts and also contains current suicidal ideation, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I would like to feel that before I kill myself."" This indicates suicidal thoughts. However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for *how* or *when* the act would occur, beyond it being contingent on not feeling loved. There is no concrete plan described.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""before I kill myself"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to end one's life. It goes beyond general distress and clearly states suicidal intent, even if contingent on an unmet need.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting the suicidal thought. They are stating a condition under which they would act on it.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** This does not apply as active suicidal desire is present.
5.  **Hierarchy Check:**
    *   No past attempt is described, so not ""Attempt.""
    *   No concrete plan is described, so not ""Behavior.""
    *   A clear desire to end one's life is expressed (""before I kill myself""), fitting the definition of ""Ideation.""
    *   The thought is not negated, so it's stronger than ""Indicator.""

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die without a concrete plan, which falls under Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior**: The post contains phrases like ""Fuck life, I'm out"" and explicitly mentions ""the thought of suicide."" However, it does not include any concrete plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). ""I'm out"" is too vague to be considered a plan.
3.  **Check for Ideation**: The post expresses a clear desire to ""be out"" of life (""Fuck life, I'm out"") and explicitly states that ""the thought of suicide"" is a current, overwhelming, and unfixable issue for them. This goes beyond general distress and indicates an active consideration or desire related to ending one's life. It does not negate these thoughts.
4.  **Check for Indicator**: The post does not fit the Indicator category because it expresses a personal, active desire/consideration related to suicide (""Fuck life, I'm out,"" ""the thought of suicide"") and does not reject these thoughts. It's more than just general distress or thematic discussion.

Based on this analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or mentions suicide as a current, personal, and unfixable thought, but without any concrete plan. This fits the definition of Ideation.

For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes past feelings and thoughts, but no past act of self-harm or suicide attempt. It mentions ""on the verge on becoming suicidal"" but explicitly states, ""Never really thought I would act it out."" So, not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not describe any current suicidal thoughts with a plan (method, timing, location, preparation). The thoughts about ""what if I wasn't in this world"" are presented as past thoughts that ""scared"" the user. So, not 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post describes *past* thoughts of not being in this world (""At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace?""). However, it immediately follows this with ""These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out."" This indicates that while the thoughts occurred, they were rejected and not acted upon. The current tone of the post is reflective, offering advice and hope (""Honestly, there is so much more to life... Life can be very beautiful... For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book...""). The user is not expressing a *current* desire to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The post explicitly states that the suicidal thoughts they experienced in the past ""scared"" them and they ""Never really thought I would act it out."" This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Indicator' where ""the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" The post is a reflection on past distress and unwanted thoughts, leading to a message of hope and advice for others.

Therefore, based on the explicit negation of acting on the past suicidal thoughts and the current supportive tone, the classification is Indicator.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post explicitly states ""I think i'm gonna try to end myself again tonight"" and ""I think i'm going to try and end it tonight again"". The word ""again"" signifies a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. According to the ""Attempt"" definition: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt."" and the ""Hierarchy Rule: If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" This post clearly mentions a past attempt (""again"") and also includes current plans (timing: ""tonight"", method: ""overdose""). Therefore, it falls under the ""Attempt"" category.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post also contains elements of Behavior (suicidal ideation: ""end myself"" and planning: ""tonight"", ""overdose""). However, because a past attempt is explicitly mentioned, the ""Attempt"" category takes precedence due to the hierarchy rule.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post goes beyond simple ideation by including a plan and referencing a past attempt.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The post expresses a clear desire to die and a plan, not just general distress or negated thoughts.

Based on the hierarchy rule, the presence of a past attempt (""again"") makes the highest risk category ""Attempt"".

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It speaks of a future event (""coming to an end"").
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** The post clearly expresses a desire to die: ""I think my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all.""
    *   **Plan Component - Timing:** The phrase ""in the next month or two"" provides a specific timeframe for the anticipated death. This constitutes a component of planning.
    *   **Plan Component - Preparation:** The statement ""For anyone who has read this, thank you. Even if just one person reads this, it means a lot to me that you did."" can be interpreted as a form of saying goodbye or a final message, which falls under preparatory actions.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and elements of a plan (timing and potential preparation), the post falls into the Behavior category.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This is present, but the presence of a plan elevates it to Behavior.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting these thoughts; rather, they are expressing an acceptance of their impending end.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as higher risk categories were identified.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear desire to die (""My death will release my pain"") and includes a specific timeframe (""in the next month or two"") and what could be interpreted as a preparatory action (thanking readers as a final message). This combination places it in the Behavior category.

The user post needs to be classified based on the suicide risk hierarchy. I will go through the thinking process step-by-step.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**:
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I'm ready to do it,"" ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""I've run out of options.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan? Yes, very explicitly.
        *   **Method**: ""a knife and some pills""
        *   **Timing**: ""It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK,"" ""about to lock myself in the bathroom"" (imminent action)
        *   **Location**: ""in the bathroom""
        *   **Preparation**: ""about to lock myself in the bathroom""
    *   Since suicidal thoughts and multiple elements of a concrete plan are present, the category is **Behavior**.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: While there is clear active suicidal desire (""I'm ready to do it,"" ""suicide is on my mind""), the presence of a plan elevates it beyond Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user states, ""I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options."" While ""I don't want to do this"" might seem like a negation, it is immediately followed by ""but I've run out of options"" and then concrete, immediate planning (""about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills""). This is not a rejection of the suicidal thought itself, but rather an expression of internal conflict or despair leading to the decision to act. The immediate and detailed plan overrides any perceived negation.

4.  **Default to Indicator**: Not applicable, as higher risk categories fit.

5.  **Check for Attempt**: There is no description of a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.

Based on the analysis, the post contains clear suicidal ideation combined with specific details of a plan (method, timing, location, and preparatory action). This fits the definition of **Behavior**.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical classification process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   No, the post discusses current thoughts and contemplation, not a past action.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post states: ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round."" This confirms suicidal ideation.
    *   The post also states: ""I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day."" This explicitly mentions ""contemplating method."" According to the definition, a ""plan"" can be a ""method."" While a specific method isn't named, the *active and frequent contemplation* of a method constitutes a component of planning. This goes beyond mere ideation into active consideration of *how* to act. Therefore, this fits the criteria for Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Skipping this step as Behavior was identified, which is a higher risk category). If Behavior wasn't identified, I would check for active suicidal desire without a plan. The phrase ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"" would fit Ideation if no plan element was present.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** (Skipping this step as Behavior was identified). If neither Attempt, Behavior, nor Ideation fit, I would consider Indicator. The user does not negate their suicidal thoughts; they describe them as constant and actively contemplate methods.

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation (""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"") and a component of planning through the active and frequent ""contemplation of method."" This combination classifies it as Behavior.

I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes significant past trauma and medical issues (""I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE"") but does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempts.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post contains suicidal ideation (""I jsut want to die""). Now, I need to check for any elements of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation).
    *   Method: No mention of a specific method.
    *   Timing: No specific timing for a suicidal act is mentioned. The date ""Jan 19th"" refers to a return to a house, not a plan for suicide.
    *   Location: No specific location for a suicidal act is mentioned.
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are described.
    Since there is no plan component, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states, ""I jsut want to die."" This is a clear and active expression of a desire to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The statement ""I jsut want to die"" is a direct expression of desire, not a negated or unwanted thought.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This category is for general distress or negated thoughts. Since there is a clear, active desire to die, it is higher than Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the highest risk level present is Ideation because there is a clear expression of a desire to die without any concrete plan.

I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The user describes *thinking* about an action (""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree""), not a past completed or aborted act. So, it's not an Attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The user expresses suicidal thoughts (""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"").
    *   **Method:** ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" - This is a clear method.
    *   **Timing:** ""right now"" - This indicates immediate contemplation/timing.
    *   **Location:** ""into a tree"" - This specifies a target/location.
    *   Since suicidal thoughts are present along with a specific method, timing, and location, this qualifies as Behavior.
3.  **Hierarchy Rule:** Behavior is the highest risk category identified.

355,"I did a horrible thing to the woman I love. We started off a bit complicated, my mum is dying from cancer and at the start I told her that I cant commit to a relationship because I wasn't in the right headspace. That was fine at first but she wanted more and so did i. But I was weak and looked for comfort in an ex. I put a stop to it again and again but everytime something got hard with my family I kept running to the other woman for support. I knew it was wrong and I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much. We were together for two years. But she found out about the previous incident and left. I am fully responsible for everything that happened. Im so regretful and sorry for hurting her. My mum is in her final couple of weeks, im her primary carer and I dont know how to process any of it. She will be leaving my little brother who is autistic in my care. I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously. I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user's post contains several elements that need to be evaluated against the risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post mentions ""once my mum passes I will be joining her as well"" and ""all the pain I will cause with my passing."" While ""once my mum passes"" provides a conditional timing, the phrasing ""joining her as well"" and ""my passing"" in this context (following previous suicide struggles) is more indicative of a desired outcome or expectation of death by suicide rather than a concrete, actionable plan (method, specific timing, location, or preparation). It doesn't describe *how* they would join her. So, it doesn't clearly fit the 'Behavior' criteria based on a concrete plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   ""I dont see any future ahead for me."" - Expresses hopelessness.
    *   ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well."" - This is a clear expression of a desire/expectation to die, specifically by suicide, given the context.
    *   ""I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing"" - ""My passing"" here, in context, refers to their own death by suicide.
    These phrases clearly indicate an active suicidal desire, moving it beyond 'Indicator' to at least 'Ideation'.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating their suicidal thoughts; they are expressing them as a fear/expectation/desire.

4.  **Check for Past Attempt (Attempt?):** The post explicitly states: ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."" Being hospitalized for struggling with suicide strongly implies a past suicide attempt. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt."" The crucial rule is: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""

**Conclusion based on Hierarchy Rule:**
The post contains a clear indication of a past suicide attempt (""I was hospitalised for it previously"") and also current suicidal ideation (""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well,"" ""all the pain I will cause with my passing""). According to the hierarchy rule, if a post mentions a past attempt *and* current ideation/plans, it is classified as 'Attempt'.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Suicidal thoughts + Plan):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, phrases like ""I wake up even more tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" clearly indicate a desire to end their current state of suffering, which, in context, points to ending their life.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
        *   Method: Not explicitly mentioned.
        *   Timing: The phrase ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" strongly implies an imminent and decided timeframe for action. While not a specific date, it conveys urgency and a narrow window before an intended action. This constitutes a timing element.
        *   Location: Not mentioned.
        *   Preparation: Not mentioned.
    *   Because there is clear suicidal ideation (""tired of living,"" ""stop it"") and a component of planning (the implied imminent timing in ""I don't have much time left""), this post fits the 'Behavior' category. The ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" is a crucial phrase indicating a decision to act and an impending timeline.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** While the post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive (""tired of living""), the presence of the timing element (""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"") elevates it beyond mere ideation. If that phrase were absent, it might be Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not rejecting or negating their suicidal thoughts; rather, they are expressing a strong desire to end their suffering and hinting at an impending action. This is not an 'Indicator'.

Based on the presence of suicidal ideation and a clear, albeit vague, timing component (""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it""), the highest risk category present is Behavior.

357,"I don't want to anymore. I hate cooking, I hate cleaning, I hate taking care of myself, all I have the desire to do is make money to pay my bills and maybe see my friends every once in a while. I used to have dreams and all that good shit and I thought this would never happen to me. But I tried making some art and I just got tired and exhausted when it ended up like shit. I used to love making shit. I used to love trying and experimenting and wasting time because it wasn't a waste to me. But capitalism and instant gratification has irreparably fucked up my brain.

All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide and be depressed. Would've been better for me to not be here at all.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process:

1.  **Check for Attempt**: Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, there is no mention of any past actions.

2.  **Check for Behavior**: Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? The post mentions ""constantly contemplate suicide"" and ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all,"" indicating suicidal thoughts/desire. However, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation**: Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The phrase ""All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide and be depressed"" explicitly states the user is contemplating suicide.
    *   The phrase ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" clearly expresses a desire for non-existence, which is a form of desiring to not be alive.
    *   These phrases go beyond general distress and indicate an active desire or contemplation of ending one's life. There is no negation of these thoughts. The user states they ""hope I'll get out of this soon. But maybe I won't. And that's life too,"" which shows resignation but not a rejection of the suicidal thoughts themselves. This fits the definition of Ideation.

4.  **Check for Indicator**: If none of the above, does the post express general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die, or does it mention suicidal thoughts that are clearly rejected?
    *   The post *does* express general distress and hopelessness (""I don't want to anymore,"" ""I don't know anything anymore"").
    *   However, it *also* explicitly states ""constantly contemplate suicide"" and ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all,"" which are stronger than general distress and indicate a personal, active desire for non-existence or suicidal thoughts.
    *   Crucially, the user does *not* reject these thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't actually want to""). Therefore, it is more severe than an Indicator.

Based on the hierarchy and definitions, the presence of explicit contemplation of suicide and a desire for non-existence (""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"") without a plan, places this post in the Ideation category.

The user is asking for a classification of the suicide risk level. I need to follow the provided hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   Does the post mention a method? No.
    *   Does it mention timing? No.
    *   Does it mention a location? No.
    *   Does it mention preparation? No.
    *   Since there is no element of a plan, it is not ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   The phrases ""When to know if suicide is better"" and ""if anyone else feels like the release is better as their life is a bust"" directly express a contemplation and desire for suicide as a solution or a preferable state. This indicates an active desire to not be alive or to die, as the user is weighing the benefits of ""release"" through suicide against their current life. This fits the definition of Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   The user is *asking* if suicide is better and if others feel ""the release is better,"" which implies they are considering it as a valid option, not rejecting an intrusive thought. They are seeking validation for this idea. Therefore, the thoughts are not negated.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since it fits ""Ideation"" and the thoughts are not negated, it does not default to ""Indicator.""

**Final Classification Reasoning:** The post expresses a clear contemplation and desire for suicide (""When to know if suicide is better,"" ""the release is better"") as a solution to their suffering, without detailing any specific plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of ""Ideation.""

The user expresses a clear desire to die (""I wanna go sleep forever can't take this shit no more I'm sick and tired of my shitty life"").
The post also mentions having a specific quantity of medication: ""I have 58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg"". This constitutes a clear method and implies preparation.
According to the definitions, the presence of suicidal ideation combined with a method/preparation falls under the 'Behavior' category.
It is not an 'Attempt' as it describes current intent and means, not a past action.
It is stronger than 'Ideation' because a specific method/means is mentioned.
It is stronger than 'Indicator' because there is a clear desire to die and a method.
Therefore, the highest risk category present is Behavior.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post states ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive,"" which are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, weapon), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""), location (e.g., ""bridge""), or preparatory action (e.g., ""writing a note,"" ""saying goodbye"").
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The post explicitly states: ""I want to die."" and ""I'm tired of being alive.""
    *   These phrases directly convey a clear, active desire to die or no longer be alive.
    *   This fits the definition of 'ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   The user's statements (""I want to die,"" ""I'm tired of being alive"") are presented as their own feelings and desires, not as intrusive thoughts they are rejecting (e.g., there's no ""but I don't actually want to"").
    *   Therefore, it is not 'indicator' based on negated thoughts.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post clearly expresses an active suicidal desire (Ideation), it does not default to 'indicator'.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear desire to die without any component of a plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation'.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly states, ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times. I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This describes past actions of self-harm or suicide attempts. According to the definition, ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts... The focus is on the past action."" This sentence directly fits the ""Attempt"" category.

2.  **Hierarchy Rule:** The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories (e.g., a past attempt and current plans), you must classify it as the highest risk category present.""
    *   The post describes past attempts (""I have tried... I tried with a knife."") -> **Attempt**
    *   It also describes current planning elements (""I have a rope. I never checked out the place. There's a building..."") -> **Behavior**
    *   And current ideation (""I don't want to bail out anymore... I have to do it. I should've done it a long time ago. I hate myself so much. I want this to end..."") -> **Ideation**

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses a desire to ""end it,"" but does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The phrase ""i just want to end it"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to end one's life. This is an active suicidal desire.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is expressing their own desire (""I just want to end it""), not an intrusive thought they are rejecting.

1. **Check for an Attempt:** The post describes a current desire and a plan, not a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2. **Check for Behavior:**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** The post explicitly states, ""I am looking for someone to kill me"" and ""I am happy for u to chop me up,"" which clearly indicates a strong desire to die.
    *   **Plan Elements:**
        *   **Method:** The user is actively seeking a method by asking someone to kill them (""looking for someone to kill me,"" ""chop me up""). This is a clear method.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I am looking for someone to kill me"" is a preparatory action, as the user is actively seeking assistance to carry out the act.
        *   **Location/Outcome:** ""hide my body so that my family will never find out"" specifies an outcome related to the body's location, which is a form of planning for the aftermath.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation combined with elements of a plan (seeking a method, seeking assistance, specifying an outcome for the body), this fits the definition of 'behavior'.

3. **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** While there is strong ideation, the presence of planning elements elevates it beyond just ideation.

4. **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is expressing a clear desire and plan, not rejecting intrusive thoughts.

5. **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk categories are present.

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post describes a long-term struggle with suicidal thoughts (""fighting down suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death"") but does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. So, not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post mentions ""fantasizing about my death"" and ""some days I consider it"" (referring to acting on the thoughts), which indicates suicidal thoughts are present. However, there is no mention of a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. So, not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The user states ""Every fucking day, something just snaps on in my head and then I'm fantasizing about my death."" and ""some days I consider it."" These phrases could suggest ideation. However, the user explicitly states, ""I have no desire to die."" This statement directly negates an active, personal desire to die, which is a requirement for 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user describes fighting these thoughts (""I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts,"" ""I fight to suppress them""). They explicitly state, ""I have no desire to die."" This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator' where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them (e.g., intrusive or unwanted thoughts). The ""fantasizing"" and ""considering it"" are presented as something they are battling against and are ""fed up with,"" rather than an active desire to pursue.

5.  **Default to Indicator?** Based on the explicit negation of desire (""I have no desire to die"") and the description of fighting against these thoughts, the post fits the 'Indicator' category, as it describes general distress and mental health struggles with suicidal thoughts that are unwanted and rejected.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and category definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt, aborted or otherwise. So, not Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior**: The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""I just really wish to end my life,"" ""I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this""). However, it does *not* mention any specific plan components (method, timing, location, or preparation). The user explicitly states, ""The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest. I don't know why, but I just. can't."" This confirms a lack of a plan and also a perceived inability to act, which prevents it from being classified as Behavior. So, not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The post clearly expresses an active desire to die or end one's life: ""I just really wish to end my life,"" and ""I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this."" This indicates a personal, active desire to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: Before finalizing on Ideation, I need to check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they *do not agree with or want*. The prompt's example for Indicator is ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to.""
    In the current post, the user states, ""I just really wish to end my life, but I just can't."" And later, ""I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this. The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest. I don't know why, but I just. can't.""
    The user is expressing a *personal desire* to end their life (""I just really wish to,"" ""I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this""). They are not stating that these are intrusive thoughts they don't agree with or want. Instead, they are expressing a *desire* coupled with an *inability* to act on it. The negation is about the *capability* to act, not a rejection of the *desire* itself. Since the personal, active desire to die is present and not rejected as unwanted, it fits the definition of Ideation more closely than Indicator. The ""I can't"" part describes a barrier to action, not a lack of the desire itself.

Based on the hierarchy, Ideation is the highest risk level present.

367,I lost control. I've lost control of my head I just want to cry I can't breathe I want to scream help please I don't want to live this again,0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post: ""I lost control. I've lost control of my head I just want to cry I can't breathe I want to scream help please I don't want to live this again"".

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post expresses intense distress (""I lost control,"" ""I can't breathe,"" ""I want to scream help"") and a desire to escape (""I don't want to live this again""), but it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for ending their life. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" strongly conveys a desire to no longer continue living in their current state. This goes beyond general distress and indicates a personal desire to escape life, aligning with the definition of ""desire to no longer be alive or to die."" It's an active rejection of continued existence under current circumstances.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they are rejecting or stating they don't want to act on. The statement ""I don't want to live this again"" is a direct expression of their own desire.
5.  **Default to Indicator?** No, because an active desire to not live is present.

Based on the hierarchy, since there's an active desire to not live (""I don't want to live this again"") but no plan, the classification is Ideation.

368,It's too hard. This is too hard I want to tell them everything not in writing but on the phone so they can hear the sincerity of my voice. My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex. It's this fucking sickness god it's horrible it's so goddamn horrible and I don't why this is happening to me. Of course I get my ex doesn't care about me and didn't care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isn't just my problem my trauma it's this sickness I've been carrying from before I even met her. And I'm tired because I'm a good person I know it's wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesn't listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post based on the given hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The definition for ""Attempt"" states: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts... The focus is on the past action.""
    *   The post contains the sentence: ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it.""
    *   ""I left a note"" is a past tense action.
    *   ""Explaining exactly why I decided this is it"" strongly indicates that ""this is it"" refers to ending their life, and the note was a suicide note.
    *   Leaving a suicide note is a concrete, past preparatory action directly linked to a decision to die. This aligns with the ""Attempt"" category, which covers past actions related to suicide, including significant preparatory steps for a past decision to end one's life.
    *   According to the hierarchy rule: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Even if the post also expresses current distress or ideation, the mention of this past action elevates it to ""Attempt.""

Since ""Attempt"" is the highest risk category and a clear indicator is present, I will classify it as Attempt.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post mentions ""Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die,"" which is past ideation, not a past attempt. It also mentions being ""fired for being suicidal,"" which implies past ideation or behavior, but not a described physical attempt. There is no description of a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express active suicidal desire? Yes, ""I just. Want. To die."" ""I don't want to be a burden anymore."" ""What's the point of life when you can't even carry your own weight?"" These are clear expressions of a desire to die.
    *   Does it include any component of planning (method, timing, location, or preparation)? The post asks, ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" This is a direct inquiry about a *method* and a specific desired outcome related to that method (not leaving a body). This constitutes a component of planning or seeking information for a plan.

Since there is clear suicidal ideation and a component of planning (inquiry about method/outcome), the post falls into the ""Behavior"" category.

3.  **Hierarchy Rule:** ""Behavior"" is the highest risk category identified.

I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy. My view of the world is growing more and more dim and I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and then select the appropriate category.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for mentions of method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   Method: The post does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, rope, weapon). Phrases like ""One last push is all I need"" are metaphorical for an end, not a concrete method.
    *   Timing: No specific time is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""tomorrow,"" ""at 21"").
    *   Location: No specific location is mentioned.
    *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are described (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    *   Conclusion: The post does *not* contain elements of a concrete plan. Therefore, it is not ""Behavior"" based on a plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   ""No point in it all."" - Indicates hopelessness.
    *   ""I need something to really push me over the edge."" - This strongly implies a desire for an active end to life/suffering.
    *   ""I wasn't meant for this world."" - Expresses a feeling of not belonging in life.
    *   ""I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is."" - Questions the value of continuing to live.
    *   ""I don't really see a future for myself."" - Lack of future vision, often linked to suicidal thoughts.
    *   ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" - This is a very direct and strong expression of a desire to actively end suffering and achieve non-existence (""eternal void""), explicitly stating a preference for an active end over a natural one.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, the post clearly expresses an active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   There are no phrases indicating rejection of these thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't actually want to,"" ""intrusive thoughts""). The thoughts expressed are presented as the user's own feelings and desires.
    *   Conclusion: This is not an ""Indicator"" based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not reached because active suicidal desire was identified.

5.  **Hierarchy Rule & Final Classification:**
    *   The post does not describe a past ""Attempt.""
    *   The post does not contain a ""plan"" to be classified as ""Behavior.""
    *   The post clearly expresses an active ""Ideation"" (desire to die/end life) without negating it.
    *   The post goes beyond general distress, making it more severe than ""Indicator.""

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear and active desire to end life (""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally"") but lacks any specific planning elements. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt by the user.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not express any suicidal thoughts *and* a component of planning (method, timing, location, or preparation) by the user. It discusses suicide in a general sense.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post does not explicitly express a personal desire to no longer be alive or to die. It discusses the *reasons* why people commit suicide, using ""we"" in a general, empathetic sense, but not expressing a personal intent or desire to die. Phrases like ""People who commit suicide are not weak"" and ""we've bottled everything up"" are commentary on the subject, not a personal declaration of suicidal desire.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The post discusses suicide thematically and the emotional pain that can lead to it. It shows general distress or discusses suicide thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die. It does not contain negated thoughts, but it fits the broader definition of discussing the topic without personal intent.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It discusses a hypothetical future action (""If I kill myself"").
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""If I kill myself,"" ""leave this world forever""), but it does not mention any specific plan elements:
    *   **Method:** No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon) is mentioned.
    *   **Timing:** No specific timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is mentioned.
    *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye) are mentioned.
    Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly expresses a desire to end one's life or to die. Phrases like ""If I kill myself"" and ""before I leave this world forever"" clearly indicate a personal, active desire to no longer be alive.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting these thoughts. They are expressing them as a potential future action with a specific rationale.
Based on this, the post fits the definition of Ideation, as it expresses a clear desire to die without a concrete plan.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will analyze the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to suicide.
    *   The post states: ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live."" This expresses a desire to not be alive.
    *   The post states: ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" This indicates an expectation or desire to be dead in the future.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), a precise timing for an *act* (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""when I get home""), a specific location, or any preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye). The ""in five years"" is a distant future outlook, not a plan for an immediate or specific suicidal act.
    *   Therefore, the post does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will check if the post expresses a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live."" - This is a direct and active expression of a desire to not be alive.
    *   ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" - This is a clear statement of an expectation or desire to be dead.
    *   These phrases go beyond general sadness and indicate a personal, active desire to not exist.
    *   Therefore, the post meets the criteria for Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   There are no phrases like ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to"" or similar negations of the suicidal thoughts/desires. The statements are presented as the user's own feelings and outlook.
    *   Therefore, the post does not fit the specific criteria for Indicator (where thoughts are rejected).

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is only applied if none of the above categories fit. Since Ideation fits, I will not default to Indicator.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   No past attempt is described (not Attempt).
*   No concrete plan elements are present (not Behavior).
*   Active suicidal desire is clearly expressed (""tired of having to live,"" ""Dead"" in five years) (fits Ideation).
*   The suicidal thoughts are not negated or rejected (not Indicator based on rejection criteria).

Based on the presence of a clear, active desire to not be alive and an expectation of death, without any planning elements, the appropriate classification is Ideation.

374,⚠️TW⚠️ (I think) Question. If someone wants to kill their self for what ever reason Maybe to end their pain why do people stop them?. (No hate). (Asking for a personal reason),0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It's a question. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post asks ""If someone wants to kill their self... why do people stop them?"". While it discusses suicidal thoughts (""wants to kill their self"" to ""end their pain""), it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. It's a general question, not a plan. So, it's not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post uses the phrase ""If someone wants to kill their self for what ever reason Maybe to end their pain"". The crucial part is ""(Asking for a personal reason)"". This transforms a hypothetical question into one that strongly implies the user is personally grappling with suicidal thoughts and desires to end their pain through suicide. The question ""why do people stop them?"" further indicates a personal contemplation of this desire and the obstacles to it. This goes beyond general distress and directly expresses a personal engagement with the desire to die, even if phrased indirectly as a question. It's not negated.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. Instead, they are questioning *why* people stop someone who *wants* to kill themselves, implying a personal connection to that desire. Therefore, it's not 'Indicator' based on negation.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** The post is not merely general distress or mental health struggles. The direct reference to ""kill their self"" and ""end their pain"" combined with ""Asking for a personal reason"" indicates a personal, active desire or contemplation of suicide, even if phrased as a question. This is stronger than a general indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a personal desire related to ending one's life (""wants to kill their self... to end their pain"") even if phrased as a question, due to the ""personal reason"" clarification. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die, without a concrete plan.

The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""So remember when I was 10 or 11 I came home from school... I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning since it was pretty deep and I didn't know how to swim. So some how she convince me not to."" This describes a past instance where the user contemplated and moved towards a suicidal act but was stopped or stopped themselves. This fits the definition of an ""aborted attempt"" which falls under the ""Attempt"" category.
    The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post clearly has current plans and ideation as well.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post states, ""suicide by a train is on my mind. I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday 🥳. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"". This clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""suicide by a train is on my mind"") and includes a plan:
    *   Method: ""suicide by a train"", ""put neck on the train tracks""
    *   Timing: ""on my 18th birthday""
    This would classify as Behavior if there wasn't a past attempt.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The phrase ""suicide by a train is on my mind"" expresses a clear desire to not be alive, which would fit Ideation if no plan or attempt were present.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** This category is not applicable as there is clear active suicidal desire, planning, and a description of a past aborted attempt.

**Final Classification Decision:**
Based on the hierarchy rule, since the post describes a past aborted attempt (""I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning... So some how she convince me not to"") and also contains current plans and ideation, the highest risk category is Attempt.

I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, it mentions ""an attempt of someone else"" and ""suicidal thoughts through my life,"" but no personal past attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior**: Does the post include suicidal ideation AND a component of planning (method, timing, location, preparation)? The post states ""opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try,"" which indicates a *consideration* or *increased receptiveness* to the idea of suicide, but it does not articulate any specific plan (method, time, location, or preparatory act). Therefore, it is not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation**: Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die? The post mentions ""I keep thinking about it"" and ""opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try."" This suggests the thoughts are present and the concept of suicide feels more ""real"" or permissible. However, the crucial sentence is ""But I just don´t want to think like this anymore."" This negates the desire to continue having these thoughts or to act on them. It's a struggle *with* the thoughts, not an expression of active desire to die.

4.  **Check for Indicator**: Does the post show general distress, hopelessness, or discuss suicide thematically, *or* does the user mention suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them? The post clearly states ""I just don´t want to think like this anymore,"" which is an explicit rejection of the suicidal thoughts. The user is expressing distress *about* having these thoughts, not a desire to fulfill them. This fits the definition of Indicator, specifically the part about negating unwanted thoughts.

Based on the hierarchy and the explicit negation of the thoughts, the highest risk category is Indicator.

The user post is ""Stop please. I can't even do work, be productive, stay hydrated without having intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions, rage outbursts, followed by depressive episodes just want my life to end"".

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a desire (""just want my life to end"") but does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""just want my life to end"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to die or no longer be alive. This fits the definition of Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Although the user mentions ""intrusive thoughts"" earlier, the concluding phrase ""just want my life to end"" is a clear statement of personal desire, not a thought they are rejecting or do not agree with. It's an active desire. Therefore, it is not an Indicator due to negation.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not reached as Ideation was identified.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   No past attempt mentioned.
*   No plan mentioned, so not Behavior.
*   Clear active desire to end life (""just want my life to end""), which falls under Ideation.
*   The desire is not negated, so it's not Indicator.

Based on the hierarchy and definitions, the most appropriate classification is Ideation.

378,"not sure what to call this-. i don't know how to describe it, but it feels like i disassociate sometimes. granted, it could just be adhd stuff along with a part of my extreme dysphoria and never feeling like i'm the person i appear as; but, it doesn't feel like i'm in my body. like i'm simply watching someone work and live while i only watch. when others call for me or start conversations, it's like i'm not a part of it. i can't fully think when i talk or write, like i act without my own permission. i feel so disconnected from life in itself already, to the point where my emotions never act how i want. even when it came to serious topics such as my dog's passing or nearly killing myself one night, i don't feel really anything for it. i just sit there and watch people express themselves, not knowing what to do. when i see others sad or stressed, i can't feel the same or help. everything seems so far out of my touch, like it's not even real at some times. i can write things down or do something earlier that day, only to feel as if it were fake or like i wasn't actually doing it/there. this doesn't held that i lucid dream so often that, when i wake back up, real life feels more as a dream than my actual dreams. i zone out fairly often to the point of not realizing where i am or what i was doing prior. i want to talk to a therapist about it, but i have no money nor insurance to talk to one. not like i'd even trust a therapist fully with how trashy past ones have treated me. and i've already caused enough trouble for my parents. all i can do is watch days pass by without me even realizing it. dealing with constant bad moods from my dad, to the point where he throws things at times, and barely seeing my mom as she works. it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user post needs to be classified based on the provided suicide risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states: ""even when it came to serious topics such as my dog's passing or nearly killing myself one night, i don't feel really anything for it."" This explicitly describes a past event of ""nearly killing myself,"" which falls under the definition of an aborted attempt or a past act of self-harm/suicide attempt. According to the hierarchy rule, if a post mentions a past attempt, it is classified as Attempt, especially if there are also current plans/ideation.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post also mentions a potential future action with a method/location: ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking."" This indicates suicidal ideation with a component of planning (method/location). If this were the only element, it would be classified as Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** The overall tone expresses a desire to escape and a feeling of disconnection, which aligns with suicidal ideation. However, the presence of a past attempt and a future potential method/location elevates the risk.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** The thoughts are not negated; rather, they are expressed as a potential future action or a past event.

**Hierarchy Application:** The post contains a clear description of a past ""nearly killing myself"" event (Attempt) and also expresses current suicidal thoughts with a potential future method/location (Behavior). Per the hierarchy rule, if a post contains elements of multiple categories, it must be classified as the highest risk category present. ""Attempt"" is the highest risk category.

The user is asking for a suicide risk classification for the provided social media post. I need to follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   The post contains the phrase ""i want to take myself out"". This is clear suicidal ideation.
    *   Now, I need to check for a plan (method, timing, location, preparation).
        *   Method: The user states ""i'm scared it'll be painful"". This indicates a *desire* for a method that isn't painful, but no specific method is mentioned or implied as being prepared. The question ""what do i do, please?"" further suggests a lack of a concrete plan.
        *   Timing: No specific timing is mentioned.
        *   Location: No specific location is mentioned.
        *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are mentioned.
    *   Since there is no concrete plan component (method, timing, location, preparation), the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):**
    *   Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   Yes, the phrase ""shits not worth it anymore. not for me."" expresses hopelessness.
    *   ""i need a way out."" expresses a desire to escape.
    *   Crucially, ""i want to take myself out"" is a direct and explicit statement of a desire to end one's life.
    *   ""i just need it to stop."" reinforces this desire for cessation.
    *   This clearly fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):**
    *   Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want? No, the user expresses a personal desire (""I want to take myself out""). The fear of pain is a barrier to action, not a rejection of the desire itself.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses clear suicidal ideation without a concrete plan. Therefore, the classification is 'Ideation'.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses a desire to die (""the more I want to die""), but it does not include any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The phrase ""the more I live the more I want to die"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to die or not be alive. This fits the definition of Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want. The statement ""I want to die"" is presented as a personal desire, not an intrusive thought.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since Ideation is clearly present, it does not default to Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses an active desire to die without a concrete plan, aligning with the Ideation category.

My grades have dropped and they are furious, calling me a failure and a disappointment. I tried to tell them how I've been feeling, as in feeling like a coward and contemplating but they don't care. All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations. That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way. It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone, they'll just have less children to feed, and less bills to pay. I want to die but I'm scared of the consequences of failure.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the prescribed thinking process and then provide the final classification.

1.  **Check for an Attempt**: The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: The post states, ""That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way.""
    *   **Method**: The user is actively ""thinking on how to die painlessly,"" which indicates a search for a method. Even though they haven't *found* a way yet, the sustained, long-term (6+ months) *search* for a method is a clear component of planning or a preparatory action. This is not just a fleeting thought; it's an active engagement with the practicalities of ending their life.
    *   **Timing/Location/Preparation**: No specific timing, location, or other preparatory acts are mentioned, *except* for the ongoing search for a method.
    Since there is an active search for a method (a component of a plan), and clear suicidal ideation, this points towards 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: Yes, the post explicitly states, ""I want to die."" This is a clear expression of a desire to no longer be alive.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user does not negate their suicidal thoughts. They express a direct desire to die and are actively thinking about how to achieve it.

**Hierarchy Rule Application**:
The post contains:
*   ""I want to die"" -> This is Ideation.
*   ""for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way."" -> This indicates an active search for a method, which is a component of planning.

Since the post contains both suicidal ideation and a component of planning (searching for a method), it falls under the 'Behavior' category, as per the definition: ""The post includes both suicidal ideation and a component of planning. A plan can be a method... The presence of any of these, even if vague, elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior."" The ongoing search for a method, even if unsuccessful so far, is a concrete action related to planning.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. It mentions thinking about killing oneself for 5 years, but no past action.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses clear suicidal ideation (""Must end this shit show,"" ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop,"" ""I'm very OVER this shit""). It also mentions a preparatory action: ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it. I don't want to wuss out and then regret sending them."" Sending goodbye emails before an intended act constitutes preparation, which is a component of a plan.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** While there is strong ideation, the presence of a preparatory action (""emails to send"") elevates the risk beyond just ideation.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not negating their suicidal thoughts; rather, they are expressing a desire to go through with it (""I don't want to wuss out"").

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of suicidal ideation combined with a preparatory action (sending goodbye emails) classifies this post as Behavior.

The user is expressing clear suicidal ideation with the phrase ""Ending it soon.""
Next, I check for a plan. The post states, ""I ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here.""
This explicitly mentions a method (dextromethorphan), a quantity (""14 grams,"" ""taking it all""), and a timing (""as soon as it gets here""). Ordering the substance is also a preparatory action.
The presence of ideation (""Ending it soon"") combined with a specific method, timing, and preparation clearly fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
The post does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
The level of detail goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because of the concrete plan elements.
It is not 'Indicator' as there is a clear, active desire to die with a plan, not just general distress or negated thoughts.
Therefore, the highest risk category present is Behavior.

When did Human thought it would be cool living so much?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the prescribed thinking process and then provide the final classification.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: The post does not mention any specific method, timing (other than general lifespan), location, or preparatory actions for ending one's life. It's a philosophical questioning of the value of life and expressing dread about its length, not a plan. So, it's not Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The phrases ""how people can want to live?"", ""how they actually find important to stay alive?"", and the dread expressed about ""60 fucking years left"" (""you guys are telling me I have to live 60 years more?"") strongly indicate a personal lack of desire to continue living.
    *   The user is not just discussing life thematically; they are expressing a profound personal aversion to the prospect of living for many more years, especially given their past negative experiences (""it wasn't really good"").
    *   While it doesn't use explicit phrases like ""I want to die,"" the rhetorical questions and the strong negative sentiment towards continued existence (""60 fucking years left"") convey a clear personal lack of desire to live or a wish to not have to live that long. This aligns with the definition of Ideation: ""explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die,"" even if passively expressed through aversion to life.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they are rejecting or do not want. They are expressing their own genuine lack of desire to live for a long time and questioning the value of life. This is not an intrusive thought scenario.

4.  **Default to Indicator**: This is not general distress. It goes beyond discussing suicide thematically. It's a personal expression of not wanting to live for the expected duration, stemming from a lack of perceived value in life. This is stronger than an Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear aversion to continuing to live for the expected lifespan, stemming from a lack of perceived value in life. This is a form of desiring to no longer be alive, even if not explicitly stated as ""I want to die."" It fits the definition of Ideation more closely than Indicator.

**Hierarchy Check**: No attempt, no behavior. It's between Ideation and Indicator. The strong personal aversion to continuing to live (""60 fucking years left... you guys are telling me I have to live 60 years more?"") and the questioning of the very desire to live (""how people can want to live?"") points to a personal lack of desire for life, which falls under Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt by the user. It is a general commentary.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post discusses the concept of ""suicide by cop"" as a potential outcome for *someone else* who is ""passive suicidal."" It does not state that the *user* has suicidal thoughts *with a plan*. There is no mention of the user's own method, timing, location, or preparation for suicide.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The post does not express a personal desire from the user to not be alive, to die, or to end their life. The user is discussing a hypothetical scenario and offering advice/observation about how others might react. Phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead"" are absent and there is no personal intent.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is not expressing any personal suicidal thoughts, whether negated or not. They are discussing the topic of suicidality in a general, advisory, or observational manner.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since no attempt, behavior, or personal ideation is present, I will default to Indicator. The post discusses suicide thematically (""passive suicidal,"" ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal,"" ""suicide by cop"") but lacks a personal, active desire to die from the user. It's a commentary *about* suicidality, not an expression *of* it by the user.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and risk hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post mentions ""I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens."" This sounds like a medical incident or accidental overdose, not a deliberate suicide attempt. It also states, ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up."" This explicitly negates a past attempt. Therefore, the post does not describe a past suicide attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Suicidal thoughts + Plan):**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** The post contains phrases like ""I had a plan in mind ever since,"" and ""think that might be the way I choose to go."" This clearly indicates an active desire to die.
    *   **Plan Components:**
        *   **Method:** The user explicitly mentions ""insulin pens"" and then ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" via a ""pump"" as a potential method. This is a clear and specific method.
        *   **Timing/Condition:** ""if my condition goes south quick"" provides a conditional timing for the plan.
        *   **Preparation/Accessibility:** ""getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible"" indicates a preferred, accessible method.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation (""think that might be the way I choose to go"") and specific plan components (method: insulin pump, conditional timing: if condition goes south), this post fits the ""Behavior"" category.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Not applicable, as Behavior is a higher risk category and is present).

4.  **Check for Indicator:** (Not applicable, as Behavior is a higher risk category and is present).

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear desire to die and outlines a specific method (insulin pump) and a conditional timing (""if my condition goes south quick""). This combination classifies it as Behavior.

The user post expresses a clear desire to ""kill yourself on your birthday"" and states ""well I do"". This indicates active suicidal ideation.
Next, I check for a plan. The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" combined with the desire to kill themselves on their birthday implies immediate timing and opportunity for the act. ""Right now"" is a specific timeframe, which falls under the definition of a plan component (timing).
Since there is clear suicidal ideation and a component of a plan (timing/opportunity), the classification is Behavior.
It does not describe a past attempt.
It is not merely ideation because of the ""right now"" component.
It is not an indicator because the thoughts are not negated; they are affirmed and acted upon with a sense of immediate possibility.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will analyze the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to suicide. The user states, ""It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide,"" and expresses deep distress and hopelessness (""I don't want to do this anymore,"" ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit""). However, there is no specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""rope""), no specific timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week""), no specific location (e.g., ""bridge,"" ""train tracks""), and no preparatory actions (e.g., ""writing a note,"" ""saying goodbye""). Therefore, this post does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will now check if the post expresses a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life. The phrase ""It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide"" is a direct and explicit statement of contemplating suicide. This indicates an active suicidal desire or contemplation. Other phrases like ""I don't want to do this anymore"" (in context of life/school struggles) and ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit"" further support a profound sense of hopelessness and a questioning of the value of life, aligning with ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I need to determine if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. The user says, ""It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide,"" which describes their feeling about having the thought, but it does not negate the thought itself. They are *considering* it. While they mention, ""I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents,"" this indicates a protective factor preventing action, not a rejection of the suicidal thought itself. The thought is present and being considered. Therefore, this does not fit the ""negated thoughts"" criteria for Indicator.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since active suicidal desire (Ideation) was identified, I will not default to Indicator.

**Final Classification Reasoning:**
The post clearly expresses active suicidal ideation through the explicit statement ""I'm finally considering suicide."" While the user mentions their parents as a reason not to act, this is a protective factor and does not negate the presence of the suicidal thought itself. There is no concrete plan mentioned, nor is there a description of a past attempt. Therefore, the most appropriate classification is Ideation.

The user's post explicitly states, ""I just attempted to end my life."" It further describes physical actions associated with this attempt: ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"" and ""I put down my knife."" The description of being ""right there about to do"" and ""almost committed"" indicates an aborted attempt. According to the provided definitions, the ""Attempt"" category includes past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts, as well as aborted attempts and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting. The presence of bleeding wrists and thighs, along with the description of putting down the knife after being on the verge of acting, clearly fits this definition. Since ""Attempt"" is the highest risk category, and it is explicitly present in the post, no further analysis for lower risk categories is needed.

I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the defined hierarchy and process.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post explicitly states, ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to"". Therefore, it is not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan)**: I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   The post says, ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be."" This indicates a desire but acknowledges difficulty in acting, not a plan.
    *   ""I feel like killing myself."" - This is ideation, not a plan.
    *   ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't."" - This expresses a desire to act if courage were present, but it does not describe a plan. It states the *lack* of ability to act, not a plan for action.
    *   There are no elements of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation) mentioned. Therefore, it is not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)**: I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to"" - This clearly expresses a desire to die.
    *   ""I feel like killing myself."" - This is a direct statement of suicidal ideation.
    *   ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would"" - This is a very strong statement of desire to die, contingent only on having the courage.
    *   The post contains multiple clear expressions of active suicidal desire.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)**: I need to see if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The phrase ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't"" is critical here. The ""but I don't"" refers to the *guts* or *courage* to act, not a negation of the *desire* to die. The user *wants* to die, but feels they lack the courage to do so. This is different from ""My brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to."" The desire is present and active.
    *   The user is not rejecting the suicidal thoughts themselves, but rather their perceived inability to act on them.
    *   Therefore, this does not fit the ""negated thoughts"" criteria for Indicator.

5.  **Default to Indicator**: Since active suicidal desire (Ideation) is clearly present, the post does not default to Indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire to die without any concrete plan. This fits the definition of Ideation.

391,"Last post. I'm ending my life tonight. I'll find a way. I'll stop being a coward finally. If anyone saw my last post it's a continuation.

My fat ass of a guidance councillor was too busy eating chips to check her email and pull me out of the college level class early on. What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail? I got a fifty last term and the only way to pass is to get a 80 this term. That's impossible. Plus I only have a week left. And my parents, mostly mom, are pure evil when it comes to school and mental health. Killing myself is the only escape. I've already written my suicide note and put it on my notes app. I'm gonna just delete everything and just slit my wrists with some scissors when everyone is going to bed. So goodbye everyone. Kinda sad I never got to do anything. Not that I could've anyways.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user post needs to be classified based on the suicide risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes future actions and preparations (""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""I've already written my suicide note,"" ""I'm gonna just delete everything and just slit my wrists""). It does not describe a *past* act of self-harm or a completed/aborted suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** The post clearly expresses a desire to end life: ""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape,"" ""So goodbye everyone.""
    *   **Plan Elements:**
        *   **Method:** ""slit my wrists with some scissors"" - A specific method is mentioned.
        *   **Timing:** ""tonight"", ""when everyone is going to bed"" - Specific timing is mentioned.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I've already written my suicide note and put it on my notes app."" - A preparatory action is explicitly stated.
    Since active suicidal desire is present along with multiple elements of a plan (method, timing, and preparation), the post fits the 'Behavior' category.

3.  **Check for Ideation/Indicator:** These categories are lower in the hierarchy and are not applicable since 'Behavior' has been identified.
</thinking>

The user post states: """"friend"" snitched on me and told family my plan to kill myself. now they're keeping their heads up and watching me. this is like preventing someone to get euthanized. what the fuck.""

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It refers to a ""plan"" that was revealed, not an attempt that occurred. So, it is not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself."" The presence of a ""plan"" (even if the details of the plan are not provided in this specific post) indicates that suicidal thoughts are accompanied by a component of planning. The user is frustrated that this plan was revealed and is now being prevented. This directly fits the definition of 'behavior' because it includes suicidal ideation (""kill myself"") and a component of planning (""my plan"").

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The post clearly expresses a desire to die by mentioning ""my plan to kill myself"" and comparing prevention to ""euthanized."" However, since a ""plan"" is mentioned, 'behavior' is a more severe classification.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is not negating suicidal thoughts; they are expressing frustration that their plan was revealed and they are being prevented from acting on it. Therefore, it is not 'indicator'.

**Hierarchy Rule:** Since the post contains elements of a plan (""my plan to kill myself""), it falls under 'behavior', which is higher in severity than 'ideation' or 'indicator'.
</thinking>

Final Classification: behavior",behavior,True
393,Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children and then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now. I hope my baby ends up safe,2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user post states, ""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children and then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now. I hope my baby ends up safe.""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The post expresses clear suicidal thoughts: ""im gonna kill myself.""
    *   It mentions a specific timing: ""3 weeks from now.""
    *   It describes preparatory actions: ""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children."" This indicates a period of withdrawal and preparation before the stated act.
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and elements of a plan (timing and preparation) are present, the category is Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This is present (""im gonna kill myself""), but the presence of a plan elevates it beyond Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating their thoughts; they are stating a clear intention and plan.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk categories fit.

5.  **Hierarchy Check:**
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempt is described.
    *   **Behavior:** Yes, clear suicidal intent with a specific timeframe and preparatory actions. This is the highest risk category present.
    *   **Ideation:** The post goes beyond mere ideation due to the planning elements.
    *   **Indicator:** The post is far more severe than an indicator.

Therefore, the post falls under the Behavior category.

Final Classification: behavior",behavior,True
394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It's a hypothetical question about a potential future action.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):**
    *   **Suicidal Thoughts/Desire:** The phrase ""Would this kill me"" in the context of listing multiple medications and alcohol strongly implies an active desire to die or an intent to use these substances to end one's life. It's not a neutral medical inquiry.
    *   **Method:** The post explicitly lists specific substances and quantities: ""Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol."" This constitutes a very concrete and detailed method.
    *   **Timing/Location/Preparation:** While not explicitly stated, the detailed method is sufficient to classify this as having a plan component.

Since there is clear suicidal ideation (implied by ""Would this kill me"" in this context) and a specific, detailed method (listing substances and quantities), this meets the criteria for ""Behavior."" The user is inquiring about the lethality of a specific combination of means, which indicates a component of planning.

However, recently I've been thinking of doing it in a way that doesn't looks like suicide. Like a car accident or something. I'll get what I want without fucking up anyone's mental health.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post describes future plans (""How I'm planning to end it,"" ""thinking of doing it""), not a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""How I'm planning to end it,"" ""thinking of doing it,"" ""I'll get what I want."" This clearly indicates a desire to die.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan? Yes.
        *   **Method:** ""doing it in a way that doesn't looks like suicide. Like a car accident or something."" This specifies a method (a car accident).
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and a specific method mentioned, this fits the definition of ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** (This step is superseded by Behavior, but for a full thought process) The post clearly expresses a desire to end one's life.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is actively planning and considering methods, not rejecting intrusive thoughts. So, it's not ""Indicator.""

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""How I'm planning to end it"") and a specific method (""Like a car accident or something""). This combination classifies it as ""Behavior.""

Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in.

She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post expresses extreme distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden and a failure. However, it does *not* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) related to ending one's life. The failures mentioned are related to life goals (jobs, driving lessons), not suicidal actions.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post uses phrases like ""I'm a complete lost cause,"" ""constantly stuck,"" ""never had any skills that are useful,"" ""constant burden,"" ""always going to fail everything I want to do."" While these indicate severe distress and hopelessness, they do *not* explicitly express a desire to die, to not be alive, or to end one's life (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I'm going to die soon""). The focus is on being a failure in life, not on wanting to end life.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts:** The post does not mention suicidal thoughts that are then rejected or stated as unwanted.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post describes general distress, hopelessness, self-blame, and mental health struggles without a stated desire to die or any suicidal planning, it falls into the Indicator category.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post does not express any suicidal thoughts or a desire to die, therefore it cannot contain a plan (method, timing, location, preparation). The user is seeking connection to alleviate distress, not planning an act.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The post expresses feelings of being ""like shit,"" ""depressed,"" and ""fucking sad,"" and a need to talk to feel ""less alone."" However, it does not explicitly state a desire to die, to not be alive, or to end their life (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I'm going to end it all""). The intent is to alleviate current distress through connection, not to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they then reject.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since no attempt, behavior, or explicit ideation is present, and the post expresses general distress, loneliness, and mental health struggles without a stated desire to die, it falls into the Indicator category.

Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of.

I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The post states: ""I wrote a note today.""
    *   According to the definition, ""Preparation: Describing preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye)"" is a component of a plan.
    *   Therefore, a plan component is present.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   The post contains phrases like: ""I'm at the end of my rope,"" ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more,"" ""lately it feels like I just can't continue.""
    *   These phrases clearly express a desire to no longer be alive or an inability to continue living, which constitutes active suicidal desire/ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   The user is not negating their thoughts; they are expressing them as their current state and struggle.

4.  **Default to Indicator:**
    *   Not applicable, as higher risk elements are present.

5.  **Hierarchy Check (Most to Least Severe):**
    *   **Attempt:** The post mentions an ER visit and transport to another hospital after reaching out for help. However, it does not explicitly describe a *past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt* by the user. It describes a crisis intervention *after* reaching out, not necessarily an attempt itself. The prompt's definition for Attempt is ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt."" The ER visit is a consequence of a crisis, not a direct report of an attempt.
    *   **Behavior:** The post clearly contains both active suicidal ideation (""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more"") and a component of planning (""I wrote a note today,"" which is a preparatory act). This fits the definition of Behavior.
    *   Since ""Behavior"" is clearly present and ""Attempt"" is not explicitly described by the user as their past action, ""Behavior"" is the highest applicable risk category.

Final Classification based on the presence of suicidal ideation and a preparatory action (writing a note).

399,Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user post is: ""Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not describe a *future* plan (method, timing, location, preparation). It describes past actions. So, it's not Behavior based on a *future* plan.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post states ""Tried to end my life again."" This implies a past desire to die, but the core of the statement is about a *past action* taken to fulfill that desire.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating thoughts; they are describing past actions.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** This is clearly more severe than general distress.

Now, let's apply the hierarchy and definitions, especially focusing on the ""Attempt"" category.

*   **Attempt Definition:** ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts... The focus is on the past action.""
*   The phrase ""Tried to end my life again"" directly describes a past action that was an attempt to end their life. The ""didn't work"" part indicates it was an unsuccessful or aborted attempt.
*   This fits the ""Attempt"" definition perfectly.
*   According to the hierarchy, ""Attempt"" is the most severe category. If a post contains elements of multiple categories, I must classify it as the highest risk category present.

Therefore, the classification is Attempt.

I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will scan the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to ending one's life. The post details a long history of medical symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments for a concussion, expressing frustration and hopelessness. There is no mention of any suicidal plan.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for phrases indicating a desire to die, such as ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I want to end it all."" The user states, ""Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much."" While ""hopeless"" indicates significant distress, it does not explicitly express a desire to die or to no longer be alive. It describes a feeling of being stuck and overwhelmed, not a wish for death.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Since no suicidal thoughts were expressed, this step is not applicable.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and struggles with ongoing health issues and ineffective treatments. It clearly falls under ""general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.""

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post contains strong expressions of desiring death (""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat""), but it does not describe any *past action* taken by the user. Therefore, it is not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   The post explicitly states: ""I have no plans"".
    *   While it mentions methods of dying (""a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""stomp me out,"" ""slit my fucking throat""), these are phrased as desires for *external* action upon them (""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat""), rather than *their own* plan to execute. The user's explicit statement ""I have no plans"" directly contradicts the requirement for a ""plan"" in the ""Behavior"" category, which refers to the user's own intent and preparation. Therefore, it is not ""Behavior.""

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   Yes, the post contains multiple clear and strong expressions of a desire to die:
        *   ""I deserve to die.""
        *   ""I just deserve to be dead.""
        *   ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head.""
        *   ""I want someone to stomp me out like the flaming turd that I am.""
        *   ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot.""
    *   These phrases demonstrate a clear and active desire for death.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   No, the user is not negating these thoughts. They explicitly state they *deserve* to die and *wish* for it. Phrases like ""I deserve to die"" and ""I want someone to stomp me out"" show agreement with the desire, not rejection of intrusive thoughts. Therefore, it is not ""Indicator.""

**Final Classification based on Hierarchy:**
*   Not Attempt (no past action).
*   Not Behavior (explicitly states ""I have no plans,"" and methods mentioned are desires for external action, not personal plans).
*   It clearly expresses an active, personal desire to die without negation. This fits the definition of ""Ideation.""

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?)**:
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I'm only alive by obligation,"" and ""But the second they're gone, so am I.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
        *   ""But the second they're gone, so am I."" This specifies a *timing* or a specific future condition for the act. It's a clear statement of intent linked to a future event. This fits the definition of a plan component (timing).

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**:
    *   ""I'm only alive by obligation"" implies a desire not to be alive.
    *   ""But the second they're gone, so am I"" is a direct statement of intent to die.
    *   If there were no plan, this would be Ideation. However, the presence of a timing element elevates it.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user is not rejecting or negating these thoughts; they are stated as their own intention.

5.  **Default to Indicator**: Not applicable as there are stronger elements.

**Conclusion based on Hierarchy**:
The post contains clear suicidal ideation (""I'm only alive by obligation,"" ""so am I"") and a component of planning, specifically a conditional timing (""the second they're gone""). According to the hierarchy, the presence of a plan elevates the risk to 'Behavior'.

I'm talking to some friends now. not about them or anything, just random stuff. it's helping, but I'm just lying here wondering if I should tell them. every conversation I have with them these days, I'm just thinking ""this might be our last conversation"". during our dnd sessions, I'm thinking it could be my last. then I read this post on tumblr about the aftermath of suicide on people left behind and I started crying. and there's four friends in particular I'd be worried about and I can't help but think about them and hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them and my sibling. and now it's just a guilty downward spiral but I can't do much about it right now, and I don't want to worry any of my friends by telling them how bad it is, like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad. I don't know what I want anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user is expressing significant distress and suicidal thoughts. I need to go through the hierarchy to classify the risk level.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It mentions ""bad urges"" and ""self destructive ones,"" but not an actual past action. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan + Ideation):**
    *   **Suicidal Ideation:** The user clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""I'm just thinking 'this might be our last conversation',"" ""during our dnd sessions, I'm thinking it could be my last,"" ""hate myself for thinking of killing myself."" This is active suicidal desire.
    *   **Plan:** The user explicitly states, ""I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" While no specific method, timing, or location is detailed, the *admission of having a plan* is a direct indication of planning. The prompt states: ""The presence of any of these, even if vague, elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior."" The explicit mention of ""a plan"" fits this criterion.

    Since both suicidal ideation and a component of planning (the explicit statement of having a plan) are present, the category is 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This is present, but the presence of a plan elevates it to 'Behavior'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user expresses guilt (""hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them and my sibling"") and concern about worrying friends, but they do *not* negate the suicidal thoughts or the plan itself. They are struggling with the thoughts and the plan, not rejecting them as intrusive or unwanted.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher categories fit.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of both active suicidal ideation and the explicit mention of having a plan classifies this post as 'Behavior'.

I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but does not describe any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to ending one's life. Therefore, it is not ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post discusses having ""suicidal thoughts"" and that these thoughts are occurring ""more and more frequently."" It also states, ""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself."" This last phrase conveys profound hopelessness and a feeling of being trapped or overwhelmed by the situation. However, it does *not* explicitly state a direct desire to die, such as ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I want to end it all."" It expresses a struggle to cope and survive, rather than an active wish for death. The primary focus is on the difficulty of discussing these thoughts and the increasing frequency of them.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not explicitly negating the suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't actually want to""). Instead, they are discussing the *presence* and *impact* of these thoughts and the difficulty of seeking help for them. While not negated, the post lacks a clear, active desire to die. The hopelessness expressed (""grave I dug myself"") is about the difficulty of the situation, not a direct desire for death.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post does not describe a past attempt, a concrete plan, or an explicit, active desire to die, it falls into the ""Indicator"" category. It expresses general distress, hopelessness, and discusses the theme of suicidal thoughts (their presence and increasing frequency) without a stated desire to act on them or a clear wish for death. The user is struggling with the thoughts and the situation, but not expressing a direct intent or desire to die.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states ""bullied me into nearly killing myself"". This refers to a past state or contemplation, not a described past *act* of self-harm or an *aborted attempt* (e.g., ""I put the belt around my neck but then stopped""). It implies past severe ideation or being very close to an attempt, but it does not describe a concrete past action that was initiated. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for ""Attempt"" as defined.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   Suicidal thoughts: ""I fucking hate living"" is a strong expression of a desire to not be alive.
    *   Plan: There is no mention of a current method, timing, location, or preparation for ending their life. The ""shooting up the school"" part is a past violent thought directed outwards, not a current suicidal plan for self-harm.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** If not an attempt or behavior, does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   ""I fucking hate living"" directly expresses a strong desire to no longer be alive. This fits the definition of Ideation. It's a clear expression of intent/desire, even if passive in terms of action.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Are the suicidal thoughts expressed, but then rejected or stated they don't want to act on them?
    *   No, the statement ""I fucking hate living"" is not negated. It's a direct expression of distress and a desire for their current state to end.

Based on this analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive (""I fucking hate living"") without any current plan. The mention of ""nearly killing myself"" refers to a past state, not a described past act, and does not elevate it to Attempt. The current active desire is the strongest element.

Final Classification: Ideation.

Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user post describes a past event where they ""Survived OD"" and provides details about swallowing ""120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle."" The user also states, ""I wanted to"" when reflecting on the overdose. This clearly describes a past suicide attempt. According to the classification rules, if a post describes a past suicide attempt, it falls under the 'Attempt' category, which is the highest risk level. Even though the user is processing it now and having thoughts pop up, the core content is about a completed (though survived) past act.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process:

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt (aborted or completed)?
    *   The post does not describe any past actions of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   The post states, ""Suicide has become my quick solution."" This expresses a clear suicidal thought/desire.
    *   However, it does *not* include any specific details about a method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""rope""), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., ""bridge""), or preparatory actions (e.g., ""writing a note""). It frames suicide as a ""solution"" but doesn't outline *how* or *when* this solution would be implemented. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post explicitly express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life, without a concrete plan?
    *   ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all."" This implies a strong desire to escape current circumstances, which, in the context of the rest of the post, points towards ending life.
    *   ""Suicide has become my quick solution."" This is a direct and explicit statement indicating that suicide is considered a personal solution. This clearly expresses a desire for suicide.
    *   These statements show a personal, active desire to die or end life.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Before finalizing on Ideation, does the user express suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want (intrusive thoughts)?
    *   The post does not negate or reject the suicidal thoughts. The statement ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" is presented as a personal conclusion, not an unwanted thought.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   This is not the case, as there is a clear stated desire for suicide.

Based on this analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire for suicide (""Suicide has become my quick solution"") and a desire to ""get away from it all,"" but it lacks any concrete plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to ending one's life.
    *   The post discusses depression, how it makes it ""hard to keep going,"" and its chronic nature. There is no mention of any specific plan (method, timing, location, or preparation).

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post states, ""It makes it hard to keep going."" While this expresses significant distress and difficulty with life, it does not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" It describes the *struggle* of living with depression, not a direct *desire* for death. The user also wonders ""if a long-term cure even exists,"" which, while pessimistic, implies a desire for relief or a cure, not necessarily death.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user mentions suicidal thoughts but explicitly rejects them.
    *   The post does not mention any suicidal thoughts that are then negated.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly describes general distress (""hard to keep going,"" ""badly mangled (psychically)""), hopelessness (""never really goes away,"" ""wonder if a long-term cure even exists""), and mental health struggles (depression). Since there is no explicit desire to die, no plan, and no past attempt, this falls into the Indicator category. The phrase ""hard to keep going"" signifies distress and a struggle to continue living, which is a strong indicator of mental health struggle and hopelessness, but not a direct statement of suicidal ideation as defined.

Based on this analysis, the post fits the criteria for Indicator.

The user post describes significant distress, including the impact of discovering their father's suicide, feelings of inevitability, and long-term struggles.
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for suicide. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post states, ""I get suicidal thoughts."" This phrase alone might suggest Ideation. However, the crucial part immediately follows: ""but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it."" This phrase explicitly negates the intent to act on these thoughts. It's a statement of having the thoughts but rejecting the possibility of acting on them due to a perceived personal barrier.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The rule for Indicator states: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them (e.g., intrusive or unwanted thoughts)."" The statement ""I get suicidal thoughts but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" perfectly fits this definition. The user is acknowledging the presence of suicidal thoughts but simultaneously expressing a lack of intent or ability to act on them, effectively negating the active desire to die.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the active desire is negated, and there's no plan or past attempt, the post falls into the Indicator category.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The user does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempts.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The user states ""i wanna off myself,"" which is suicidal ideation. However, they do not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The user explicitly states ""i wanna off myself, obviously."" This is a direct expression of a desire to die. While they express fear and ambivalence (""but i'm scared,"" ""i just wanna hang onto that string of hope""), the core desire to ""off myself"" is clearly articulated. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user does not negate the suicidal thought by saying they don't actually want to act on it (e.g., ""my brain tells me to, but I don't want to""). Instead, they express a desire to ""off myself"" alongside fear of missing out, which is ambivalence, not negation of the desire itself.
5.  **Final Classification:** Based on the explicit statement ""i wanna off myself"" without any concrete plan or past attempt, and the absence of negation of the desire, the appropriate classification is Ideation.

The user expresses clear and active suicidal desire multiple times: ""I want to give up my life and just die,"" and ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE."" This fits the definition of Ideation.

I then check if there is any mention of a plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). The post does not contain any of these elements. Therefore, it does not escalate to Behavior.

I also check for negated thoughts. While the user expresses conflict (""but i can't leave my parents too""), this is a reason *not to act* on the desire, not a negation or rejection of the desire itself. The desire to die is clearly stated and remains active. Therefore, it is not an Indicator.

There is no mention of a past attempt or self-harm, so it is not Attempt.

Based on the hierarchy and definitions, the post fits the Ideation category because it expresses a clear desire to die without a concrete plan.

For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me.

We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post states, ""I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe."" The definition for ""Attempt"" explicitly includes ""non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting."" Since the user describes a past act of self-harm (cutting), this immediately qualifies the post for the ""Attempt"" category. The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post clearly mentions past cutting and also includes current ideation (""I'm ending it"") and a conditional plan (""we will do it together""). Therefore, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

The user is expressing significant distress and hopelessness due to a breakup (""She's still gone, I know she's never coming back"").
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation for suicide. The post contains phrases like ""Why is it frowned upon to kill yourself? It's perfectly reasonable."" and ""So that means I need to die because it's better than living in pain."" While these express a desire to die and rationalize it, they do not include any specific details of *how*, *when*, or *where* the user plans to act. There is no mention of tools, a specific time, a location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life. The post states, ""Life isn't worth it without her."" and ""So that means I need to die because it's better than living in pain."" These are clear and direct expressions of a desire to die.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. The user is *not* negating these thoughts; rather, they are rationalizing them (""It's perfectly reasonable,"" ""I need to die because it's better than living in pain""). Therefore, it is not an Indicator based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is not applicable because an active suicidal desire has been identified.

**Conclusion:** The post clearly expresses an active desire to die (""Life isn't worth it,"" ""I need to die"") but lacks any concrete plan. This aligns with the definition of Ideation. It does not describe a past attempt.

The user has provided a post consisting of quotes from their parents. My task is to classify the suicide risk level of the *person writing the post*, based on the content.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: The post does not contain any explicit statement from the user about a current plan (method, timing, location, preparation) to end their life. The parents' quotes suggest the user *should* kill themselves, but this is not the user's own stated plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: The user does not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or similar phrases. The post focuses on the parents' abusive language.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they are rejecting.

4.  **Default to Indicator**: If none of the above fit, it defaults to Indicator. However, I need to carefully re-read for any elements of higher risk.

Let's re-examine the ""Attempt"" definition and the hierarchy rule:
*   **Attempt Definition**: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts... and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting. The focus is on the past action.""
*   **Hierarchy Rule**: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""

Several quotes from the parents *directly refer to past actions by the user*:
*   ""What? **Did you try to kill yourself again?** So be it, You are too coward to actually do it, anyway"" - Dad
*   ""What? Had a bad day at school? **Are you going to try to kill yourself again?** Hahahaha"" - Dad
*   ""Why are you crying? **Are you going to cut your wrists again?** Stop it with this shit. You are just doing it for attention"" - Dad

The user is presenting these quotes as part of their lived experience. The parents' questions and statements (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"") strongly imply that the user *has a history* of suicide attempts or non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). The phrase ""again"" is key here, indicating repeated past behavior.

Even though the user isn't explicitly saying ""I attempted,"" by sharing these quotes, they are implicitly describing a history of such actions. The post *describes* (through the parents' words) past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts by the user. This fits the ""Attempt"" category, as it refers to a past action of self-harm or suicide attempt.

Given the hierarchy, the presence of descriptions of past attempts/NSSI elevates the risk to ""Attempt,"" even if there's no current ideation or plan explicitly stated by the user. The post is a narrative of the user's experiences, and the parents' words within that narrative reveal the user's past actions.

415,What's the least painful way to kill yourself?. I know I shouldn't be asking this but I just need a way to Kim's. I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit someone just give me a straight up answer.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is asking for the least painful way to kill themselves, stating ""I just need a way to Kim's"" (likely ""kill myself"" or ""end this"").

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a clear suicidal desire (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?"", ""I just need a way to Kim's""). Crucially, the user is actively *seeking a method* (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""). Asking for a method is a direct component of planning, as per the definition of a plan including ""Method: Mentioning tools, substances, weapons."" Even though they don't *have* a method yet, they are actively trying to acquire information about one, which constitutes a preparatory action or seeking a component of a plan. This elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Yes, the post clearly expresses a desire to die. However, since a component of planning (seeking a method) is present, 'Behavior' is a more appropriate classification.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating their suicidal thoughts; they are actively seeking information to act on them.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk categories fit.

Based on the hierarchy, actively seeking a method constitutes a component of planning, placing this in the 'Behavior' category.

Final Classification: behavior",behavior,True
416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post says ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note *again*."" While ""again"" implies a past action of writing a note, it does not describe a past *act* of self-harm or a suicide *attempt*. It's about a future preparatory action, not a past physical attempt. So, not Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note"" clearly indicates suicidal intent.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? Yes, ""writing a suicidal note"" is explicitly defined as a ""Preparation"" action within the ""plan"" criteria.
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and a preparatory action (part of a plan) are present, this fits the definition of Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Not applicable, as Behavior was identified as a higher risk.)

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts/Indicator:** (Not applicable, as Behavior was identified as a higher risk.)

**Final Classification based on Hierarchy:** The post contains a clear expression of suicidal intent and a preparatory action, which categorizes it as Behavior.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post is: ""I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It refers to future actions. So, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""slaying myself"" clearly indicates suicidal ideation.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
        *   Method: ""slaying myself"" implies a method of killing oneself, but it doesn't specify a *tool*, *substance*, or *weapon* as per the definition of a ""plan"" (e.g., ""pills,"" ""rope""). It's more a general term for the act of killing oneself, similar to ""killing myself.""
        *   Timing: No specific timing is mentioned.
        *   Location: No specific location is mentioned.
        *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are mentioned.
    *   While ""slaying myself"" is a strong statement of intent, it lacks the concrete details of a *plan* (specific method/tool, timing, location, or preparation) required to classify it as 'Behavior'. The examples for 'Behavior' (""gone tonight,"" ""kill myself at 21"") involve specific timeframes. ""Slaying myself"" is a direct expression of the desire/intent to die, but without the *how*, *when*, or *where* that constitutes a *plan* in this framework.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life? Yes, ""slaying myself"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to end one's life. It is not passive.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want? No, the user states ""or maybe just slaying myself,"" which is presented as a potential future action, not an unwanted intrusive thought.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear, active suicidal desire (""slaying myself"") but does not include any concrete plan elements (specific method/tool, timing, location, or preparation) as defined for the 'Behavior' category. Therefore, it falls under 'Ideation'.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut).

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and then apply the category definitions.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will scan the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to ending one's life.
    *   The post is long and detailed, focusing on feelings of laziness, unfulfilled potential, social isolation, and self-doubt. There is no mention of any plan to end their life (no method, timing, location, or preparation).

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The post contains the sentence: ""As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody.""
    *   This sentence is crucial. While the user *mentions* ""suicidal ideation,"" they immediately and explicitly state, ""I don't want to die— I want to live."" This directly negates any active desire to die.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The statement ""I don't want to die— I want to live"" directly indicates that any suicidal thoughts (referred to as ""suicidal ideation"") are not aligned with their true desire. They are rejecting the idea of dying and affirming their desire to live. This perfectly fits the definition of negated thoughts within the Indicator category.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post primarily describes general distress, feelings of being stuck, laziness, social anxieties, and academic struggles. The explicit negation of wanting to die confirms that it's not Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly negates a desire to die and instead expresses a desire to live, even while acknowledging past ""suicidal ideation"" as stemming from shame. This aligns perfectly with the ""negated thoughts"" rule for the Indicator category.

But at the same time I'm hesitant because what if I don't die, but instead get permanently disabled and have to sit in a wheelchair for the rest of my life?. I don't want to have to be crippled like that, so I'm not risking it. And before anybody says anything, no, I'm not calling a suicide hotline. I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post based on the given hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes a desire and hesitation about a future action (""I wanna get my dad's handgun...""), not a past act of self-harm or a completed/aborted attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan? Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head.""
    *   However, the post continues: ""But at the same time I'm hesitant because what if I don't die, but instead get permanently disabled... I don't want to have to be crippled like that, so I'm not risking it."" The phrase ""so I'm not risking it"" is a clear statement that the user is *not going to act* on this plan due to a specific fear of a negative outcome (disability).

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post *does* express a desire to die (""I wanna... shoot myself""). If the plan were not present or if the negation wasn't so strong, it might lean towards Ideation. However, the presence of a method (even if negated) needs careful consideration against the 'Behavior' and 'Indicator' definitions.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   The ""Crucial Rule"" for Indicator states: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.""
    *   The user explicitly states a suicidal thought with a method (""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"").
    *   Crucially, they then state: ""so I'm not risking it."" This is a clear rejection of acting on the plan, even if the initial desire was present. The reason for the rejection (fear of permanent disability) is a valid form of negation.
    *   This fits the definition of Indicator, as the user is expressing suicidal thoughts but clearly states they will not act on them. The presence of a method is noted, but the explicit negation of action (""so I'm not risking it"") overrides classifying it as Behavior, as the user is not currently *planning* to execute it.

**Conclusion:** While the post mentions a method, the explicit statement ""so I'm not risking it"" indicates a clear decision *not to act* on the suicidal thoughts/plan. This aligns directly with the definition of 'Indicator' where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but rejects acting on them.

My life wasnt good before getting sick, but now, it has become unbearable.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for elements of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation) alongside suicidal thoughts.
    *   The post states: ""my life isnt worth living anymore."" and ""If my breathing doesnt go back to normal I cant see myself having a life worthliving.""
    *   There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., a bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note).
    *   The statement ""If my breathing doesnt go back to normal I cant see myself having a life worthliving"" is a conditional statement about the *quality* of life, not a plan to end it. It expresses a future state of despair if circumstances don't change, but not a concrete plan to act.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will check if the post expresses a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   The phrases ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" and ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving"" clearly express a strong sense of hopelessness and a desire for their current life state to end, or that life itself is not worth continuing. This goes beyond general sadness and indicates a personal, active desire to not be alive under these conditions.
    *   The post does not negate these thoughts; they are presented as the user's current feelings and conclusions.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). The statements are presented as the user's own genuine feelings about their life's worth.

**Conclusion:** The post explicitly expresses a desire that life is not worth living (""my life isnt worth living anymore,"" ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving""), which falls under the definition of expressing a desire to no longer be alive or to die. However, it lacks any concrete plan. This aligns perfectly with the 'Ideation' category.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   Not Attempt (no past action).
*   Not Behavior (no plan).
*   Is Ideation (explicit desire not to be alive).
*   Stronger than Indicator (not just general distress or negated thoughts).

Therefore, the highest risk category present is Ideation.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It discusses future intentions.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon,"" and ""by February I think I'll be gone.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   Method: No specific method is mentioned.
        *   Timing: Yes, ""by February I think I'll be gone"" specifies a future timeframe. The user also mentions ""I don't want to do it on Christmas,"" indicating a consideration of timing.
        *   Location: No specific location is mentioned.
        *   Preparation: No preparatory actions are described.
    Since there is clear suicidal ideation (""I think I'm going to kill myself soon,"" ""by February I think I'll be gone"") and a specific timeframe (""by February""), this meets the criteria for **Behavior**. The presence of a plan element (timing) elevates it beyond Ideation.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** (This step is technically covered by the Behavior check, as Behavior requires ideation plus a plan). The post clearly expresses a desire to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting the suicidal thoughts; they are expressing them as a future intention.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as higher risk categories have been identified.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of suicidal ideation combined with a specific timeframe (""by February"") classifies this post as Behavior.

The user post is: ""I just want to die its that plain and simple. Too many problems, im a fucked up person, gonna end my life this month.""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It talks about future intent.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I just want to die"" and ""gonna end my life"" clearly express a desire to die.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan? Yes, ""this month"" specifies a timeframe for the act.
    *   Since there is both active suicidal desire and a component of planning (timing), this fits the definition of Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is superseded because a plan element was identified, elevating it to Behavior.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating their suicidal thoughts; they are affirming them and stating a timeframe.

Based on the hierarchy, Behavior is the highest risk category present.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   No, the post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but does not describe any past actions or attempts.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" (""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughs helped me to understood the world"").
    *   However, it does not mention any specific plan components (method, timing, location, or preparation).

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** If not an attempt or behavior, does the post explicitly express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The post states, ""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughs helped me to understood the world.""
    *   While the phrase ""suicidal thoughts"" implies a desire to die, the post uses it to describe a characteristic or a lens through which they view the world, rather than an explicit, active statement of wanting to die *now*. It's a statement about having these thoughts, not a direct expression of a current desire (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I'm going to die soon""). The definition for Ideation emphasizes ""explicitly expresses a desire."" This post describes the *presence* of thoughts, not an *active desire*.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Before finalizing on Ideation, check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want.
    *   The user does not negate or reject the suicidal thoughts; in fact, they state these thoughts ""helped me to understood the world."" So, this specific rule for Indicator (negated thoughts) does not apply.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress and hopelessness about the world (""shitty modern world,"" ""world is falling apart,"" ""suffering,"" ""mental ill people"").
    *   It mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" as something they possess, which has given them a certain perspective. This falls under ""discusses suicide thematically"" but ""lacks a personal, active desire to die."" The post is discussing the *experience* of having suicidal thoughts and their impact on worldview, rather than actively stating a desire to die. It's a thematic discussion of suicidal thoughts as part of their identity and understanding, not a direct expression of current suicidal intent or desire.

Based on the strict definition of ""Ideation"" requiring an *explicit* desire to die, and ""Indicator"" covering thematic discussions of suicide without that explicit desire, this post fits best into Indicator.

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution,"" and ""If I kill myself"".
    *   Does it mention any form of plan? Yes, it specifies a timing: ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday"". It also explicitly states ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out,"" which indicates active consideration of planning.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and a specific timing (a component of planning), the post falls into the Behavior category.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** This is present, but the planning component elevates it beyond Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user does not negate or reject the suicidal thoughts; rather, they present them as the ""only solution"" and discuss planning.
5.  **Default to Indicator?** No, because higher risk categories are present.

Based on the presence of suicidal ideation combined with a specific timing (""on my birthday"") and the explicit mention of ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out,"" the classification is Behavior.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states ""I've been thinking of ending it all"" and ""So what is the point anymore,"" which expresses suicidal thoughts. However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""I've been thinking of ending it all"" is a direct and active expression of a desire to end one's life. ""So what is the point anymore"" further reinforces this sense of hopelessness and desire for cessation. This fits the definition of Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is expressing their own thoughts and feelings, not intrusive thoughts they are rejecting. There is no phrase like ""but I don't actually want to.""
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since active suicidal desire is present, it does not default to Indicator.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of active suicidal desire without a plan places it in the Ideation category.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It discusses future actions (""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"").
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** The user clearly expresses a desire to end their life (""I want to do this once and for all. I want to get it over with."").
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Timing:** ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend."" This is a specific timeframe.
        *   **Preparation:** ""It's probably best if I get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents."" This is a preparatory action for death.
    *   Since both suicidal thoughts and elements of a plan (timing and preparation) are present, the post falls under the 'Behavior' category.
3.  **Hierarchy Rule:** No past attempt is mentioned, but current ideation with a plan is present. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the highest applicable risk level.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I need to follow the hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post mentions ""the blades i used to cut won't go that deep."" This indicates past non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, it does not describe a past suicide *attempt* (e.g., ""I put a belt around my neck but then stopped""). The hierarchy rule for Attempt states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" While there is conditional ideation (""I really cannot live if I fail""), the primary focus is on the *current* state of *not* wanting to die and a lack of means. The past NSSI reference alone, without a clear past suicide attempt or strong current intent, does not elevate it to Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan)**: The post explicitly states a *lack* of a plan and means: ""The right time is gone, i have no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep."" Therefore, there is no plan present.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)**: The post contains the conditional statement: ""But i really cannot live if i fail."" This expresses a desire to not be alive if a specific condition is met. This is a form of suicidal ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)**: Before settling on Ideation, I need to check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. The post contains several strong negations and positive statements:
    *   ""But for the first time i don't wanna die"" - This is a direct rejection of current suicidal desire.
    *   ""it's not like i wanna live either but i have stuff to do and I'm in the middle of making plans to move and i don't want to waste money to then die right after."" - Expresses reasons *not* to die currently.
    *   ""It's like for the first time in my life I'm almost happy, I'm almost enjoying doing stuff for my new room... it's like i have a purpose or something."" - Expresses positive feelings and finding purpose.
    *   ""I'm in a decent place right now and i want to keep doing things."" - Reiterates current positive state and desire to live.
    *   ""I'm feeling better nonetheless and i don't even know how I'll do it"" - Implies a lack of current intent or means, and a general improvement in mood.

    While there is a conditional ideation (""cannot live if I fail""), the overwhelming sentiment of the post is a strong rejection of current suicidal desire, a focus on reasons to live, and a description of feeling better. The user is acknowledging suicidal thoughts/conditions but actively fighting against them and stating they do not want to act on them *currently*. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Indicator: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.""

**Final Decision**: Despite the conditional ideation, the explicit rejection of current suicidal desire and the strong emphasis on finding reasons to live and feeling better place this post in the Indicator category. The user is demonstrating resilience and a desire to not act on suicidal thoughts.

School and work have drained me the fuck out of all my motivation in the things I love. And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time.

This neverending process only helps the things I hate the most, and I don't know what to do anymore with my life.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and definitions.

1.  **Check for an Attempt**: The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?)**: I need to look for suicidal thoughts combined with a method, timing, location, or preparation.
    *   The post expresses extreme distress, exhaustion, and a feeling of being lost (""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"").
    *   However, it does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, weapon), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., ""a bridge""), or preparatory actions (e.g., ""writing a note"").
    *   Since there is no plan component, it is not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?)**: I need to determine if the post expresses a clear desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   Phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to end it all,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I'm going to die soon,"" or ""I wish I were dead"" are indicators of Ideation.
    *   The post contains ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life."" While this indicates profound hopelessness and a feeling of being lost, it does not explicitly state a *desire to die* or a wish for life to end. It expresses a lack of direction and purpose, rather than a direct intent or wish for death. It's a statement of being utterly lost and overwhelmed by life's difficulties, not a direct expression of wanting to die.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?)**: The post does not mention suicidal thoughts that the user then rejects (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to"").

5.  **Default to Indicator**: Since the post does not meet the criteria for Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation, it defaults to 'Indicator'. The post clearly expresses general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles (""School and work have drained me the fuck out of all my motivation,"" ""taken my will to strive,"" ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator'.

Either kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out, shoot myself with a gun, or start cutting myself to try and ease my pain.

Im sorry everyone. Im not strong enough.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a *past* act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    The post describes *future* potential actions (""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do. Either kill myself...""). It does not describe a completed or aborted past attempt. So, it is not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** Yes, explicitly (""kill myself,"" ""Its a net gain for the world if i die,"" ""I'm just waiting for the end,"" ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold"").
    *   **Plan - Method:** Yes, multiple methods are mentioned: ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out,"" ""shoot myself with a gun,"" ""start cutting myself"" (in the context of ending pain, which could be lethal or NSSI, but given the other explicit methods, it contributes to the overall planning).
    *   **Plan - Timing/Location/Preparation:**
        *   Conditional timing/location: ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do."" This implies a future action, possibly soon, and a specific setting.
        *   Readiness: ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold.""
        *   Contemplation of aftermath: ""My body probably wouldn't be found for months until my bills start rising."" This indicates a detailed consideration of the act.

    Since there is clear suicidal ideation and explicit mention of methods and conditional timing/location, this post fits the definition of **Behavior**.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post express a desire to no longer be alive or to die, but without a concrete plan?
    While there is strong ideation, the presence of a plan elevates it beyond just Ideation.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** Does the post show general distress or reject suicidal thoughts?
    No, the user is actively expressing a desire to die and detailing how.

**Conclusion based on hierarchy:** The post contains elements of Behavior (suicidal ideation + specific methods/planning). This is the highest risk category present.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, it does not.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   First, I need to identify if there are suicidal thoughts. I'm looking for phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to end it all,"" ""I hate living,"" ""I'm going to die soon,"" ""I wish I were dead.""
    *   Reviewing the post: ""This world is shit,"" ""the people around me are out to get me,"" ""I don't know what I'm doing wrong,"" ""I don't know what to do,"" ""God am I just paranoid as fuck?"", ""how do I know which 'delusions' are real,"" ""I just want someone to goddamn love me why am I so unlovable,"" ""I want to cry my damn eyes out right now,"" ""I seriously don't know what's real.""
    *   None of these phrases explicitly state a desire to die or to end one's life. They convey extreme distress, paranoia, confusion, and a feeling of being unloved and lost, but not a direct wish for death.
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal ideation, there cannot be a plan.
    *   Therefore, this is not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die?
    *   As identified in the previous step, the post expresses profound emotional pain, hopelessness, paranoia, and a sense of being unloved and confused about reality. However, it does *not* contain any direct statements indicating a personal desire to die or to end one's life. Phrases like ""I want to cry my damn eyes out right now"" express intense sadness, but not a wish for death. ""I seriously don't know what's real"" indicates mental distress and confusion, not suicidal intent.
    *   Therefore, this is not Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Before defaulting to Indicator, I check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. The post does not mention any suicidal thoughts at all, so this specific sub-condition for Indicator isn't met, but it doesn't preclude the broader Indicator definition.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   This post perfectly fits this definition. It is a raw outpouring of distress, paranoia, feelings of abandonment, self-doubt, and a desperate plea for understanding and love. These are all clear signs of mental health struggles and hopelessness, but they do not cross the threshold into active suicidal ideation or planning.

Based on this analysis, the highest risk category present is Indicator.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post. I need to follow the specified hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation.""
    *   It provides specific details of planning:
        *   ""calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning."" (Method, Preparation)
        *   ""tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass."" (Method, Preparation)
        *   ""determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house... so that I can potentially jump in front of their speeding car"" (Method, Timing, Location - though later ruled out).
        *   ""I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me."" (Preparation, Timing/Location consideration).
    *   The user directly states, ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""
    *   The presence of these detailed plans, even if the user states a reason for not acting on them (""But I don't do it. I don't deserve to.""), clearly indicates a component of planning.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   The post contains multiple explicit statements of suicidal desire:
        *   ""I wanna kill myself.""
        *   ""I want to die because I hate myself.""
        *   ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide.""
    *   This clearly indicates active suicidal desire.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   While the user states, ""But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me,"" this is a *reason for not acting* rather than a negation of the suicidal thoughts or plans themselves. The user actively engages in ""ideating"" as a ""hobby"" and states ""I have the plans."" The thoughts and plans are present and acknowledged, not rejected as intrusive or unwanted.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as higher risk categories are clearly met.

**Hierarchy Application:**
The post contains both active suicidal ideation (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""I want to die"") and detailed components of planning (specific methods, preparation, timing/location considerations). According to the hierarchy, the presence of both ideation and planning classifies the post as ""Behavior."" The fact that the user has a reason for not acting (not deserving death/mercy) is a protective factor, but it does not negate the existence of the plans and the active contemplation of suicide.
The post does not describe a past attempt or self-harm, so it is not ""Attempt.""
It clearly includes planning, so it is more severe than ""Ideation.""
It is not general distress or negated thoughts, so it is not ""Indicator.""

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is Behavior.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It refers to a future ""day I chose"" and a decade-long desire, but no past action.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** Yes, the post clearly expresses a desire to die: ""the day i chose is very soon,"" ""i know a bunch of people are going to tell me that if i have people that love me i shouldn't kill myself,"" ""i'm not interested in being talked down at all,"" ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade,"" ""i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living.""
    *   **Plan Elements:**
        *   **Timing:** ""the day i chose is very soon."" This indicates a specific, imminent timeframe, even if the exact date isn't disclosed.
        *   **Preparation:** The user is contemplating actions like calling grandparents, telling friends they love them, and hugging their brother. The context (""i don't want them to think the phone call was me trying to be talked down or something,"" ""not sure if that would like, haunt people more or something"") strongly suggests these are considered as preparatory ""goodbye"" actions before the ""chosen day.""
    *   Since there is clear ideation and elements of a plan (timing and preparatory actions), this qualifies as Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is not needed as Behavior has been identified, which is a higher risk category.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is not needed as Behavior has been identified.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation and elements of a plan (timing and preparatory actions). Therefore, it falls under the 'Behavior' category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post. I will follow the provided thinking process and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months and I Just want to be out of my misery."" This clearly indicates suicidal thoughts and a desire to end suffering.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
        *   Method: No specific method is mentioned.
        *   Timing: No specific timing is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21"").
        *   Location: No specific location is mentioned.
        *   Preparation: The phrase ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" could be interpreted as a form of withdrawal or isolation, which can precede suicidal acts. However, the examples for ""preparation"" in the guidelines are ""writing a note, saying goodbye."" These are direct actions related to the *act* of suicide. ""Not going to contact anyone"" is more about disengagement from social support rather than a direct preparation for the act itself. Given the strictness of the examples provided for 'Behavior' (like ""I want to be gone tonight"" or ""I plan to kill myself at 21""), this phrase doesn't clearly meet the threshold of a concrete *plan* element for the suicidal act itself.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Since it's not 'Attempt' or clearly 'Behavior', I check for 'Ideation'.
    *   Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die? Yes. ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" in the context of ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" is a clear and active expression of a desire to end their life/suffering. This goes beyond general distress.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not agree with. The desire to be ""out of misery"" is presented as their own feeling. Therefore, it's not 'Indicator'.

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation (""I Just want to be out of my misery,"" ""most suicidal I've been"") but lacks a concrete, specific plan element as defined by the examples for 'Behavior'. The statement about not contacting anyone is a concerning sign of withdrawal but doesn't elevate it to a 'Behavior' level based on the provided criteria for 'plan'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I just want to die"", ""I just want to kill myself""). However, it explicitly states ""but I can't find a suitable way to go"", indicating a *lack* of a concrete plan (method, timing, location, preparation). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die (""I just want to die"", ""I just want to kill myself""). It does not include any concrete plan. This perfectly fits the definition of 'ideation'.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is not negating their suicidal thoughts; they are actively expressing a desire to die and frustration at not finding a way.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as 'ideation' fits.

Based on the hierarchy, 'ideation' is the highest risk category that applies.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to suicide. The post discusses feeling at a ""low point,"" having ""zero social skills/low self esteem/lonely,"" and asks for advice on moving to another country for ""better living."" There is no mention of any suicidal plan or component of planning.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit expressions of a desire to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I'm going to end it all""). The post expresses distress and loneliness, but it does not contain any phrases indicating a desire to die. Instead, it asks for advice on how to improve life by moving to another country, which suggests a desire to live, albeit a better life.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Since there are no explicit suicidal thoughts, there are no thoughts to negate.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post does not fit into Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation, it expresses general distress, loneliness, and a desire for advice on improving life. This aligns with the definition of Indicator.

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post for the person who wrote it.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt by the *poster*? No, the post expresses a death wish towards another person, not a past action by the poster.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts by the *poster* and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? No, the post does not express suicidal thoughts by the poster. It expresses a wish for someone else to die.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire for the *poster* to no longer be alive or to die? No, the post expresses a desire for *another person* to die, not the poster themselves.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Does the user mention suicidal thoughts *they* do not agree with or want? No, the post does not mention any suicidal thoughts by the poster.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, does the post express general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die *for the poster*? The post expresses extreme anger and frustration (""To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP""). While not suicidal distress, this is a form of ""general distress"" stemming from a negative emotional state (anger, frustration over account ban). Since there is no indication of the poster's own suicidal intent, and it shows general distress, it falls into the broadest category of ""Indicator"" by default. The instruction ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"" means I must only consider the poster's risk, and since there's no direct suicidal content from the poster, but there is clear distress, Indicator is the appropriate default.

Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post based on the given hierarchy and definitions. I must only consider the suicide risk of the person writing the post.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No. The post describes intent to harm another person.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post include suicidal ideation and a component of planning? No. The post clearly expresses a plan to murder another person (""I will kill her,"" ""Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?""), but it does not contain any suicidal ideation (desire to die or end one's own life).
3.  **Check for Ideation:** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die (the user's own death)? No. The user expresses a desire to kill their bully to ""finally live my life in peace,"" which is the opposite of wanting to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Does the user mention suicidal thoughts but clearly reject them? No, there are no suicidal thoughts mentioned at all.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** The instructions state: ""If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die. This is an Indicator.""
    *   The post expresses significant distress (""I have a problem,"" ""I tried every possible thing"").
    *   It expresses a sense of hopelessness in resolving the bullying situation through non-violent means.
    *   It clearly demonstrates mental health struggles (extreme response to bullying, homicidal ideation).
    *   Crucially, it is ""without a stated desire to die"" (referring to the user's own death).

While the post contains extremely serious threats of violence towards others, my task is to classify *suicide risk*. Since there is no indication of suicidal intent, ideation, or behavior, and the post expresses general distress and mental health struggles, the lowest suicide risk category, ""Indicator,"" is the only fitting option within the provided framework.

438,I'm on the verge of suicide. 19F I seriously cannot do this anymore. My mental health really bad and the stress of college is making. Honestly the stress might kill me before I even kill myself. I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It expresses current distress and future intent/knowledge. So, not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post explicitly states, ""I'm on the verge of suicide,"" and ""I just want to end it all,"" indicating suicidal ideation. Crucially, it also states, ""and I know exactly what to do."" This phrase implies the presence of a concrete plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) that the user has formulated, even if the details are not shared. This moves it beyond mere ideation into the 'behavior' category due to the implied plan.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The phrases ""I'm on the verge of suicide"" and ""I just want to end it all"" clearly express an active desire to die. If there were no implied plan, this would be 'ideation'.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is not rejecting or negating their suicidal thoughts; rather, they are expressing a clear desire and knowledge of how to act on them. So, not 'indicator'.

Since the post contains active suicidal ideation and an implied plan (""I know exactly what to do""), the highest risk category present is Behavior.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post says ""Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die."" It does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. So, it is not Behavior.
2. **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrases ""Someone kill me dude"" and ""I just wanna die"" clearly express an active desire to not be alive or to die. This fits the definition of Ideation.
3. **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is directly expressing a desire to die; they are not stating that these are unwanted or rejected thoughts (e.g., ""my brain tells me to, but I don't want to""). Therefore, it is not an Indicator based on negation.

Based on this, the post expresses a clear desire to die without any planning component, which classifies it as Ideation.

The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes past trauma (""molested at 5 years"") and current intense emotional pain, but it does not describe any past self-harm or a suicide attempt (aborted or completed). So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses extreme distress, unhappiness, and a desire for their current struggles to end or be taken away. However, it does not express any suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I want to end it all"") nor does it mention any form of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation). The user is pleading for a miracle to change their circumstances, not to end their life. So, it's not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post explicitly express a desire to no longer be alive or to die? No. The user states they are ""tired of being unhappy lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed and always rejected,"" and asks ""please take all thoughts away from my mind."" These phrases convey profound suffering and a wish for their current painful state to cease, but they do not explicitly state a desire to die or to end their life. The desire is to be ""normal"" and for their suffering to be removed, not for their existence to end. So, it's not 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles (gender dysphoria, depression, feeling rejected, unhappiness). The user is pleading for help and a miracle to alleviate their suffering and change their circumstances. There are no explicit suicidal thoughts mentioned that are then negated; rather, the user is expressing a desire for their *negative thoughts* and *negative circumstances* to be taken away. This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator'.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since no elements of Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation are present, and the post clearly shows general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles without a stated desire to die, it falls into the 'Indicator' category.

441,"Anyone suicidal from knee pain?. Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior):** The post does not express any suicidal thoughts combined with a plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). The phrase ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" is a question, not a statement of personal intent or a plan.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post asks ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"". This is a question directed at others, not a direct statement of the user's personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I'm going to die soon""). While it highlights extreme distress and hopelessness related to chronic pain, it does not explicitly state the *user's* active desire to end their life. It's more of a rhetorical question to express the severity of their pain and its impact.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The post does not express suicidal thoughts that are then explicitly rejected by the user.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness due to chronic pain. It uses the term ""suicidal"" in a questioning context to convey the severity of the pain's impact, but it does not articulate a personal, active desire to die. It fits the definition of ""general distress, hopelessness, or discusses suicide thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die.""

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt by the user. It mentions someone else's suicide, but not the user's. So, it's not ""Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan + Ideation):**
    *   **Ideation:** The post contains clear expressions of suicidal ideation: ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""I'm over life,"" ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death.""
    *   **Plan Component:** The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" is crucial. This indicates a specific condition or task (""One last record for me to make"") that must be completed *before* the intended end (""and its finally over""). This constitutes a form of preparatory action or a specific timing linked to an event, which falls under the definition of a ""plan"" (specifically, preparation or timing).

3.  **Check for Ideation:** While ideation is present, the presence of a plan component (""One last record for me to make and its finally over"") elevates the risk to ""Behavior.""

4.  **Check for Indicator:** This category is for general distress or negated suicidal thoughts. The post contains active suicidal desire and a plan component, so it's not ""Indicator.""

Based on the presence of clear suicidal ideation and a specific, albeit personal, preparatory action/timing (""One last record for me to make and its finally over""), the post fits the criteria for ""Behavior.""

1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?** The post expresses a desire to die (""I want to die""), but it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is, it'll be worth it"" refers to the *impact* on the mother, not a plan for the suicide itself. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The post explicitly states, ""I want to die."" This is a clear and active expression of a desire to no longer be alive.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is expressing a clear desire to die and does not negate or reject this thought. It is not presented as an intrusive or unwanted thought.

Based on the hierarchy, since there is clear active suicidal desire but no plan or past attempt, the classification is Ideation.

The user post expresses profound distress, feelings of worthlessness, and a clear desire to die (""I just want my death to come faster"").

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post explicitly mentions multiple methods: ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" and ""access to a gun."" It also specifies timing: ""if I keep starving myself I'll at least be dead by the end of the week."" Furthermore, it describes a preparatory action: ""I've started to try and starve myself."" The presence of methods, timing, and preparatory actions clearly indicates a plan.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains phrases like ""I just want my death to come faster"" and ""I'd have a better place in heaven, at least I'll be able to see my dad again,"" which are direct expressions of a desire to die.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating or rejecting these thoughts; they are expressing a clear intent and actively pursuing a method.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk elements are present.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:**
The post contains both active suicidal ideation and concrete elements of a plan (methods, timing, and preparatory actions). According to the hierarchy, the presence of a plan elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior. The action ""I've started to try and starve myself"" is an ongoing action towards the plan, not a completed past attempt as defined for the 'Attempt' category (which focuses on a past act of self-harm or aborted attempt). Therefore, 'Behavior' is the highest applicable risk level.

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan?):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan?
    *   The post explicitly states: ""I plan my suicide every single day."" This is a direct admission of planning.
    *   It also mentions specific methods: ""using a pistol or an escape bag,"" and ""douse myself in gasoline and light up.""
    *   The presence of clear suicidal ideation (""I just don't want to go on anymore,"" ""I'm so tired of going through the motions"") combined with explicit planning (daily planning, specific methods) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive: ""I just don't want to go on anymore.""
    *   This is present, but the presence of a plan elevates it beyond just 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   The user does not negate their suicidal thoughts. In fact, they state that the planning provides ""solace"" and is ""the only thing keeping me going."" This indicates an active engagement with the suicidal thoughts and plans, not a rejection of them.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as higher risk categories are clearly present.

**Conclusion:** The post contains clear suicidal ideation (""I just don't want to go on anymore"") and explicit planning with specific methods (""I plan my suicide every single day,"" ""using a pistol or an escape bag,"" ""douse myself in gasoline and light up""). According to the hierarchy, the presence of both ideation and a plan classifies it as 'Behavior'.

The user's post contains several elements that need to be evaluated against the risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post explicitly describes multiple past suicide attempts: ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists,"" ""When I was 19 I laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over,"" and ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train."" Crucially, it also describes a *very recent* aborted attempt: ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck. well but I'm a chicken."" This directly matches the definition of an 'Attempt' (describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt, including aborted attempts). The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" The post clearly describes past attempts and current ideation/distress.

Given the presence of multiple past attempts and a recent aborted attempt, the highest risk category is 'Attempt'. I do not need to proceed to check for Behavior, Ideation, or Indicator, as 'Attempt' takes precedence.

I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be. Especially when I see that the future is really grim.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post. I will follow the provided hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It talks about not going to the doctor, which is a passive action, not an active attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post states, ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it"". This directly negates the presence of an active plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) to *end* life. While stopping medical care is concerning, it's described as a willingness to *accept* death rather than an active step to *cause* it. The criteria for Behavior requires a plan to *cause* one's death.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post contains several phrases indicating a desire to not be alive or a strong indifference to dying:
    *   ""I feel like I'm at the point in my life where if I die then I die."" - This expresses a clear acceptance or indifference towards death.
    *   ""I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come."" - This shows a willingness to let life end.
    *   ""I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be."" - This indicates a lack of desire to continue living or fight for life.
    These phrases collectively express a clear desire to no longer be alive or to die, even if passively.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they are fighting against or do not want. They are expressing their own acceptance and indifference towards dying.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not general distress. The explicit statements about being willing to accept death and not wanting to push life further elevate it beyond a mere indicator.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or a strong indifference to dying, without a concrete plan to *cause* death. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It focuses on current feelings and perceived inabilities.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states, ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself."" This explicitly indicates an *absence* of a plan and an *inability* to act on suicidal thoughts, rather than the presence of a plan. There is no mention of method, timing, location, or preparation.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post expresses intense self-hatred, depression, and hopelessness (""I just fucking hate myself,"" ""too depressed,"" ""too ugly,"" ""too lazy""). However, it does *not* explicitly state a desire to die, to not be alive, or to end one's life. Instead, it states ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself,"" which is a negation of the suicidal act. It highlights an internal struggle and perceived inability to act, rather than an active desire.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The phrase ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" is key. While it acknowledges the concept of suicide, the user is explicitly stating they *cannot* or *will not* act on it due to perceived cowardice. This aligns with the Indicator definition: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" The post expresses general distress and mental health struggles, but the explicit negation of the act prevents it from being classified as Ideation or higher.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since no higher categories (Attempt, Behavior, Ideation) fit, and the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and explicitly negates the act of suicide, it falls into the Indicator category.

Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt by the user. It talks about helping a ""friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide,"" not the user's own past actions.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not express any suicidal thoughts or plans by the user. It's advice on how to support others.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post does not express any desire for the user to die or not be alive. The user is discussing how to help a *friend* who is thinking about suicide, not expressing their own ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is not discussing their own intrusive thoughts or thoughts they are rejecting. They are providing advice on how to help someone else.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** The post discusses suicide thematically (in the context of helping a friend) but entirely lacks any personal, active desire to die, a plan, or a past attempt by the person writing the post. It is a general discussion about mental health support.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is expressing significant distress, hopelessness, and a lack of support.
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post mentions stopping medication and heavy drinking, and having taken the last Ativan. While these are self-destructive coping mechanisms and indicate a worsening mental state, they are not explicitly described as *part of a plan* to end their life (e.g., ""I'm going to overdose on Ativan tonight""). The Ativan is described as ""the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end,"" implying its *absence* is a problem, not its use as a method. There is no mention of a specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action for suicide.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):**
    *   ""Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live."" - Expresses a lack of desire to live.
    *   ""I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me."" - Suggests an expectation of life ending.
    *   ""I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that."" - This is a very strong statement of accepting suicide as a personal path and finding ""contentment"" with it. This clearly indicates active suicidal desire.
    *   ""I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself."" - Explicitly states ""killing myself.""
    *   ""I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die."" - Another direct expression of a desire/belief that it's time to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is *not* rejecting or negating these suicidal thoughts. In fact, they state ""I feel like I am finally becoming content with that"" and ""will only drive me further to killing myself,"" indicating acceptance or even a sense of inevitability. Therefore, it is not an Indicator due to negated thoughts.

Based on the strong and repeated expressions of a desire to die, a belief that it's ""time to die,"" and finding ""contentment"" with suicide, without any concrete plan elements, the appropriate classification is Ideation.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post discusses a potential future action (""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that"") and asks about a method (""Is drowning yourself painful?""), not a past act of self-harm or a completed/aborted suicide attempt. So, it is not an Attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   **Suicidal Thoughts:** The user clearly expresses a desire to die and considers a specific method for themselves (""I think its the best option for me,"" ""basically a guaranteed death,"" ""A nice smooth transition to death"").
    *   **Plan Component:**
        *   **Method:** ""drowning yourself"" is explicitly mentioned and discussed. ""sinking to the bottom of the ocean"" further specifies the method.
        *   **Timing/Trigger:** ""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that"" provides a conditional trigger for the action.
        *   **Location:** ""bottom of the ocean"" implies a specific location.
    *   Since suicidal thoughts are present along with a method, location, and a conditional timing/trigger, this fits the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** While Ideation is present (clear desire to die), the presence of planning elements (method, location, conditional timing) elevates it to Behavior.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not rejecting these thoughts; rather, they are actively contemplating and even romanticizing the method. Therefore, it is not an Indicator.

**Hierarchy Rule Application:** The post contains elements of Ideation and Behavior. According to the hierarchy, Behavior is a higher risk category than Ideation.

452,"Is life actually worth living anymore?. We've been in this pandemic for a year now and very little, if anything, seems to have improved. I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate? How can people justify living like this? We've been patient, we have persevered we have sacrificed so much and it has all been for nothing. Surely, I can just call it quits now?. Death seems a better option to me than living in this world. I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'. I can hardly function anymore.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process and hierarchy.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will scan the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to suicide.
    *   The post states ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"", ""I want out"", ""Surely, I can just call it quits now?"", and ""Death seems a better option to me"". These indicate suicidal thoughts/desire.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""rope""), timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at 21""), location (e.g., ""bridge""), or preparation (e.g., ""writing a note"").
    *   Therefore, the post does not meet the criteria for ""Behavior.""

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** Since it's not ""Attempt"" or ""Behavior,"" I will check if the post expresses a clear desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life.
    *   ""Is life actually worth living anymore?"" - Expresses questioning of life's worth.
    *   ""I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life..."" - Expresses inability to cope and questioning desire to continue.
    *   ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"" - Directly poses suicide as an appropriate option.
    *   ""I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out."" - Clear desire to end current existence. ""Want out"" implies ending life.
    *   ""I don't see what there is to live for."" - Expresses a lack of purpose for living.
    *   ""Surely, I can just call it quits now?"" - Implies ending life.
    *   ""Death seems a better option to me than living in this world."" - Explicitly states preference for death.
    *   ""I think it's time for me to accept defeat."" - Suggests giving up on life.
    *   These phrases collectively demonstrate a strong, active, and personal desire to die or not continue living.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Before concluding Ideation, I will check if the user is expressing suicidal thoughts that they are rejecting or do not agree with (intrusive thoughts).
    *   The post does not contain any phrases like ""but I don't actually want to"" or ""my brain tells me to, but I don't agree."" The thoughts expressed are the user's own stated desires and conclusions.
    *   Therefore, it does not fit the ""Indicator"" criteria based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is only if none of the above fit. Since active suicidal desire is clearly present, this default is not applicable.

**Final Classification based on Hierarchy:**
*   **Attempt:** Not present. No past self-harm or suicide attempt described.
*   **Behavior:** Not present. No concrete plan (method, timing, location, preparation) is mentioned, despite clear ideation.
*   **Ideation:** Present. The post clearly expresses a desire to die/not be alive, but lacks a plan.
*   **Indicator:** Not present as there is a clear active desire to die, not just general distress or rejected thoughts.

Based on the analysis, the highest risk category present is Ideation.

I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It mentions ""postpone any suicide attempts,"" which refers to future potential actions, not past ones. So, not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post clearly indicates suicidal thoughts: ""reason not to kill myself"", ""postpone any suicide attempts"".
    *   Is there a plan? The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so"" refers to a *delay* of potential future attempts, not a concrete plan for an action. The timing (""next decade or so"") is for the *postponement*, not for the act itself. Therefore, there is no active plan described. So, not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The phrases ""reason not to kill myself"" and ""postpone any suicide attempts"" explicitly indicate that the user has personal suicidal thoughts or tendencies. The user is actively seeking or finding reasons *not* to act on these thoughts. This goes beyond general distress and directly addresses the concept of suicide as a personal possibility. The underlying desire or tendency to die is implied by the need for a ""reason not to"" and the concept of ""postponing attempts."" This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   While the user is finding a reason *not* to act, they are not explicitly rejecting the thoughts as intrusive or unwanted (e.g., ""my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to""). Instead, they are acknowledging the presence of these thoughts/tendencies and finding a coping mechanism to delay them. The fact that they *need* a reason not to kill themselves suggests an underlying desire or strong consideration that is being managed, rather than simply rejected. This is stronger than 'Indicator'.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly references personal suicidal thoughts/tendencies that the user is actively managing by finding a reason to delay them. This indicates active suicidal ideation.

The user's post expresses a clear and direct desire to not be alive: ""I have absolutely no will to live anymore,"" and ""I just want to end it all."" This fulfills the criteria for Ideation.

I will now check if it meets the criteria for higher risk categories:
1.  **Attempt?** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not Attempt.
2.  **Behavior?** The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""no will to live anymore,"" ""want to end it all""). However, it does not mention any component of a plan, such as a specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not Behavior.
3.  **Ideation?** As established, the post clearly expresses a desire to no longer be alive or to die (""no will to live anymore,"" ""want to end it all"") without a concrete plan. This fits the definition of Ideation.
4.  **Indicator?** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want. They are expressing a direct desire to end their life. It is more than general distress; it is a stated desire to die. So, it's not Indicator.

Based on the hierarchy, Ideation is the highest applicable risk level.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed thinking process and definitions.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt (aborted or completed). So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts *and* mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)?
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    *   However, it does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, rope), timing (e.g., tonight, at 21), location (e.g., a bridge, at home), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye).
    *   Since there is no element of a plan, it is not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** Does the post express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life?
    *   The phrase ""I'm going to kill myself"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to end one's life. This goes beyond general sadness or hopelessness.
    *   This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** Is the user expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want?
    *   The post does not contain any phrases that negate the suicidal thought, such as ""but I don't actually want to"" or ""my brain tells me to, but I won't."" The statement ""I'm going to kill myself"" is presented as a personal intention.
    *   Therefore, it is not 'Indicator' based on negated thoughts.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above fit, it's general distress.
    *   This is not the case, as a clear desire to die is present.

Based on this analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die without any concrete plan, which aligns with the 'Ideation' category.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""Feel like dying again,"" ""Just kill me""). However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The phrases ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me"" explicitly express a desire to not be alive or to die. This is a clear, active desire.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is expressing a direct desire to die, not rejecting or negating intrusive thoughts. The desire is personal and active.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as the post clearly expresses an active suicidal desire.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die without any planning component, which aligns with the definition of Ideation.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined thinking process.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will look for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to ending their life.
    *   The user expresses a strong desire to ""leave this place"" and ""walk out,"" stating they would if they had money. This refers to physically leaving their apartment due to their distress and perceived harassment, not a plan for suicide.
    *   There is no mention of tools, substances, specific times for self-harm, locations for an act, or preparatory actions for suicide.
    *   Conclusion: No suicidal plan is present.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for explicit statements of wanting to die, not be alive, or end their life.
    *   The user states: ""I'm so tired. My heads messing with me. I just wanna leave this place... I cant take this torture from these people. I want to leave... I dont know what options I have left. I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs.""
    *   While there is profound distress, feelings of being trapped, hopelessness, and paranoia, there is no direct statement like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I want to end it all."" The desire to ""leave"" is tied to their living situation. The phrase ""I don't know what options I have left"" indicates a search for solutions to their current predicament, not necessarily a desire for death.
    *   Conclusion: No explicit active suicidal desire is present.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user mentions suicidal thoughts but rejects them.
    *   The post does not contain any mention of suicidal thoughts, whether accepted or negated.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** If none of the above categories fit, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die.
    *   The post clearly describes significant general distress, extreme sleep deprivation, paranoia (landlord, neighbors, ""everyone is in on it but me""), feelings of torture, and hopelessness regarding their living situation. They also mention a recent MS diagnosis which is ""hard to deal."" These are all strong indicators of mental health struggles and severe distress.
    *   This fits the definition of Indicator: ""The post shows general distress, hopelessness, or discusses suicide thematically but lacks a personal, active desire to die.""

Based on this analysis, the highest risk category present is Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt? No, it refers to a future ""possible suicide date.""

2.  **Check for Behavior:** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** The phrase ""Possible suicide date is in July"" clearly indicates suicidal thoughts/intent.
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Timing:** ""in July"" is a specific timeframe mentioned for the potential act.
    *   Since there are suicidal thoughts and a specific timing (a component of planning), this post fits the criteria for **Behavior**. The fact that the user is ""debating it"" does not negate the presence of the plan element (""Possible suicide date is in July"") which is a concrete detail. According to the rules, the presence of any plan element elevates it to Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Not applicable, as Behavior criteria were met).

4.  **Check for Indicator:** (Not applicable, as Behavior criteria were met).

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but does not include any concrete plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). In fact, it explicitly states ""I will probably never kill myself"".
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The user states ""Happy people makes me suicidal"" and ""have suicidal thoughts"". This initially points towards ideation. However, the critical part is ""but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better"". This explicitly negates the desire to act on the suicidal thoughts.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user clearly mentions suicidal thoughts (""have suicidal thoughts"") but then explicitly states they will not act on them (""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin""). This fits the definition of Indicator, where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post mentions ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year,"" which indicates past preparatory actions/ideation, but not a past physical act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not ""Attempt"" based on past action.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve."" and ""it would be an amazing way to end it, no?.""
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Timing:** ""on new year's eve"" is a specific future time.
        *   **Preparation:** ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" indicates past preparatory actions and a current intention to finalize a note.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation and components of a plan (timing and preparation), the category is **Behavior**.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is skipped because ""Behavior"" has already been identified as a higher risk.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is skipped because ""Behavior"" has already been identified as a higher risk.

The user's post describes a past action: ""I tried to cut myself last night.""
According to the ""Attempt"" definition: ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts (e.g., 'I put the belt around my neck but then stopped') and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting. The focus is on the past action.""
The phrase ""tried to cut myself"" directly falls under ""past act of self-harm"" and ""NSSI like cutting.""
Even though the user states ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"" and gives a reason (""wanted to feel something real""), the act itself is described as having occurred. The definition of ""Attempt"" explicitly includes NSSI.
Therefore, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

The user post states: ""I'm 15 and plan to kill myself, Why shouldn't i?. After having my girlfriend of 2 years lost feelings for me because i became toxic, it's made me notice that i have nothing and no one, i have no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living.""

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post explicitly states ""I'm 15 and plan to kill myself"". The direct use of the word ""plan"" indicates the presence of a formulated intention to act, which falls under the definition of ""Behavior"" even without specific details like method or timing. The user is expressing suicidal thoughts and directly stating they have a ""plan."" This meets the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Not applicable, as Behavior was identified, which is a higher risk category).
4.  **Check for Indicator:** (Not applicable, as Behavior was identified, which is a higher risk category).

Based on the explicit statement ""plan to kill myself,"" the highest risk category present is Behavior.

463,"Is it better to let folks know you'll be killing yourself soon or just surprise em will h it?. Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped. Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post expresses a clear intent to die: ""killing yourself soon."" This immediately rules out 'Indicator' as it's not general distress or negated thoughts.

Next, I evaluate if it fits 'Attempt'. The post describes a future action, not a past one, so it's not an 'Attempt'.

Now, I differentiate between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
'Ideation' is a desire to die without a plan.
'Behavior' includes a desire to die *and* a component of planning (method, timing, location, or preparation).

The phrase ""killing yourself soon"" contains both the desire to die and a specific timeframe (""soon""). While ""soon"" isn't a precise date, it indicates an expectation of the act happening within an imminent, albeit undefined, future. This constitutes a ""timing"" element of a plan, as per the definition: ""A plan can be a method, a specific timeframe, a location, or a preparatory act."" The user is also discussing the *process* of dying by suicide (""Is it better to let folks know... or just surprise em""), which implies a decision has been made and they are contemplating the execution.

Therefore, the presence of suicidal ideation combined with a timeframe (""soon"") and contemplation of the act's execution elevates it to 'Behavior'.

464,"Fuckkkkkkk I think I'll kill myself tonight. I'm so fucking tired of everything, god damn it, I want to kill myself so bad, I'll play my favorite music ever and hang myself at the woods, The End-The doors",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user's post explicitly states ""I think I'll kill myself tonight"" and ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" which clearly indicates active suicidal desire.
Next, I check for elements of a plan:
*   **Method:** ""hang myself"" - Yes, a specific method is mentioned.
*   **Timing:** ""tonight"" - Yes, a specific timeframe is mentioned.
*   **Location:** ""at the woods"" - Yes, a specific location is mentioned.
*   **Preparation:** ""I'll play my favorite music ever"" - Yes, a preparatory action is mentioned.

Since the post contains active suicidal ideation along with multiple components of a plan (method, timing, location, and preparation), it falls under the 'Behavior' category according to the hierarchy. There is no mention of a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

The user post expresses a clear desire to die: ""I want to kill myself.""
Next, I check for elements of a plan. The post states, ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching."" This is a specific timing for the act. Additionally, ""Already started to cancel friendships"" indicates preparatory actions.
Since there is active suicidal ideation (""I want to kill myself"") and multiple components of a plan (timing and preparation), the classification is Behavior.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post mentions suicidal thoughts (""i have to so i dont kill myself"", ""Is suicide really as bad...""), but it does not include any concrete plan (method, timing, location, or preparation). So, it's not 'behavior'.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post contains phrases like ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" and questions the severity of suicide (""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.""). This indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts or contemplation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The crucial phrase here is ""i have to so i dont kill myself"". This explicitly states that the user is taking an action (sleeping all day) *to prevent* themselves from committing suicide. This demonstrates that while suicidal thoughts are present, the user is actively resisting them and does not want to act on them. This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator' where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them. The question ""Is suicide really as bad..."" is a thematic contemplation, but the personal struggle is presented as one of active avoidance.

Based on the explicit statement of taking action to *prevent* suicide, the risk level is best classified as Indicator because the user is actively negating or resisting the suicidal impulse.

467,I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it. Thats it I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it simple as that,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses a desire to die (""I want to die"") but does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparation. The phrase ""too much of a coward to do it"" indicates a lack of current planning or intent to act.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post clearly and repeatedly states, ""I want to die."" This is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is *not* expressing suicidal thoughts that they do not agree with or want. They are stating a clear desire (""I want to die""). The ""too much of a coward"" part describes a personal barrier to acting on that desire, not a rejection of the desire itself.

Based on the hierarchy:
*   It's not an Attempt.
*   It's not Behavior because there's no plan.
*   It *is* Ideation because there's a clear, active desire to die.
*   It's not an Indicator because the desire to die is explicitly stated and not negated.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is Ideation.

But now i am at peace, no longer in pain, locked in the bathroom while my friends text me endlessly about how im ""ignoring"" them, but in reality i dont have the confidence to even say a word to them knowing it might as well be my last. Ive planned it all out, this is just a way of dying, knowing somebody noticed, and i feel cared about and worth it for the last few seconds i can ever memorize.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
The user post needs to be classified according to the suicide risk hierarchy.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""ive been suicidal since i was 9, i understood it, i self-harmed."" This explicitly describes a past act of self-harm. According to the definition, ""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt...This includes...non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting. The focus is on the past action."" The mention of ""i self-harmed"" fits this criterion. The Hierarchy Rule also states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" This post clearly mentions past self-harm and also current plans.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post contains active suicidal ideation (""decide to throw myself off a bridge,"" ""this might as well be my last,"" ""this is just a way of dying"") and a clear plan (""throw myself off a bridge"" - method and location; ""Ive planned it all out"" - explicit planning). This would classify it as Behavior if Attempt were not present.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** Not applicable, as there is a plan and past self-harm.

4.  **Check for Indicator:** Not applicable, as there is active suicidal desire, planning, and past self-harm.

**Applying Hierarchy:**
The post contains elements of both 'Attempt' (past self-harm) and 'Behavior' (current ideation with a plan). According to the hierarchy rule, ""If a post contains elements of multiple categories (e.g., a past attempt and current plans), you must classify it as the highest risk category present."" 'Attempt' is the highest risk category. Therefore, the presence of past self-harm, combined with current planning, leads to an 'Attempt' classification.

469,I'm gonna twist my dick off. I'm gonna commit suicide. I can't get a boner but I sure am gonna try here . I'm gonna wait it off a die of blood loss.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post describes future actions (""I'm gonna twist my dick off,"" ""I'm gonna commit suicide,"" ""I'm gonna wait it off a die of blood loss""), not a past act of self-harm or an attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post explicitly states ""I'm gonna commit suicide."" It also mentions a method: ""I'm gonna twist my dick off"" and ""die of blood loss."" The mention of a method, even if seemingly bizarre or graphic, constitutes a component of planning when combined with suicidal intent. This fits the definition of 'behavior'.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** While there is active suicidal desire (""I'm gonna commit suicide""), the presence of a method elevates it beyond just ideation.
4.  **Check for Indicator:** The user is not negating or rejecting the suicidal thoughts; they are stating an intention with a method.
5.  **Hierarchy Rule:** Since 'behavior' fits, and it's higher than 'ideation' or 'indicator', this is the correct classification.

470,Sayonara. My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker. I will eventually die in a much painful way. I endured the physical pain and mental depression for years. I am lonely and have no reason to live,0,indicator,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It talks about a disease getting worse and eventually dying from it, but this is not a self-initiated act or past attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses distress and a sense of impending death due to illness (""My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker. I will eventually die in a much painful way""). It also states ""I have no reason to live."" However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action for *suicide*. The ""eventually die"" refers to the progression of a disease, not a self-directed plan to end life.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The phrase ""I am lonely and have no reason to live"" explicitly expresses a desire to no longer be alive. ""Sayonara"" also implies a farewell or ending. This goes beyond general distress and indicates a clear desire to not continue living.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user does not negate or reject these thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't actually want to""). The statements are direct expressions of their current state and desire.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as a stronger category (Ideation) fits.

Based on the explicit statement ""I have no reason to live"" and the implied farewell ""Sayonara,"" which signify a desire to not be alive, but without any concrete plan or past attempt, the post falls into the **Ideation** category.

The user post needs to be classified based on the suicide risk hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation > Indicator.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt by the user. It mentions ""people dying/committing suicide successfully"" but this refers to others, not the user's past actions.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""Why can't that be me?"", ""Why do I get to carry on living and they get to die?"", ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"", ""I'll still be suicidal lol""). However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. The question ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"" followed by ""to which the answer is always no"" indicates contemplation, not a plan.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post clearly expresses a personal desire to not be alive or to die. Phrases like ""Why can't that be me? Why do I get to carry on living and they get to die?"" and ""I'll still be suicidal lol"" directly indicate a desire to die. This is stronger than general distress.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** While the user expresses self-judgment (""I know it is wrong and disgusting to think about yourself... This is turning me into a bad person and I need to stop""), they do *not* negate the suicidal thoughts or desire itself. They explicitly state, ""But I just couldn't help but think 'Why can't that be me?'"" and ""I'll still be suicidal lol,"" confirming the active desire. This is not an intrusive thought they are rejecting.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear, active desire to die without a concrete plan. This fits the definition of Ideation.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post states, ""Am I the only one who wants to die but is still afraid of stupid little things like going to hell or something?"" It expresses a desire to die but does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post explicitly states, ""Am I the only one who wants to die..."" This is a clear and direct expression of a desire to die.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user expresses a desire to die (""wants to die"") but is held back by a specific fear (""afraid of stupid little things like going to hell""). This is not a negation of the desire itself (e.g., ""I want to die, but I don't actually want to""). Instead, it describes a barrier preventing them from acting on that desire. The desire to die is still present and active. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for Indicator based on negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since an active suicidal desire (Ideation) is present, this step is not applicable.

**Final Classification Reasoning:** The post clearly expresses an active desire to die (""wants to die"") without describing any concrete plan. The fear of hell acts as a barrier to acting on this desire, but it does not negate the desire itself. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation. It is not an Attempt as no past action is described. It is not Behavior as no plan is articulated. It is not an Indicator because there is a clear, active personal desire to die, rather than general distress or rejected thoughts.

For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and steps.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother..."" This describes past *thoughts* or *ideation*, not a past physical act of self-harm or an aborted attempt. Therefore, it is not an Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post expresses significant distress and a feeling of being overwhelmed (""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore""). However, there is no mention of a specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions for suicide. Therefore, it is not Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The post does not contain explicit phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I'm going to end it all,"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" While the user expresses extreme distress and difficulty coping (""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore""), this is not a direct statement of a desire to die. The past mention of ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"" is immediately followed by a negation (""but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now""), indicating that these thoughts were not acted upon due to a protective factor. Therefore, it is not Ideation.

4.  **Check for Indicator (General Distress/Negated Thoughts):** The post clearly describes general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles (""crushed by stress,"" ""cried myself to sleep,"" ""crippled by stress and anxiety,"" ""no motivation,"" ""I need help and I can't get it from anywhere""). Crucially, it mentions past suicidal thoughts (""I thought of killing myself multiple times"") but explicitly states they were rejected or overridden by a protective factor (""but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now""). This aligns perfectly with the ""Crucial Rule"" for Indicator: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" The current feelings are of being overwhelmed and needing help, rather than an active desire to die.

Based on this analysis, the post fits the definition of Indicator.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?**
    *   The post asks, ""Where can I find out how to die."" This is an explicit request for a method. Actively seeking information on ""how to die"" is a preparatory step towards an act, and thus constitutes a component of planning.
    *   The phrase ""I just want to definitely die"" clearly expresses active suicidal desire.
    *   Since there is active suicidal desire and a clear component of planning (seeking a method/preparation), the classification is 'Behavior'.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** Yes, ""I just want to definitely die"" is a clear expression of ideation. However, the presence of a plan component (seeking a method) elevates it to 'Behavior'.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** No, the user is not negating their suicidal thoughts; they are actively pursuing them.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post based on the given hierarchy and definitions.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post states, ""I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail."" The phrase ""attempt again"" explicitly indicates a past suicide attempt. According to the rules, if a post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt, it falls under the 'Attempt' category. Furthermore, the ""Hierarchy Rule"" states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" This post clearly mentions a past attempt and also expresses current ideation (""not because I want to be alive,"" ""will to die"") and a future timing component (""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out""). Therefore, the highest risk category present is Attempt.

2.  **Check for Behavior:** (Skipped because Attempt is present and is higher risk). If Attempt were not present, I would look for ideation plus a plan. The post has clear ideation (""will to die"") and a timing component (""at least a few months out""), which would classify it as Behavior.

3.  **Check for Ideation:** (Skipped because Attempt is present and is higher risk). The post contains clear expressions of wanting to die or not wanting to be alive (""not because I want to be alive,"" ""I just don't really want one either"" (referring to a future), ""will to die"").

4.  **Check for Indicator:** (Skipped because higher risk categories are present). The user does not negate their suicidal thoughts; rather, they express a persistent ""will to die.""

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of a past attempt (""attempt again"") combined with current ideation and future planning elevates the classification to 'Attempt'.

The user post expresses a clear desire to die: ""I haven't thought about anything other than how and when I'm going to take my life,"" ""It's peaceful to think about, to imagine myself free from everything,"" ""I just want the pain to stop."" This indicates active suicidal ideation.

Next, I need to check for elements of a plan. The post explicitly mentions:
*   **Method**: ""gun to the head"" and ""kitchen knife.""
*   **Timing**: ""Going by my plan, I still need to wait another 480 days until I'm able to."" This is a specific future timing.
*   **Urgency/Alternative Plan**: ""But I can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there."" This implies an immediate and alternative plan due to increasing distress.
*   **Location**: ""do it there"" (referring to using the kitchen knife, implying the current location).

Because the post contains both active suicidal ideation and multiple elements of a plan (method, timing, implied location, and explicit mention of ""my plan""), it falls into the 'Behavior' category. It does not describe a past attempt. It does not negate the suicidal thoughts.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** There is no mention of a past suicide attempt or self-harm.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** While ""thoughts of suicide"" are mentioned, there is absolutely no plan (method, timing, location, preparation) expressed. Instead, the user is inquiring about treatment options.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post states ""Did anyone having thoughts of suicide benefit from inpatient care?"" which indicates the user is experiencing such thoughts. However, the subsequent sentences clarify the user's intent: ""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live, and figure out what steps to take."" and ""convincing myself I deserve to live"". This strongly indicates a desire to *live* and seek help, rather than an active desire to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user explicitly mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" but then immediately follows up with a clear statement of trying to ""find the courage to actually live"" and seeking solutions (""figure out what steps to take,"" ""Does inpatient care help?""). This fits the definition of Indicator, where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them, by actively seeking help to live. The core struggle is about convincing themselves they deserve to live, not expressing a desire to die.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** The post expresses distress and mental health struggles, and while it mentions suicidal thoughts, it frames them in the context of seeking help to *overcome* them and *live*. This aligns perfectly with the Indicator category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the prescribed step-by-step thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I'm really going to try and kill myself"".
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   Timing: Yes, ""on Monday"".
        *   Location: Yes, ""Bridge"".
        *   Method: ""Bridge"" implies jumping, which is a method.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation (""I'm really going to try and kill myself"") and elements of a plan (timing: ""on Monday""; location/method: ""Bridge""), this post fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** This step is skipped because 'Behavior' has already been identified, which is a higher risk category than 'Ideation'.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** This step is skipped because 'Behavior' has already been identified.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** This step is skipped because 'Behavior' has already been identified.

Based on the hierarchy and the presence of both suicidal ideation and a concrete plan (timing and location/method), the highest risk category applicable is 'Behavior'.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. Phrases like ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" or ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" refer to future actions or conditions for future actions, not past attempts.
    *   *Conclusion: Not 'Attempt'.*

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   **Method:** ""Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track"" implies a method, even if it's symbolic or later changed. It was put there as a reminder/motivation for ""kms.""
    *   **Timing:** No specific timing is mentioned.
    *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
    *   **Preparation:**
        *   ""Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track"" can be interpreted as a form of mental preparation or commitment to a method.
        *   ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" indicates the removal of an obstacle or a step taken towards being able to ""kms."" This is a form of preparation.
        *   ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" explicitly states a condition being met that clears the path for the act, which is a form of preparation.
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation (""kms,"" ""before I go"") and includes multiple elements of preparation and an implied method.
    *   *Conclusion: This fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.*

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** (This step is technically skipped if 'Behavior' is identified, but for completeness, the post clearly expresses active suicidal desire: ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms,"" ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it,"" ""Wish I have more sex before I go though lol."")

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating their suicidal thoughts; they are discussing conditions, preparations, and the difficulty of the decision to ""kms.""
    *   *Conclusion: Not 'Indicator'.*

Based on the hierarchy, since elements of planning/preparation are present alongside clear ideation, the highest risk category is Behavior.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process and definitions.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. So, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""I want to die""), but it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post initially states, ""I want to die."" This would typically point towards 'Ideation'. However, I must proceed to the next step as per the instructions.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The post contains a crucial sentence: ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore."" This explicitly negates the earlier statement ""I want to die."" The rule states: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them (e.g., intrusive or unwanted thoughts)."" The user is expressing a desire to escape their current self/pain (""I don't want to be me anymore"") while explicitly stating they do *not* want to die. This fits the definition of 'Indicator' due to the clear rejection of the suicidal thought. The overall sentiment is one of extreme distress, hopelessness, and a plea for help, without a stated active desire to die when considering the full context.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the user explicitly negates the desire to die, despite mentioning it, the highest appropriate category based on the rules is 'Indicator'.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the hierarchical thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior):** The post states ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with."" This expresses suicidal thoughts. However, it does not mention a specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post contains phrases like ""Can't take it anymore,"" ""I feel like he'll be better off without me,"" and most directly, ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with."" The phrase ""getting it over with"" in this context clearly signifies a desire to end one's life. This goes beyond general distress and expresses a clear desire to not be alive.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is expressing their own thoughts and feelings of wanting to ""get it over with,"" not thoughts that they are rejecting or do not agree with.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear active suicidal desire without any concrete plan, which fits the definition of 'ideation'.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user post describes multiple past suicide attempts: taking aspirin at 15, an aborted gun attempt at 21, and an aborted hanging attempt recently.

Crucially, the post also describes a *current* action: ""Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly... When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock."" This describes the initiation of a suicidal act (turning on the gas for an exit bag) which was then stopped due to panic. This is an aborted attempt that happened *today*.

According to the definition, ""Attempt: The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes aborted attempts... The focus is on the past action."" The ""today"" action, even if aborted, is a past action relative to the moment of writing the post, and it is a clear attempt.

The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Since the post details multiple past attempts and describes a very recent, initiated, and then aborted attempt, the highest risk category is Attempt.

483,Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile. I'm a garbage person who should just end my life for my benefit and the benefit of those around me. I'm just a leech who will never accomplish anything.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will examine the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparatory actions related to ending one's life.
    *   The post states, ""who should just end my life,"" but it does not specify *how*, *when*, *where*, or any *preparation*.
    *   Therefore, this post does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will now look for explicit expressions of a desire to die, not be alive, or end one's life.
    *   The phrase ""who should just end my life"" is a direct and active statement of a belief or desire that one's life should end. This is a clear expression of suicidal ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** Before concluding it's Ideation, I will check if the user is expressing these thoughts but rejecting them.
    *   The user states ""I should just end my life,"" which implies agreement or a conviction, not a rejection (e.g., ""my brain tells me to, but I don't want to"").
    *   Therefore, this is not an Indicator due to negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since active suicidal desire (Ideation) was identified, the post does not default to Indicator.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses a clear desire/belief about ending one's life (""should just end my life"") without any concrete plan. This aligns with the definition of Ideation.

484,I'm about to kill myself. I don't see a reason to live. Life sucks.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user post states: ""I'm about to kill myself. I don't see a reason to live. Life sucks.""

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The phrase ""I'm about to kill myself"" indicates a strong, immediate intent to act. While it doesn't specify a method, location, or detailed preparation, the ""about to"" signifies a very specific and imminent timeframe. This immediacy (""about to"") functions as a component of planning, similar to ""tonight"" or ""at 21"" in the examples provided for Behavior. It suggests the user is on the verge of taking action.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** ""I'm about to kill myself"" clearly expresses an active desire to end one's life. ""I don't see a reason to live"" and ""Life sucks"" reinforce this desire and hopelessness. This definitely meets the criteria for Ideation.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** There is no negation or rejection of the suicidal thoughts. The user is stating them as their current, active intent.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher categories fit.

**Hierarchy Check:**
*   **Attempt:** No past action or attempt is described.
*   **Behavior:** The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""I'm about to kill myself"") and a component of planning in the form of an imminent timeframe (""about to""). This elevates it from Ideation to Behavior. The phrase ""about to"" implies an immediate, specific timing for the act, which is a criterion for Behavior.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The user expresses a clear desire to ""face death"" and states a specific action: ""I'm now gonna start working out until i die or pass out"". This describes a *method* (working out to exhaustion/death) and an immediate *timing* (""now""). The phrase ""i'll be back in 12 hours if i survived to tell you how it went, if not, well, you know what happened"" further reinforces a timeframe and a clear expectation of death if the plan is successful. This combination of suicidal desire and a concrete plan (method and timing) fits the definition of Behavior.
2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrases ""face death"" and ""working out until i die"" clearly express an active desire to die.
3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating their thoughts; they are stating a clear intent and plan.
4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable as higher risk categories are present.

Given the presence of both suicidal desire and a specific plan (method and timing), the highest applicable risk level is Behavior.

The user is asking me to classify the suicide risk level of the provided social media post. I will follow the defined hierarchy and thinking process.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** Does the post describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt?
    *   The post states, ""I have contemplated suicide for years,"" but it does not describe any past physical action or attempt.
    *   *Conclusion: Not an Attempt.*

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** Does the post express suicidal thoughts and mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation)?
    *   **Suicidal thoughts:** The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts: ""I have contemplated suicide for years, I know I am going to do it,"" and ""I plan to be dead long before I retire."" This is clear ideation.
    *   **Plan elements:**
        *   **Method:** No specific method is mentioned.
        *   **Timing:** The user states, ""im unsure how long that will take maybe in my 20's or 30's"" and ""long before I retire."" This provides a future timeframe for the intended act. The examples given for Behavior include ""I plan to kill myself at 21,"" which is analogous to specifying ""in my 20's or 30's"" as a future window.
        *   **Location:** No specific location is mentioned.
        *   **Preparation:** No preparatory actions are mentioned.
    *   Since there is clear suicidal ideation (""I know I am going to do it,"" ""I plan to be dead"") combined with a specific, albeit broad, future timeframe (""in my 20's or 30's,"" ""long before I retire""), this meets the criteria for Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** (This step is only if it's not an Attempt or Behavior).
    *   The post *does* express active suicidal desire, but because a plan element (timing) was identified, the risk level is elevated to Behavior.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** (This step is only if it's not an Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation).
    *   The user is not negating or rejecting the thoughts; they are stating a clear intention (""I know I am going to do it"").
    *   *Conclusion: Not an Indicator.*

**Hierarchy Rule Application:** The post contains clear ideation and a component of planning (timing). According to the hierarchy, Behavior is a higher risk than Ideation.

**Final Classification Decision:** The presence of a clear intention to die (""I know I am going to do it,"" ""I plan to be dead"") combined with a future timeframe (""in my 20's or 30's,"" ""long before I retire"") classifies this post as Behavior.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt?** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It asks a question about lethality and mentions saving pills for a future, implied purpose.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior)?**
    *   **Method:** The post explicitly mentions ""duloxetine"" and ""a few pills,"" indicating a specific method.
    *   **Timing:** ""saving for later"" implies a future intent, though not a precise time.
    *   **Location:** Not specified.
    *   **Preparation:** ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later."" This is a clear preparatory action. The user has acquired and is holding onto a means, linking it directly to the question of lethality. This constitutes preparation for a potential act.
    *   Since a method and preparation are present, this qualifies as Behavior. The question ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" combined with ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" strongly implies suicidal ideation coupled with a plan (method and preparation).
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation)?** The question ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" in conjunction with ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" implies a desire to die and is exploring a means to do so. However, since a plan component is present, it's elevated beyond Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator)?** The user is not negating or rejecting the thoughts; they are actively inquiring about a method and stating preparation.

Based on the presence of a specific method (duloxetine/pills) and a preparatory action (saving them for later), the post fits the criteria for Behavior.

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The user states, ""I just want to end but haven't yet."" This explicitly indicates that an attempt has not occurred. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a desire to ""end"" (""I just want to end""). Now, I need to check for any elements of a plan (method, timing, location, preparation).
    *   Method: Not mentioned.
    *   Timing: Not mentioned.
    *   Location: Not mentioned.
    *   Preparation: Not mentioned.
    Since there is no plan component, it is not 'Behavior'.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The post contains the phrase ""I just want to end"". This is a direct and active expression of a desire to no longer be alive or to die. It is not negated by ""but haven't yet,"" which only refers to the *action* of ending, not the *desire* to end. This fits the definition of Ideation.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The desire ""I just want to end"" is a personal, active desire, not an intrusive thought that the user is rejecting. The user is clearly stating their own desire.

5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since 'Ideation' fits, I do not default to 'Indicator'.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to end their life without any concrete plan, which falls under 'Ideation'.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe a past suicide attempt or act of self-harm. It discusses a *potential* future action (""If I just put my mind to it I could be dead..."").
2.  **Check for Behavior:**
    *   **Active Suicidal Desire:** The user explicitly states ""If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today"" and ""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas."" This clearly indicates a personal, active desire to die or end their life.
    *   **Plan Elements:**
        *   **Timing:** ""by the end of the day today"" is a specific timeframe.
        *   **Method/Preparation:** ""go buy the gas"" implies a specific method (e.g., self-immolation, carbon monoxide poisoning) and a preparatory action (acquiring the means).
    *   Since both active suicidal desire and elements of a plan (timing, method/preparation) are present, the post fits the ""Behavior"" category.

The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the given social media post.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt. So, it's not 'attempt'.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):** The post says ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already."" While ""do it"" clearly refers to suicide, there is no mention of a specific method, timing, location, or preparatory action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.
3.  **Check for Ideation (Active Suicidal Desire):** The phrases ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" express a clear, active desire to end their life. The user is contemplating or pushing themselves towards the act. This goes beyond general distress and indicates a personal desire to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The user is not rejecting the suicidal thoughts; rather, they are expressing frustration at *not* acting on them, implying a desire to act. This is not an intrusive thought they want to get rid of.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** Since 'Ideation' fits, it does not default to 'indicator'.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die without any specific plan, which aligns with the 'Ideation' category.

I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November.

The user's post needs to be classified based on the provided suicide risk hierarchy. I will go through the categories from most severe to least severe.

1.  **Check for Attempt**: The post states, ""During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself)."" This explicitly describes a past act of self-harm, which falls under the definition of ""Attempt"" (""The post describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. This includes...non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) like cutting.""). The hierarchy rule states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""

2.  **Check for Behavior**: The post contains clear elements of a plan: ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car."" This includes a method (hang myself, axe), location (highest tree of the forest), and preparation (rope, axe, car ready). This would classify as Behavior if there were no past attempt.

3.  **Check for Ideation**: The post states, ""but now it time to stop the lie and end it."" This expresses a desire to end one's life. This would classify as Ideation if there were no plan or past attempt.

4.  **Check for Indicator**: The post expresses distress and suicidal thoughts, but it also contains much more severe elements.

Since the post explicitly describes a past act of self-harm (cutting), even though it also describes current detailed plans, the highest risk category according to the provided hierarchy rule is ""Attempt"". The rule explicitly states: ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt.""

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, or preparation) for ending one's life.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** The post contains the phrase ""I wish I was never born,"" which could be interpreted as a passive desire not to exist. However, it immediately follows with ""but at the same time don't really want to die."" This explicit negation of a desire to die means it does not fit the definition of Ideation, which requires a clear desire to no longer be alive or to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The post expresses thoughts related to not wanting to be alive (""I wish I was never born"") but explicitly rejects the desire to die (""but at the same time don't really want to die""). This aligns perfectly with the Indicator definition: ""This category includes posts where the user mentions suicidal thoughts but clearly rejects them or states they do not want to act on them."" The post also expresses general distress and hopelessness about the meaning of life, which are characteristics of an Indicator.

493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you.

1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past acts of self-harm or suicide attempts. It focuses on current shame and anxiety.
2.  **Check for Behavior:** The post does not express any suicidal thoughts or a plan (method, timing, location, preparation). It describes social anxiety and shame.
3.  **Check for Ideation:** The post does not express a desire to die, to not be alive, or to end one's life. Phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead"" are absent. The user is asking for help with a social/personal problem, not expressing suicidal intent.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts:** The post does not mention any suicidal thoughts, intrusive or otherwise.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** The post expresses significant distress, shame, and anxiety (""I really need help,"" ""I am very ashamed,"" ""everyone knows about it and makes fun about me,"" ""I am afraid of everyone will think of me""). This aligns with the definition of general distress and hopelessness without a stated desire to die.

494,families are really selfish. they bought u into this world and then you suddenly get sick of it. and they dont let you kill yourself. what kind of an asshole move is that?why do you want me to suffer just for your well being and your pleasure? what the fuck is wrong with you?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe any past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** The post expresses a desire to ""kill yourself"" (""they dont let you kill yourself""), which indicates suicidal thoughts. However, it does not mention any specific method, timing, location, or preparatory actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** The phrase ""they dont let you kill yourself"" clearly indicates a personal desire to end one's life, which is being prevented by others. The user is expressing frustration at not being allowed to die. This is an explicit expression of a desire to no longer be alive or to die.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not expressing suicidal thoughts that they reject or do not want. Instead, they are expressing a desire to act on these thoughts, but are being prevented. This is not an intrusive thought scenario.

Based on this analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die without a concrete plan, fitting the definition of Ideation.

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for Attempt:** The post does not describe any past self-harm or suicide attempt.
2.  **Check for Behavior (Plan):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""pls fucking end me"" is a clear expression of a desire to die.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan (method, timing, location, preparation)? Yes, ""before the day"" specifies a timing element. This indicates a desire for the act to occur within a specific, immediate timeframe.
    *   Since there is active suicidal ideation and a timing component, this fits the definition of Behavior.
3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** While there is active suicidal desire, the presence of a timing element elevates it beyond Ideation.
4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** The user is not negating their thoughts; they are actively expressing a desire to die with a timeframe.
5.  **Default to Indicator:** This is not applicable as higher risk categories are identified.

Based on the hierarchy, the presence of both suicidal ideation (""pls fucking end me"") and a timing element (""before the day"") classifies this post as Behavior.

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user wants me to classify the suicide risk level of the post: ""There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.""

1.  **Check for an Attempt:** The post does not describe a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. It expresses a future hope. So, not 'attempt'.

2.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior):**
    *   Does the post express suicidal thoughts? Yes, ""I hope it'll be me next"" clearly indicates a desire to die.
    *   Does it mention any form of plan?
        *   **Method:** The post mentions ""stabbings"" as the desired way to die (""I hope it'll be me next""). While the user isn't planning to *perform* the stabbing themselves, they are expressing a specific *method* by which they wish to die, specifically to avoid the stigma of suicide. This is a desired method for their death.
        *   Timing: No specific timing.
        *   Location: ""in my area"" is too general to be a specific location for a plan.
        *   Preparation: No preparation mentioned.
    *   Because a specific *method* (being stabbed) is expressed as the desired way to die, even if passive, it constitutes a component of a plan. This elevates the risk from Ideation to Behavior.

3.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation):** If a plan wasn't present, the phrase ""I hope it'll be me next"" would clearly fall under Ideation, as it expresses a desire to not be alive.

4.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator):** The thoughts are not negated; they are actively expressed as a hope.

Based on the presence of a clear desire to die and a specific, desired method (""stabbings""), the classification is Behavior.

497,"how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?. okay so i will go straight to the point and i dont want any affection or ""oh dont do that your life is more worth than that and blablabla"" im 19 i have 0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money, i want to put an end to it all but there is something blocking me to do that and ots my family, how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it? maybe was just an accident idk, thanks and sorry for the bad english",1,ideation,"<thinking>
The user is asking for a classification of the suicide risk level. I need to follow the provided thinking process and definitions.

1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):**
    *   The post asks ""how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?"". This indicates seeking a method or conditions for suicide.
    *   The user explicitly states: ""i want to put an end to it all"".
    *   They then elaborate on a desired scenario/preparation: ""how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it?"". This describes a preparatory action (disappearing, getting a new identity, going to another country) to enable the act of suicide privately and peacefully. This aligns with the ""Preparation"" element of a plan, as it outlines actions to set the stage for the act.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):**
    *   ""how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?"" - Yes, explicit desire to die.
    *   ""i want to put an end to it all"" - Yes, explicit desire to end life.
    *   ""so i can just kill myself with peace"" - Yes, explicit desire to die.
    *   Active suicidal desire is clearly present.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):**
    *   The user mentions ""but there is something blocking me to do that and ots my family"". This is a *reason not to act* or an *obstacle*, not a *rejection* of the suicidal thoughts themselves. The desire to die remains strong and active; the family is merely a barrier preventing immediate action. This does not qualify as negated thoughts.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Not applicable, as higher risk categories are present.

**Final Classification Determination:**
The post contains clear active suicidal desire (""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all"") and describes a preparatory scenario/action (""how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it?""). This combination of ideation and a component of planning (preparation) elevates the risk to 'Behavior'.

498,"I'm still here, but I had enough of this. Hey there. Unfortunately, I'm still alive. I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets, but EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF, I FUCKING BREATHE. WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY!. I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!. THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!. I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful. This is the least pain-proof way I could die. Oh, and one more thing. If God doesn't take me to Heaven, then he's a dumb, selfless bitch. People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
The user's post describes a past action: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets"". This clearly fits the definition of an ""Attempt"" as it describes a past act of self-harm or a suicide attempt. The post also includes current ideation (""I had enough of this,"" ""THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!"") and current plans (""I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful""). According to the hierarchy rule, ""If a post mentions a past attempt AND current plans/ideation, the category is Attempt."" Therefore, the presence of the described past attempt immediately classifies the post as Attempt, as it is the highest risk category.

499,"Just don't want to get out of bed. I've got a lot to be happy about right now, I'm playing rugby with a very inclusive team, I'm starting my second year at uni in 3 weeks, I have an amazing bf and an awesome best friend and I'm 4 months on hrt . I'm just soooo tierd, I just want to sleep 24/7, I feel empty and I'm worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **Check for a Plan (Behavior?):** I will examine the post for any mention of a method, timing, location, or preparation related to suicide. The user states, ""I just want to sleep 24/7,"" which expresses extreme fatigue and a desire for rest/escape, but it is not a suicidal plan. There is no mention of tools, specific times for an act, locations, or preparatory actions for ending their life. Therefore, this is not 'Behavior'.

2.  **Check for Active Suicidal Desire (Ideation?):** I will look for phrases that explicitly express a desire to not be alive, to die, or to end one's life (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I want to end it all""). The post says, ""I'm just soooo tierd, I just want to sleep 24/7, I feel empty and I'm worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode."" While these are signs of distress and potential depression, they do not explicitly state a desire to die or end their life. ""I just want to sleep 24/7"" is a strong desire for escape or profound rest, but it does not equate to a desire for death. Therefore, this is not 'Ideation'.

3.  **Check for Negated Thoughts (Indicator?):** I will check if the user mentions suicidal thoughts but explicitly rejects them (e.g., ""My brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to.""). The post does not mention any suicidal thoughts, whether negated or otherwise.

4.  **Default to Indicator:** Since the post does not fit 'Attempt', 'Behavior', or 'Ideation', I will check if it expresses general distress, hopelessness, or mental health struggles without a stated desire to die. The user expresses being ""soooo tierd,"" feeling ""empty,"" not wanting to ""get out of bed,"" and being ""worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode."" These are clear signs of general distress, hopelessness, and mental health struggles. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator'.
