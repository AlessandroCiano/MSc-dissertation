0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""ending my life again,"" ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Never will find love,"" ""everything in my life is crap,"" ""I hate being myself""), despair (""mental breakdown""), self-loathing (""I hate being gay and I hate being myself"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""go to a bridge and jump off"" clearly states a specific location and method.
    - References to past actions: ""ending my life again"" suggests past suicidal thoughts or ideation, but no concrete past *action* is described. The focus is on current thoughts and a future plan.
    - Imminence: Not specified as immediate (e.g., ""tonight""), but the desire and plan are present.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/end life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""ending my life"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off,"" which is a clear desire to die.
    - The writer is expressing a personal desire to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""jump off"") and location (""a bridge"") are mentioned. This constitutes a specific plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current intention (""Kind of thinking about ending my life again,"" ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"").
    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. The phrase ""again"" refers to thoughts/ideation, not a completed or interrupted action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and a desire to die.
    - It's not 'Ideation' because there is a specific plan/method (""go to a bridge and jump off"") mentioned, which goes beyond just thoughts or desire.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action is described. The post describes a *current* desire and a *future* plan, not a past action.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts/desire *and* a specific plan/method (bridge, jump) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""I'm going to die soon""
    - Emotional indicators: ""inconsolable"" (suggests extreme distress, hopelessness, despair).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""soon"" indicates a near-future intention or belief.
    - Assessed desire: The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" in the context of being ""inconsolable"" strongly implies a personal desire for death or a belief that death is imminent due to their despair, rather than an unwanted thought or a medical prediction.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going to die soon"" combined with ""inconsolable"" indicates a clear personal expression of despair leading to an expectation or desire for imminent death. It's not merely abstract or unwanted thoughts.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the statement is declarative of an outcome.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state (""inconsolable"") and a future intention/belief (""I'm going to die soon"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's a statement of intent/belief, not a description of an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress (""inconsolable"") by stating ""I'm going to die soon,"" which, in this context, implies a personal desire for death or a belief in imminent self-inflicted death. This is stronger than 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The content expresses explicit personal feelings and a strong desire/belief about imminent death, without a plan. This aligns with 'Ideation'.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No explicit mentions of these.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I hate living"" expresses strong negative feelings about life, despair, and a lack of desire to continue living. ""sometime i think about why i have to live until now"" indicates a profound questioning of existence and a wish for it to end.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: No mention of past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: No specific temporal markers related to an action.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrase ""I hate living"" and questioning ""why i have to live until now"" strongly implies a desire to not be alive or a profound aversion to life, which is a form of suicidal ideation. It's not expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts; it's expressing a personal negative sentiment about their own existence.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hate living"" and ""why i have to live until now"" strongly convey a desire to not be alive or profound dissatisfaction with life to the point of questioning its continuation. This is a personal expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post expresses the thoughts as personal feelings.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current feeling (""I hate living"") and a recurring thought (""sometime i think about..."").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because ""I hate living"" and ""why i have to live until now"" are strong personal expressions of a desire to not be alive or a profound questioning of the value of their own life. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' which includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""Help me kill myself"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The plea ""Help me"" suggests distress and a desperate desire for assistance in carrying out the act.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal"" explicitly names a specific substance/method (barbiturates/Nembutal) and indicates a clear step towards acquiring the means, which counts as preparation/method identification.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the active request for help in finding means suggests a current and potentially imminent intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a very clear and direct stated desire to die by suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Help me kill myself.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively seeking help to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""barbiturates/Nembutal"" is a specific substance/method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The request to ""find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal"" is a clear step towards acquiring the means, which is a form of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention to commit suicide and a request for help with future preparation/action.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's about acquiring means for a future act, not a past initiated attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die by suicide (""Help me kill myself""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by explicitly mentioning a specific method (""barbiturates/Nembutal"") and seeking assistance in acquiring it, which constitutes a plan/method/preparation. This rules out 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not describe a past or very recent initiated action that was potentially lethal. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific method and active steps towards preparation (seeking means) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Is there a painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever,"" ""how to die with certainty and without pain.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""struggling,"" ""unmotivated,"" ""feel so sorry for them,"" ""selfish,"" ""lazy ass,"" ""world scares me,"" ""fear intimacy,"" ""feel worthless,"" ""tired.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post *asks* about a painless way to die and how to die, indicating a search for a method, but does not state a specific method they intend to use or have acquired. No tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide attempts.

    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire to die (""I want to sleep forever,"" ""Is there a painless way to die""). This is not distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a genuine desire to find a way to end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but it explicitly asks about ""dying"" and expresses a desire to ""sleep forever"" in a context of ending life.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, absolutely. ""I want to sleep forever,"" ""Is there a painless way to die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively seeking information on *how* to die, implying a desire to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The post is a general inquiry about *how* to die painlessly and certainly, not a statement of a specific method they have chosen or acquired.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:

    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I want to sleep forever,"" ""Is there a painless way to die""). This rules out 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., ""I'm going to take X pills,"" ""I'm going to jump from Y bridge,"" ""I've written a note""). The post *asks* about a way to die but doesn't state *their* specific chosen way or any steps taken. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' because it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die, but without a concrete plan, method, or preparation being stated. The question ""Is there a painless way to die"" indicates a search for a method, but not the adoption of one.

    *   **Assessing writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states ""i still want to die"" and ""i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways,"" and poses the question ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves if none of this matters"".

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it,"" ""I want it to stop."" These phrases clearly indicate a desire to end life.

    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""tonight"" is stated twice, indicating immediate intent.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, strong desire to die and not survive. It is not about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words, but phrases like ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" and ""I don't wanna survive it"" are direct and clear expressions of a desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there is a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it leans towards 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""tonight"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal, current expression of desire to die (""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it""). It's not abstract or unwanted thoughts.
    - It fits 'Ideation' because it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, with a strong sense of imminence (""tonight"").
    - It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The ""how"" is missing.
    - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent initiated action is described.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""ugly and stupid and not good enough,"" ""tiring,"" ""tired and lonely.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** Not applicable, as it describes ongoing intrusive thoughts.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Crucially, the writer states, ""but I don't actually want to."" This indicates that the suicidal thoughts are intrusive and unwanted, not a genuine personal desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The writer explicitly negates this desire (""but I don't actually want to"").
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""but I don't actually want to."" This is a key differentiator.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current, ongoing intrusive thoughts and emotional distress.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post mentions suicidal thoughts (""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself"").
    *   However, the critical phrase ""but I don't actually want to"" indicates that these are unwanted, intrusive thoughts, and the author does not personally desire to act on them or to die.
    *   According to the definition of 'Indicator': ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to')."" This perfectly matches the post's content.
    *   'Ideation' would require a clear personal desire to die. 'Behavior' would require a plan/method. 'Attempt' would require a past initiated action. None of these apply.
    *   Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate classification.

    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die now, right now in this instant.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present and personal.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""knife"" (with the context of running towards a cop) and ""opioids"" (with the context of finding a dealer).
    - Are there signs of preparation? ""Find a dealer with some opioids"" implies a preparatory action to acquire means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention. The methods described (""either i run... or find..."") are potential future actions.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes *potential future actions*, not a past initiated attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond 'Indicator' because it has explicit personal suicidal intent (""kill myself,"" ""want to die now"").
    - It goes beyond 'Ideation' because it explicitly mentions specific methods/plans (""run towards a cop with a knife,"" ""find a dealer with some opioids""). These are not just vague thoughts but concrete options being considered.
    - It is not 'Attempt' because it describes future plans/methods, not a past initiated action.
    - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal desire combined with specific methods/plans places it in the 'Behavior' category.

The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""I just want to get it over with"" combined with ""The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it"" strongly indicates a desire to end their life, implying suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""It's not working anymore,"" ""haven't slept in weeks,"" ""deteriorating,"" ""can't tell anyone,"" ""refuse to be sent back to a mental hospital against my will."" These show severe distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not explicitly stated as ""tonight"" or ""soon,"" but the current state is described as ""deteriorating,"" suggesting an ongoing and worsening crisis.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear wish to ""get it over with,"" and the fear is about the pain of the act, not about the desire itself being unwanted. This indicates a genuine desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to get it over with"" in the context of their suffering and the contemplation of ""going through with it"" (referring to the act of ending their life) indicates a clear desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is contemplating the act and its pain, not expressing that the thoughts are unwanted.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current severe distress and a current/future intention to ""get it over with.""
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I just want to get it over with,"" ""if I go through with it""). This eliminates 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This means it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This means it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings or a desire to not be alive any longer, without a specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

But then I realize I push people away unintentionally because I already have the mind frame of they will leave so it's more like ""let's get this over with"". and the ones who are reluctant to stay I don't necessarily give them a reason to. so shucks, I'd leave too. I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post contains the phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"". This is a metaphorical expression indicating a strong desire to escape one's current self or existence, which is a form of wanting to not be alive or to be gone. No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or specific methods/means.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fucked up way to feel,"" ""no one sticks around,"" ""everyone leaves you eventually,"" ""I push people away unintentionally,"" ""it still hurts."" These indicate deep emotional pain, loneliness, feelings of abandonment, self-blame, and hopelessness regarding relationships. The phrase ""let's get this over with"" in the context of people leaving suggests resignation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are described.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No imminence stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" expresses a personal, albeit metaphorical, desire to escape their own being, which aligns with a desire to not exist or not be alive.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" strongly implies a desire to escape one's own existence or current state of being, which is a clear personal desire to not be in their current state of life/self. This is a personal expression of a desire to be gone or cease to exist in their current form. Yes.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is presented as a personal feeling, not an unwanted thought.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current internal state, feelings, and a present desire (""I always think,"" ""I'd leave myself if I could"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal distress and a desire to escape oneself (""I'd leave myself if I could""). This goes beyond general sadness or abstract discussion of suicide. It is a personal wish to not be in their current state of being, which aligns with a desire to not be alive or to be gone.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The personal desire to ""leave myself"" is stronger than what typically defines 'Indicator' (which is for general distress or unwanted thoughts). It represents a genuine, albeit metaphorical, personal expression of wanting to cease to be in one's current state. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states, ""i plan to kill myself at 21"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""not ok,"" ""severely codependent,"" ""can't think for myself,"" ""no sense of self,"" ""constant anxiety,"" ""self doubt,"" ""mistrust,"" ""feel really small, like a child,"" ""very unhealthy,"" ""don't know what to do,"" ""my brain is so empty,"" ""apathetic and passive,"" ""no creativity,"" ""not fixable,"" ""no hope,"" ""braindead,"" ""only getting worse,"" ""too late,"" ""constant loneliness,"" ""anhedonic and dissociative,"" ""this is hell."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, anhedonia, and feelings of being a burden/incapable.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions a *plan* in terms of timing (""at 21""). However, it does not specify a method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) or any preparations being taken (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide attempts.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: The plan is set for ""at 21"" (currently 18), indicating a future, but specific, intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""i plan to kill myself at 21, whether i want to or not"". While the ""whether i want to or not"" adds a layer of complexity, the primary statement is ""i plan to kill myself,"" indicating a firm intention or decision, possibly born out of resignation due to the overwhelming despair (""no hope,"" ""not fixable"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""i plan to kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the explicit statement of planning suicide, combined with the profound hopelessness and despair, indicates a desire for life to end, even if there's an internal conflict or resignation (""whether i want to or not"").
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The phrase ""whether i want to or not"" is ambiguous, but it follows a declarative ""i plan to kill myself,"" suggesting a decision or firm intention rather than just an unwanted thought. The overall context supports a genuine desire for an end to suffering.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - The post states a future intention/plan in terms of timing (""at 21""), but it lacks the specific *how* (method) or *what is being done now* (preparations) to qualify for 'Behavior' based on the given definition which requires ""a specific method, or preparations being taken.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""i plan to kill myself at 21"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is a clear, explicit personal expression of suicidal intent (""i plan to kill myself"").
    - **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past or very recent initiated action is described.
    - **Behavior:** The post explicitly states a plan to ""kill myself at 21."" While this is a *plan* in terms of *timing*, the definition of 'Behavior' specifically requires mention of ""a specific method, or preparations being taken"" (e.g., ""overdosing on X pills,"" ""jump from Y,"" ""have a gun,"" ""writing my suicide note""). Since no specific method or preparation is mentioned, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'"" reinforces this.
    - **Ideation:** The post contains ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""i plan to kill myself,"" ""no hope,"" ""this is hell""). It explicitly states a future intention/plan, but crucially, it does so ""without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out"" in terms of the *how*. The stated timing of the plan (""at 21"") is a strong indicator of suicidal intent, placing it firmly in Ideation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon"". There are no mentions of specific methods or means.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't like anything about myself,"" ""hate my job and my family,"" ""don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence,"" ""Nobody is getting anything out of this,"" ""sick and tried of crying myself to sleep every night."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and feeling like a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** None mentioned. Deactivating social media and isolation are noted, but these are not direct preparations for a suicidal act.
    *   **References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The post explicitly negates immediate action with ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case.""
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer states ""I want to die,"" which is a clear desire to die. However, they immediately qualify this by stating they will not act on it ""any time soon"" and are seeking ways to ""go about existing without feeling anything,"" indicating a desire to cope with the pain of existence rather than immediately end it. The core desire to die is present, but the intent to act is deferred.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I want to die"" and ""I am not going to kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"" and ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer explicitly states ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon."" While the desire to die is present, the *intent to act* is explicitly negated for the immediate future. This is a crucial nuance. The desire to die is present, but the immediate action is ruled out.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a *negated* immediate future intention.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""I want to die"") and profound despair (""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence,"" ""sick and tried of crying myself to sleep every night""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator', which is for general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   Despite the explicit statement ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon,"" the underlying desire to die is still present. This temporal qualification means there is no *immediate* plan or intent to act, preventing it from being 'Behavior'. The request ""Can someone tell me how to go about existing without feeling anything?"" also suggests a search for coping mechanisms for the pain of existence, rather than an immediate intent to end life.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the most fitting category is 'Ideation' because it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but lacks a specific plan or immediate intent to act. The ""not any time soon"" is a qualifier on the *action*, not a negation of the underlying *ideation*.

I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""I feel like the only way out is suicide."" It also mentions a specific method: ""I've considered hanging."" The phrase ""I should just make my escape"" also implies a desire to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with indicators of distress: ""bothers me,"" ""hate,"" ""cry very easily,"" ""feel so empty,"" ""feel like things are just crushing,"" ""overwhelming,"" ""really scared,"" ""awkward and very sensitive."" It expresses hopelessness about work, money, and social connections, and a sense of being stuck.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method, ""hanging,"" is mentioned. However, it's qualified by ""I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it."" There are no mentions of active preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes).
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've considered hanging"" refers to a past or ongoing thought process, but it explicitly states the *lack of action* or ""guts to do it.""
    *   **Imminence:** No immediate temporal markers for action are present.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear stated desire to die or end suffering via suicide (""only way out is suicide,"" ""make my escape""). However, this desire is immediately tempered by the stated inability to act on it (""don't really have the guts to do it,"" ""can't seem to go through with it"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I feel like the only way out is suicide,"" ""I should just make my escape"").
    *   While the writer states they ""don't have the guts"" or ""can't seem to go through with it,"" this is a statement about their *ability to act*, not a negation of the *desire* for suicide or the presence of suicidal thoughts. The desire and thoughts are clearly present.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method (""hanging"") is mentioned. However, the crucial qualifier ""but I can't seem to go through with it"" indicates that this is a *consideration* or a *thought* about a method, not a *plan* to use it or *preparations* being taken. The post explicitly states the author's current inability to execute this method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and thoughts. ""I've considered hanging"" refers to a past or ongoing thought, but explicitly states that no action was taken or can be taken.
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action was initiated or described as having been initiated. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond 'Indicator' because it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""only way out is suicide,"" ""make my escape"").
    *   The post mentions a specific method (""hanging""). This is a key element that can push a post towards 'Behavior'. However, the critical phrase ""but I can't seem to go through with it"" and ""I don't really have the guts to do it"" indicates that this method is something the author has *considered* but is currently *unable or unwilling to act upon*. It is a thought about a method, not a concrete plan or preparation. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a plan, method, *or preparations being taken*. While a method is mentioned, it's explicitly negated as actionable by the author. This makes it a very strong form of ideation, where a method has been conceptualized, but without the intent or ability to act on it. Given the explicit negation of action, it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior' which implies a more active or imminent intent related to the method. It's deep ideation with a conceptualized method, but no active planning or preparation.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' because it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and desire, and while a method is considered, there's no active plan, preparation, or ability to execute it.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i'm going to kill myself"", ""suicidal notes"".
    - Emotional indicators: Clear despair and hopelessness, ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"".
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""i already got my suicidal notes ready"" is a clear preparation. ""just a matter of when and how"" implies future planning.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"" indicates a timeframe, and ""decided on it"" suggests a firm intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear and explicit desire to die and commit suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""i'm going to kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i've decided on it"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states they *have* decided to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method/tool/location is mentioned, but ""just a matter of when and how"" indicates future planning.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""i already got my suicidal notes ready."" This is a concrete sign of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current decision and future intention/action.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes preparation for a future action, not an initiated attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent (""i'm going to kill myself and i've decided on it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post also explicitly mentions a preparation: ""i already got my suicidal notes ready."" This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' and into 'Behavior' because a concrete step towards carrying out the intent has been taken.
    - It does not describe an initiated, potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the presence of both explicit suicidal intent and a specific preparation (suicidal notes) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The desire is to ""be someone else,"" which is distinct from wanting to die. While the distress is high, the intent is not explicitly suicidal.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.
    *   If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. This applies here.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and past attempts to change appearance. No suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and severe self-loathing related to body image.
    *   However, it **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.** The desire to ""be someone else"" indicates a wish to escape their current self, but not explicitly to end their life.
    *   There are no mentions of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
    *   Therefore, it best fits the 'Indicator' category, as it expresses significant distress without explicit suicidal intent.

In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, ""kill themselves,"" ""hurt themselves.""
    - Emotional indicators: None from the author. The author is expressing an opinion about *others*.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None from the author.
    - References to past actions: None from the author.
    - Imminence: None from the author.
    - Writer's stated desire: The author is *not* expressing a desire to die or suicidal thoughts for themselves. They are speculating about the motivations of others who post suicidal content.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill themselves,"" but in reference to *other people*, not the author.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, not from the author.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? N/A, as the thoughts are not the author's.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, not for the author.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for the author.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It discusses the phenomenon of *other people* posting about suicide, and the author's opinion on it. It does not describe any personal action or intention from the author.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, not from the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post does not contain any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, or past attempts by the author.
    - The author is discussing the topic of suicide abstractly by commenting on the behavior of others who post about it.
    - The definition of 'Indicator' includes ""discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" This post fits that description perfectly. It's a meta-commentary on suicide posts, not a personal expression of risk.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""No point in existing,"" ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""Im so tired of being alive,"" ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""hurts the people that you love,"" ""tired,"" ""sad,"" ""never going to happen"" (hopelessness), ""don't mean to hurt anyone"" (burden).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for current intent.
    - References to past actions: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed."" This is a key element.
    - Imminence: No specific imminence for current intent, but the past attempts are significant.
    - Stated desire: Clear desire to die/end life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""No point in existing,"" ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""Im so tired of being alive.""

    - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for current intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        - Current intention: ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself,"" ""Im so tired of being alive.""
        - Past event: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed."" This describes a concrete, self-initiated action that was potentially lethal, even though it failed.

    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""the past two times ive tried ive failed"" directly indicates initiated suicidal actions in the past.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses current suicidal ideation.
    - However, it also explicitly states that the author has ""tried"" to kill themselves two times in the past and ""failed."" This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt' because it describes past, specific, self-initiated actions that were potentially lethal.
    - The rule states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The past action is clearly described as ""tried"" and ""failed,"" indicating concrete attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""killing myself"" is explicitly used. The phrase ""I don't want to be alive"" clearly indicates a desire for death.
    - Emotional indicators: The user expresses a strong disregard for external judgment (""couldn't care less"") and dismisses arguments against suicide (""blah blah""), indicating a firm, despairing stance.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. There is no indication of how, where, or with what the user intends to act.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""), but the desire is current.
    - Asses the writer's stated desire: There is a genuine wish to die/not be alive, explicitly stated (""killing myself,"" ""I don't want to be alive"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself.""

    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is dismissing reasons *not* to act, reinforcing the desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, explicit personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die (""killing myself,"" ""I don't want to be alive"").
    - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, tool, location, or preparation.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past or very recent initiated action is described.
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without any specific plan or preparation, which aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""My desire to kill myself has not."" ""Killing myself is painful."" ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months."" ""getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape"".
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""what reason is there to live""), despair (""literally nothing,"" ""shit just gets more fucked up,"" ""Why bother?""), anhedonia (""don't care anymore"").
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""overdose"" is mentioned as a method for past attempts. ""getting hit by an incoming train"" is mentioned as a current consideration for escape, implying a method.
    - References to past actions: ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months."" This is a clear description of initiated, potentially lethal actions.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The desire to kill self is current (""has not"" died down). The desire to ""get out"" and choose ""getting hit by an incoming train"" is current (""at this point"").
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die/not be alive (""My desire to kill myself has not,"" ""what reason is there to live,"" ""I just want out"").

    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""what reason is there to live,"" ""I just want out,"" ""I'd honestly choose that at this point.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is affirmed and considered.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""overdose"" is explicitly mentioned as a method for past attempts. ""Getting hit by an incoming train"" is mentioned as a current, preferred means of escape.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations for a *future* act, but the past actions involved a method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        - Past event: ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months."" This describes concrete, initiated, potentially lethal actions.
        - Current/future intention: ""My desire to kill myself has not."" ""I just want out... I'd honestly choose that at this point."" (This indicates current ideation and consideration of future methods).
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""I've attempted an overdose"" fits this criterion directly.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains strong current suicidal ideation and consideration of future methods, which could point to 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'.
    - However, the most definitive element is the explicit mention of *past, initiated, potentially lethal actions*: ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months.""
    - The definition of 'Attempt' clearly states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" This perfectly matches the description of the overdose attempts.
    - The IMPORTANT RULE states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" This rule applies here.

Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most accurate classification.

Please I'm so fucking scared.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No direct mentions. The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" is about the necessity of HRT for their well-being and identity, not a statement of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""very worried,"" ""fucking horrified,"" ""keep crying,"" ""having panic attacks,"" ""too much,"" ""going insane,"" ""so fucking scared."" These indicate extreme distress, anxiety, fear, and feeling overwhelmed.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide/self-harm.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not applicable as no suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer is expressing extreme distress, fear, and feeling overwhelmed by perceived health issues and parental judgment. There is no stated desire to die or not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The distress is related to health fears and family dynamics, not a wish to end their life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current intense distress and worries about future consequences (health, parental reaction).
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses severe distress, fear, panic, and feeling overwhelmed.
    - However, it *lacks* any explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, or any mention of a plan, method, or past attempt. The core of the post is about anxiety over a health issue and family dynamics, not suicidal ideation.
    - Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and hopelessness (""too much,"" ""going insane"") but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""Now it's time to end it"" strongly implies ending life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""NO hope left,"" ""did NOTHING"" (referring to treatments), despair, feeling unheard/unhelped, financial distress (""don't even eat"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for the *current* intention.
    - References to past actions: ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" This explicitly refers to multiple past initiated actions. The phrasing ""I tried"" implies a concrete, potentially lethal action was initiated.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""Now it's time to end it"" indicates a current, immediate intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear desire to end their life, supported by past actions and current hopelessness.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end it"" is a clear euphemism for ending one's life.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Now it's time to end it.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method or location is mentioned for the *current* intention.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. However, the presence of past ""tried"" actions is crucial.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. It describes multiple past ""tried"" actions (""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."") and a current intention (""Now it's time to end it."").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, the repeated phrase ""I tried"" strongly indicates past initiated, concrete actions to end their life. This fits the definition of an 'Attempt'.
    - If a past action is described, was it a concrete suicidal act or just thinking about one? The phrasing ""I tried"" implies concrete actions, not just thoughts or plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear current suicidal ideation (""Now it's time to end it"").
    - However, the most significant element is the explicit mention of multiple past initiated actions: ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt', which describes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The rule states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The past actions are clearly described as ""tried"" multiple times.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states, ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Society doesn't like me,"" ""People bully me,"" ""don't feel comfortable,"" ""something is wrong with me,"" ""nothing fills the hole in my heart,"" ""feel lonely,"" ""feel like I am only watching other living human beings,"" ""feel like I am on the moon,"" ""unconnected with this world,"" ""feel like a creature."" These indicate profound distress, loneliness, anhedonia, and feelings of being an outcast.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""In the pas I tried to hide this with saying 'I am misanthrope'"" refers to a past coping mechanism for social isolation, not a past suicidal action.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" indicates ongoing, daily thoughts. ""Everyday I am trying to survive"" suggests a struggle against these thoughts, but the primary statement is about the presence of the thoughts themselves.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrase ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" is a clear personal expression of suicidal thoughts. While ""Everyday I am trying to survive"" implies a struggle, it does not explicitly negate the desire or state that these thoughts are unwanted/intrusive in a way that would classify it as 'Indicator'. The thoughts are clearly present for the author.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""thinking about suicide everyday.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the daily thoughts of suicide in the context of deep despair strongly imply a desire or a significant struggle with such a desire. The statement ""Everyday I am trying to survive"" indicates a battle, but the core is the presence of the suicidal thoughts themselves.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, while they are ""trying to survive,"" this doesn't negate the personal presence of the thoughts or explicitly state they don't want to act on them. It's a struggle with the thoughts, not a rejection of them as unwanted intrusions.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current, ongoing thoughts (""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit, personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category as it describes explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan or past action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm not scared to die."" ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" ""Good luck to the rest of you"" (implies farewell). ""I've given up in life.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""What's the use,"" ""given up in life,"" ""for me it doesn't [get better]""), despair, anhedonia (implied by social isolation, drinking/smoking, weight gain, lack of intimacy).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" This explicitly states a plan, a note (preparation), and a date (imminence).
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    - Imminence: ""early April"" - specific date, relatively soon.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""I'm not scared to die,"" ""I've given up in life,"" combined with the plan). The initial reason for living (""so I wouldn't torment my family"") seems to have been overcome, as the post now states a plan.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""I'm not scared to die"" and ""I have a plan, note and date"" strongly imply a clear desire to die by one's own hand.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm not scared to die"" combined with the explicit mention of a ""plan, note and date"" and the farewell ""Good luck to the rest of you"" clearly indicates a desire to die and carry out an act.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post indicates acceptance and preparation to act on these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? A ""plan"" is explicitly mentioned, along with a ""note"" (preparation) and a ""date"" (imminence). While the *specifics* of the method aren't detailed, the presence of ""a plan"" and ""note"" is sufficient.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""note"" and ""date"" are explicit preparations. ""Good luck to the rest of you"" also serves as a farewell.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention with a specific future date (""early April"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes a *future* plan, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I'm not scared to die,"" ""I've given up in life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly states ""I have a plan, note and date."" This presence of a plan and preparations (note, date, farewell) moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    - The post describes a future intention and preparations, not a past initiated action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The combination of explicit suicidal intent and the mention of a plan and preparations fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care. If it happens it happens. My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself."" Mentions self-harm: ""how many cuts I have all over myself."" Expresses a fatalistic view of dying: ""end up dead in a gutter one day."" Ends with ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""too much recently,"" ""anger is worse than ever,"" ""rabid dog,"" ""constantly on edge,"" ""ready to explode,"" ""no family anyway so no one would care or miss me,"" ""I don't care."" (High distress, hopelessness, feeling like a burden, agitation, anhedonia).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post presents a dilemma: ""either I walk into an ER... or I actually do go through with it and kill myself."" The first option is a plan for seeking help. The second option, ""actually do go through with it and kill myself,"" expresses intent but *lacks a specific method or detailed plan* for suicide itself. The phrase ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye"" could be seen as a preparation (saying goodbye), but it's not tied to a specific method or action.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""how many cuts I have all over myself"" indicates past/ongoing self-harm, but not a past *suicide attempt* as defined (i.e., an initiated, potentially lethal action with suicidal intent).
    *   **Imminence:** ""This will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" strongly suggests imminence. However, the author also states, ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet,"" which indicates the decision is not yet final, though the intent is clearly present.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to die expressed as a serious alternative: ""or I actually do go through with it and kill myself.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive as a personal option (""or I actually do go through with it and kill myself"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them; rather, they are debating acting on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned for the suicidal act itself. The plan mentioned is for seeking help (""going to a hospital and checking myself in"") or the alternative of ""go through with it and kill myself"" without specifying *how*.
    *   The ""last post ever. Goodbye"" could be a general sign of preparation, but it's not linked to a specific, concrete suicidal plan or method. It's more of a general farewell.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current distress, past self-harm (""cuts""), and a future intention/dilemma (seeking help vs. acting on suicidal intent).
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action by the author that was initiated in the past or very recently is described. The ""cuts"" are self-harm, not a described suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""kill myself"" is presented as a personal option). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   While there is strong intent and a sense of imminence (""last post ever. Goodbye""), there is no *specific plan, method, or concrete preparation* for the suicidal act itself. The choice is between seeking help or an undefined ""go through with it and kill myself."" Without a described method (e.g., ""I'm going to overdose,"" ""I have a gun""), it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   No past or very recent initiated potentially lethal action is described, so it's not 'Attempt'.

Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' due to explicit personal suicidal intent and desire to die, but without a specific plan/method.

26,"Im so tired i can't kill myself. I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there, i just can't commit to it.

I told someone that im suicidal, they know that if i hang out with them really helps me, but they don't do anything about, they insist that they care but i dont believe it, maybe its my brain playing with me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""can't kill myself,"" ""suicidal,"" ""good clif"" (implied method/location for jumping).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Im so tired,"" ""can't commit to it,"" ""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point,"" ""i don't believe it,"" ""maybe its my brain playing with me."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, anhedonia, and feelings of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there."" This is a specific location identified as a potential means to an end, and its feasibility is considered.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I told someone that im suicidal"" - this is a past disclosure of thoughts, not a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The phrase ""i just can't commit to it"" suggests a current lack of resolve to act *immediately*, but the underlying desire and knowledge of a method/location are present.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** While ""i can't kill myself"" might initially sound like a negation, the context of knowing a ""good clif"" and being ""so tired"" and feeling ""no me at this point"" strongly implies a desire to die, hindered by an inability to commit to the action, rather than a lack of desire itself. The overall tone is one of profound suicidal ideation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself"" and ""suicidal.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the context of ""Im so tired i can't kill myself"" combined with ""there's no me at this point"" and the contemplation of a specific method/location indicates a clear desire, even if the commitment to act is currently lacking.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the ""can't commit to it"" refers to the *action*, not a rejection of the *desire* or *thoughts*. The struggle is with the execution, not the underlying wish.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""a good clif"" is a specific location identified for a potential suicidal act (jumping). The distance and feasibility (""its possible to get there"") are also considered.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Identifying a specific location and assessing its feasibility (""possible to get there"") is a form of planning, even if not fully executed preparation like acquiring a tool or writing a note.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current struggle and contemplation of a future action.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. It describes contemplation and a lack of commitment to a *future* action, not a past initiated attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent (""kill myself,"" ""suicidal,"" ""no me at this point""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by identifying a specific method/location (""a good clif"") and considering its feasibility (""its possible to get there""). This constitutes a planning element, even if the author states they ""can't commit to it"" currently. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" Identifying a specific cliff for this purpose fits this criterion.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with the identification of a specific method/location (a cliff) for a potential suicidal act classifies this as 'Behavior'.

    - References to past actions: No past suicidal or self-harm actions.
    - Imminence: No specific temporal markers for an action.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrases ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born"" clearly express a personal desire for an end to their suffering and existence. This is a strong indicator of suicidal ideation, even without the word ""suicide.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress and explicitly states a desire for things to ""stop"" and a wish to ""never be born,"" which are strong expressions of not wanting to be alive. This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There are no mentions of a plan, method, or preparations, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"" is a direct mention of suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Depressed,"" ""shit show,"" ""fake ass friends,"" ""shitty family,"" ""fuck you"" indicate strong negative emotions, despair, anger, and a sense of being a burden/resentment.

    - References to past actions: No past actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""I can't wait to"" suggests a desire for it to happen, but doesn't specify an immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") in the context of an action. It's more of a general desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, explicit wish to ""kill myself.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""end it all"", ""goodbye everybody"". These are clear expressions of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""no one really understands"", ""doubt anyone will care"" indicate hopelessness and isolation.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" strongly implies a specific method has been chosen, even if not detailed. ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks"" indicates a timeline. ""I'm not gonna tell anyone either"" is a specific preparation/decision. ""So goodbye everybody"" is a farewell, a clear sign of preparation.
    - References to past actions: ""all ready tried that before and no one really understands"" refers to past attempts to communicate distress, not a past suicide attempt.
    - Imminence: ""a few weeks"" indicates a future intention, not immediate, but still a definite plan.
    - Stated desire: ""I'm ready. I'm finally ready to just end it all"" shows a clear and personal desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""end it all"" and ""goodbye everybody"" in this context clearly express a desire to die and suicidal intent. The writer explicitly states they are ""ready"" to ""end it all.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" implies a specific method is decided.
    - Yes, ""I'm not gonna tell anyone either"" and ""So goodbye everybody"" are explicit preparations.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a future intention (""I'm gonna wait a few weeks"").
    - It does not describe a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action. The past mention refers to communication, not an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's a clear, personal desire to die and explicit suicidal intent.
    - It's not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond just thoughts/desire; it includes the implication of a decided method (""I already know how I'm gonna do it"") and clear preparations (""I'm not gonna tell anyone"", ""goodbye everybody"").
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action is described. The post is about future intent and current preparations.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal desire (""ready to end it all"") combined with the strong implication of a decided method and clear preparations (""know how I'm gonna do it"", ""not gonna tell anyone"", ""goodbye everybody"") fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""kill my self,"" ""hold the blade.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""burden,"" ""disappointment,"" ""hate me,"" ""screws up everyone's lives,"" ""nothing."" (Hopelessness, self-loathing, feeling like a burden).
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""hold the blade"" is a specific tool.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it."" This describes an action (holding the blade with suicidal intent) that was initiated but not completed.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The use of present tense (""I hold the blade"") suggests a current or very recent struggle.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"" and the frustration of ""I can't even fucking kill my self"" indicate a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""kill my self"" is explicit.
    - Yes, ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"" expresses a clear desire to die.
    - The writer expresses frustration at *not* being able to act, implying a desire to act, not a desire to *not* have the thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method/tool (""blade"") is mentioned.
    - Yes, ""I hold the blade"" indicates preparation or an immediate, initiated action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/very recent initiated action: ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it.""
    - This describes a specific, potentially lethal action (holding a blade with intent to self-harm/suicide) that was initiated but stopped/failed by the author (""can't fucking do it""). This aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' which includes actions ""even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The act of holding the blade with the stated intent to ""kill myself"" is a concrete, initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and mentions a specific method, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The mention of a specific method (""blade"") and the description of an *initiated action* (""I hold the blade"") goes beyond mere 'Ideation' (thoughts/desire without plan) and 'Behavior' (plan/method/preparation for a future act).
    - The phrase ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" precisely fits the 'Attempt' definition because it describes a self-initiated action that was potentially lethal, even though it was not completed. The act of *holding the blade with suicidal intent* is the initiated action.
    - Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""how about i die then"" - a direct question implying suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""depressed"", ""stripping yourself of individuality"", ""playing within their comfort zone"", ""Well shit"", ""People love plastic, and people love plastic people"" - indicates deep despair, hopelessness, feeling unaccepted, and a sense of being a burden or not fitting in.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The phrase ""how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"" is a rhetorical question expressing a current thought or consideration, not a past action or a concrete immediate plan.
    - Stated desire: The phrasing ""how about i die then"" clearly expresses a personal desire to die, presented as a reaction to perceived family attitudes. It is not stated as an unwanted thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases, but ""how about i die then"" is a very clear and direct expression of a desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""how about i die then"" unequivocally expresses this desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the phrasing suggests a personal consideration/desire, not an unwanted thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there is a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, this points towards 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current thought/intention (""how about i die then"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes a thought or desire, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""how about i die then"").
    - It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out suicide.
    - It does not describe a past initiated suicidal action.
    - It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it explicitly states a desire to die.
    - It lacks a plan/method/preparation, distinguishing it from 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe an initiated action, distinguishing it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""no hope,"" ""All is lost,"" ""pointless,"" ""meaningless,"" ""waste of energy.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned. No specific preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The ""daily reminder"" on the wallpaper reinforces intent but is not a preparation for an *act*.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""At least I DID try"" is too vague to indicate a past *suicidal action*. It seems to refer to trying in life generally.
    *   **Imminence:** ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life."" ""When it will happen I am unsure, but I do know that I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)."" This expresses a strong, certain future intent, but lacks immediate specific timing or a concrete plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die and take own life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and ""taking my own life.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and states it is ""100% confirmed.""
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""jump,"" ""gun"") is mentioned.
    *   No specific tools, substances, or locations are mentioned.
    *   No concrete signs of preparation (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills,"" ""saying goodbye"") are mentioned. The wallpaper is a reminder of intent, not a physical preparation for an act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a future intention (""will happen,"" ""will be taking my own life,"" ""will not live to see my 40th birthday"").
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. ""At least I DID try"" is not a description of a suicidal act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, explicit, personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die (""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life"").
    *   It's not 'Behavior' because, despite the strong certainty of intent, there is *no mention* of a specific plan, method, or concrete preparation (e.g., specific means, location, or actions like writing a note or giving things away). The wallpaper is a psychological reinforcement, not a physical preparation for an act.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past or very recent *initiated* suicidal action.

    Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparations.

    - References to past actions: ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down."" This describes a past *opportunity* and a decision *not* to act, rather than an initiated attempt.
    - Imminence: ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"" indicates a persistent, current desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die/kill oneself.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").
    - The writer expresses regret for *not* acting on suicidal thoughts in the past, indicating a desire to act rather than distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned for a *current* or *future* suicidal act. The ""perfect opportunity"" refers to a past situation where no action was taken.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past *opportunity* where the writer *did not* act (""I shouldn't have talked myself down""). It also describes a current/ongoing desire (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").
    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. The text explicitly states the action was *not* taken (""I was a pussy,"" ""I shouldn't have talked myself down""). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for a *current* or *future* act, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - The past event described was an *opportunity* to act, but the writer explicitly states they *did not* act (""talked myself down""). This means no concrete, potentially lethal action was initiated, so it does not meet the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the clear desire to die and suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or initiated action, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""too weak,"" ""hurt me severely,"" ""embarrassing myself,"" ""showing how weak I am,"" ""pathetic,"" ""continue to be used."" These indicate significant emotional distress, low self-esteem, and feelings of helplessness in a difficult interpersonal situation.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: The post describes past attempts to deal with the friends (""I tried at first,"" ""I told him last week""), but these are not related to suicide.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire for ""things to be normal"" and ""to have someone to be friends with,"" and for the friend to ""understand how shitty he's being."" There is no stated desire to die or not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The distress is related to interpersonal conflict and feelings of weakness/being used, not a desire to end life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes ongoing relational issues and the author's feelings about them.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly indicates general distress, sadness, and feelings of hopelessness regarding a specific social situation. However, it completely lacks any mention of suicide, a desire to die, or any suicidal intent. The emotional indicators point to significant emotional pain and low self-worth, but not to suicidal ideation or behavior.
    - Based on the definitions:
        - 'Indicator' fits because it describes ""general distress, sadness, hopelessness... but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.""
        - 'Ideation' is incorrect as there are no explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or desire to not be alive.
        - 'Behavior' is incorrect as there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
        - 'Attempt' is incorrect as no past or recent potentially lethal action is described.
    - Therefore, the post falls under 'Indicator' due to the presence of distress without any suicidal content.

35,"Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?. Today's my birthday. I feel hollow. Everyone expects happiness and joy. I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post states ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working,"" explicitly stating it's metaphorical. However, it also states ""I just want to not exist,"" which is a clear expression of a desire for non-existence.
    - Emotional indicators: ""hollow,"" ""nothing but sadness,"" ""hate this,"" ""hurts so bad,"" ""suffer through this painful middle ground,"" ""God I fucking hate myself."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, anhedonia, and self-loathing.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None identified. No mention of tools, locations, substances, or preparatory actions.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence: No specific temporal markers for any suicidal intent (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer clearly states ""I just want to not exist,"" indicating a genuine desire to not be alive. They are not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; they are expressing a personal wish.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, the ""kill myself"" is explicitly metaphorical.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to not exist"" is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to ""not exist"" is presented as a personal longing.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire (""I just want to not exist"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress and profound sadness, but it goes beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit personal desire ""I just want to not exist."" This indicates a clear desire to not be alive.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""put a bullet right through it"" is a specific method (gun/bullet to the head).
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""I can't take it anymore"" suggests current distress. No specific time frame like ""tonight.""
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a very clear and strong desire to die (""I just want to die,"" ""I hate being alive,"" ""I want to end it""). The phrase ""someone please murder me becasue i dont have the balls to take my own life"" indicates a desire for death but a personal struggle with self-initiation, it does not negate the desire to die. The thought of ""put a bullet right through it"" is a direct suicidal thought with a method.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes (""I just want to end it,"" ""put a bullet right through it,"" ""take my own life,"" ""I just want to die"").
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, very clearly and repeatedly.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to die is explicit and strong. The statement about ""not having the balls"" refers to the courage to act, not a lack of desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""put a bullet right through it"" is a specific method (gun/bullet).
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations mentioned.
    - The presence of a specific method (""bullet"") moves this beyond pure ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""I just want to end it,"" ""I just want to put a bullet..."").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, no past initiated action is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The post includes a specific method (""put a bullet right through it""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation' and into 'Behavior', as a method is mentioned.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The phrase ""someone please murder me becasue i dont have the balls to take my own life"" indicates a struggle with self-initiation, but it does not negate the presence of the suicidal thought *with a method* (""put a bullet right through it""). The definition of Behavior includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" The mention of ""a bullet"" is a specific method.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""suicide watch"" (indicates external concern), ""wasn't made for life,"" ""take a bunch of pills"" (specific method), ""don't want to die in pain,"" ""it would be better if i was dead,"" ""wish i could just fucking end it.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared,"" ""sad,"" ""too much,"" ""too painful,"" ""loathe myself,"" hopelessness (""no progress,"" ""accomplished nothing,"" ""contribute nothing"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep"" is a specific method and a situational plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""on suicide watch"" indicates past concern from others, but not a past *initiated* suicidal action by the author. ""getting by for almost twenty years"" refers to general life struggle, not a past attempt.
    *   **Imminence:** The phrase ""could take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep"" suggests a potential current/future action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die (""it would be better if i was dead,"" ""wish i could just fucking end it""). The fear (""too scared,"" ""don't want to die in pain,"" ""don't want to make my mother sad"") represents internal conflict, but the underlying desire to end life is explicitly stated.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly expresses a clear desire to die (""it would be better if i was dead,"" ""wish i could just fucking end it""). It also mentions ""suicide watch.""
    *   No, the writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. The hesitation is about the *consequences* (pain, mother's sadness), not a negation of the desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""take a bunch of pills."" The timing (""while everyones asleep"") adds a situational element to the plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current/future intention (""I could take a bunch of pills..."").
    *   It does *not* describe a past initiated, potentially lethal action. The ""suicide watch"" refers to external monitoring, not an action taken by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal ideation and a desire to die, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, it mentions a specific method (""take a bunch of pills"") and a situational plan (""while everyones asleep""). This presence of a specific method/plan moves it beyond 'Ideation' and into 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past *initiated* action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the combination of explicit suicidal desire and a specific method/plan clearly fits the 'Behavior' category.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>

    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Not currently for the author, as they state they are in a ""good place now."" However, the description of the past attempt implies a past desire.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, the author states they haven't had ideation in months and are in a good place.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event for the author: ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" and ""I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets.""
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, the phrases ""very serious attempt... which almost succeeded"" and ""I faltered in my plan"" clearly indicate an *initiated action* by the author in the past, even if it was not completed or failed.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The classification is for the *author's* suicide risk.
    *   While the author states they are not currently suicidal, the post *explicitly describes a past, initiated, potentially lethal action* by the author (""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded"").
    *   This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" is a clear euphemism for suicidal thoughts.
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""worry,"" ""tired of always being afraid and upset,"" ""tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation,"" ""live every moment in shame."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" and ""it's tempting a lot of the time"" indicate ongoing, current thoughts and a strong pull towards acting on them.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer states ""it's tempting a lot of the time"" in reference to the suicidal thoughts. This indicates a personal, current desire or strong pull towards suicide. They are not explicitly stating they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them; rather, they are acknowledging the temptation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, through the euphemism ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts,"" which is a clear personal expression of suicidal ideation.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""it's tempting a lot of the time"" in the context of suicidal thoughts implies a desire or strong pull towards ending their life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, they state the thoughts are ""tempting,"" which indicates a desire or pull towards them, not a negation.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:

    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts (""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"") and a strong pull/desire towards them (""it's tempting a lot of the time""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator' because there is a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal intent/desire.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This means it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal act. This means it does not fit 'Attempt'.

And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me.

    - Emotional indicators: ""I hate myself so much,"" ""terrible,"" ""awful,"" ""shouldn't exist,"" ""disgusting and pathetic,"" ""sad and stupid person,"" ""hate everything,"" ""humiliates me so deeply,"" ""fucked in the head,"" ""want to crawl out of my skin."" (Strong indicators of self-loathing, hopelessness, despair).
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:
        - Method/Location: ""jump in front of a train"" is explicitly mentioned as a desired method.
        - Preparations: ""don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" indicates consideration of preparations, even if it's an obstacle. This shows a thought process related to the logistics of suicide.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""It's looking pretty good"" (referring to going through with it), despite the stated cowardice. The desire is strong and current.
    - Writer's stated desire: A very clear and explicit wish to die and commit suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" multiple times and expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to kill myself so badly,"" ""I hate being alive"").
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they express a strong desire to act on them and even ask for encouragement (""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method and location are mentioned: ""jump in front of a train.""
    - Yes, there are signs of preparation being considered (or obstacles to preparation): ""don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)."" This indicates the person is thinking about the practicalities of ending their life.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current and future intentions. It does not describe a past event where a specific, potentially lethal action was initiated. The desire to jump in front of a train is a wish for a future action, not a description of a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere ideation by clearly mentioning a specific method (""jump in front of a train"") and considering the practicalities/preparations (""end of life stuff""). This moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

Based on the explicit desire to die, the clear mention of a specific method, and the consideration of preparations, the post fits the 'Behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to kill myself"", ""everyone would be better off with me dead"".
    - Emotional indicators: Extreme distress, self-loathing (""fuck me"" repeated), feelings of worthlessness (""im useless""), physical distress (""i cant breathe"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated with a timeframe, but the intensity of distress suggests current thoughts.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear and explicit desire to die is expressed (""I want to kill myself"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I want to kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to kill myself,"" ""everyone would be better off with me dead.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly stated.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention/desire.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (""I want to kill myself"", ""everyone would be better off with me dead"").
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for carrying out suicide.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - Based on the definitions:
        - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die.
        - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
        - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past or very recent initiated action is described.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the correct category as it aligns with explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, without a specific plan, method, or preparations.

42,"confinement mental break down. i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it. i am growing more depressed and feeling more alone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method of self-harm often associated with suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" ""feeling more alone"" indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method. However, the post explicitly states ""but i didnt do it,"" indicating no action was taken or preparation was made.
    *   References to past actions: ""i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it."" This describes a past thought, not an initiated action.
    *   Imminence: ""today"" indicates the thoughts were very recent.
    *   Writer's stated desire: The post describes strong suicidal thoughts (""thought about slitting my wrists"") in a context of increasing despair, implying a desire to escape suffering, which is characteristic of suicidal intent. The ""but i didnt do it"" refers to the *action*, not the presence or desire of the thought itself.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not directly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" thinking about a specific lethal method like ""slitting my wrists"" in a context of ""mental break down"" and ""growing more depressed"" strongly implies a desire to end suffering or not be alive. This is a clear personal expression of suicidal thought.
    *   Does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The ""but i didnt do it"" refers to the *action*, not a negation of the *thought* or the underlying desire. The thought itself is presented as something that occurred.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method mentioned? Yes, ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, the post explicitly states ""but i didnt do it,"" meaning no preparation or action was taken.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' requires a mention of a *plan* or *preparations being taken*. Merely *thinking* about a method, without any indication of a current plan or action, falls under 'Ideation'. The phrase ""I thought about X but didn't do it"" describes a strong suicidal thought, not a current plan or preparation for action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past thought (""thought about... today"").
    *   It explicitly states that no action was initiated (""but i didnt do it""). This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide. ""I thought about slitting my wrists"" is a clear, specific, personal expression of suicidal ideation, involving a method, even if not acted upon. This is too specific for 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** While a method (""slitting my wrists"") is mentioned, it's presented as a *thought* that was *not acted upon* (""but i didnt do it""). The definition of 'Behavior' requires a *plan* or *preparations being taken*. This post describes a past suicidal thought involving a method, but not a current plan or active preparation. Therefore, it fits 'Ideation' better.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No action was initiated, so it is not an 'Attempt'.

    The post clearly articulates a specific suicidal thought, but explicitly states that no action was taken, and does not indicate a current plan or preparation for future action. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>

    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""suicide notes,"" ""leaving soon,"" ""My minds made up,"" ""goodbye letters.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Expresses love for loved ones, but also a firm, decided intent.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** The act of writing ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters"" is a direct preparation for a suicidal act. The phrase ""leaving soon"" indicates imminence.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""leaving soon.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, stated desire to die and end their life (""I'm leaving soon,"" ""My minds made up,"" ""Don't say please don't go. Stay.""). The request for help with ""goodbye letters"" and ""suicide notes"" confirms this intent and preparation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide notes.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm leaving soon,"" ""My minds made up.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite; they are actively seeking help to facilitate the act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method, but the *preparation* of writing ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters"" is explicitly stated. This falls under preparations.

    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it's about preparing for an act, not describing a past initiated act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I'm leaving soon,"" ""My minds made up"") and explicitly mentions ""suicide notes."" This rules out 'Indicator'.

This fits the definition of 'Behavior' (explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions a plan, method, or preparations being taken).
    *   It does not describe a past initiated attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the presence of clear suicidal intent combined with explicit preparation (writing suicide notes) classifies this as 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon,"" ""8 yrs of constant attempts,"" ""didn't die last night,"" ""struggle with sh/suicidality.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""worst of this hell,"" ""fucking done,"" ""don't trust,"" ""trauma/ptsd,"" ""treated like shit."" High levels of despair, hopelessness, and distrust.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** A specific ""suicide date"" (Friday, May 14, 2021) is given, which constitutes a plan. ""save some flowers for me please?"" implies preparation for death/funeral.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" is a direct reference to multiple past suicidal actions. ""only reason I didn't die last night"" strongly implies a very recent, initiated action or a close call.
    *   **Imminence:** ""This Friday, May 14, 2021,"" ""before it (doubt ill make it that long),"" ""end thing v v soon."" High imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die (""enough is enough,"" ""I'm fucking done,"" ""end thing v v soon""). While there's a conditional desire to live if help were available, it's immediately negated by perceived impossibility, reinforcing the intent to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon.""
    *   Yes, clear desire to die.
    *   No, the desire to die is explicit and intended, not unwanted thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific date (""suicide date"") is a clear plan. ""save some flowers for me please?"" is a sign of preparation.
    *   No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned, but the date and farewell indicate a concrete plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Describes both past events (""8 yrs of constant attempts,"" ""didn't die last night"") and current/future intention (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon"").
    *   Crucially, it describes *specific, potentially lethal actions* that were initiated in the past: ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" directly refers to initiated suicidal actions. ""only reason I didn't die last night"" implies a very recent initiated action or a close call. The definition of 'Attempt' specifically covers ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation and a current plan/preparations, which would fit 'Behavior'.
    *   However, it *also* explicitly states ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" and implies a very recent initiated action (""only reason I didn't die last night""). The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The past actions are clearly described as ""attempts."" Therefore, 'Attempt' takes precedence.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""in my grave I lay,"" ""I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds,"" ""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Pointlessness,"" ""sick of,"" ""distresses me,"" ""pain caused to people I care about."" Strong feelings of despair, anhedonia, social alienation, and a desire for non-existence.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned. There is no ""how"" the writer will die by 35 or disappear.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I know I will die by 35"" is a future prediction/limit, not immediate. ""I want to disappear forever"" is a general desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire for non-existence (""disappear forever,"" ""missing pixel/puzzle piece"") and a stated certainty of death by a specific age (""I know I will die by 35""). This is a strong expression of a desire to not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds,"" and ""I know I will die by 35"" (as a self-imposed limit) clearly indicate a desire for an end to life or non-existence.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire for non-existence is presented as a personal wish.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current desire (""I want to disappear forever"") and a future self-prophecy/limit (""I know I will die by 35"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire for non-existence and a future end to life (""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35""). This goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it's a direct expression of a desire for an end to life, even without using the word ""suicide.""
    - However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., how the writer intends to die by 35 or disappear). This absence of a plan differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the most fitting category is 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive, without a plan.

While not explicit preparation like ""writing a note"", the active discussion and evaluation of specific methods and their potential effectiveness (""idk if... would even work"", ""might be enough to make me sick but not die"") constitutes a strong indication of planning or considering a specific course of action. The phrase ""taking these pills"" implies the pills are present or readily available for consideration.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention. The user is actively contemplating and evaluating methods.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I'm trying to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond just expressing a desire to die by explicitly discussing and evaluating specific methods (""hanging myself"", ""taking these pills""). This constitutes mentioning a ""plan, method, or preparation"" as per the 'Behavior' definition. The user isn't just thinking about dying, but actively considering *how* to do it and the potential success/failure of those methods.
    - Since specific methods are mentioned and evaluated, it fits the 'Behavior' category, not just 'Ideation'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

49,"thinking about admitting myself?. If I go to the psych ward and I'm not panicking or I don't have a specific plan for killing myself, will they take me seriously?. Everything is so much effort and I want to die, but I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up. I'm just so fucking depressed and numb and sick of everything. I don't want to go and have them tell me what I feel isn't real. I don't even really want to go at all, but I also know its safe and maybe I need that right now? I feel like I can't even think straight anymore, I don't know.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die,"" ""specific plan for killing myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Everything is so much effort,"" ""so fucking depressed and numb and sick of everything,"" ""scared of messing it up,"" ""can't even think straight anymore.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Explicitly states ""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself."" Also, ""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up.""
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The desire to die is present, but the immediate intent to act is negated by ""I'm probably not gonna do anything."" The user is contemplating seeking help (""admitting myself?"").
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear ""I want to die,"" which is a personal desire to die. The subsequent statement about not acting is due to fear, not a negation of the desire itself.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states they are ""scared of messing it up"" and ""probably not gonna do anything,"" which indicates a lack of immediate intent to act, but the desire to die is still very much present and personal. This is not a statement of ""I don't want these thoughts"" but rather ""I don't want to act on them right now due to fear."" The primary sentiment is still a desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The post explicitly states ""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself.""
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current feelings and contemplation of future action (seeking help).
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire (""I want to die"") and mentions ""killing myself."" This rules out 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die.
    - The post explicitly states ""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"" and no methods or preparations are mentioned. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - No past initiated actions are described. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings or a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""take them all"" in the context of ""counting my pills"" strongly implies an overdose, which is a specific method.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""wonder why i didnt take them all,"" ""why am i such a coward,"" ""living a life nobody loves or cares for me in"" indicate hopelessness, self-deprecation, and a feeling of being a burden. The ""coward"" comment suggests a desire to have acted on suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""pills"" is the substance/tool. ""take them all"" is the method (overdose). ""every night i count my pills"" can be interpreted as a form of preparation or at least a constant engagement with the means, indicating the means are present and being considered.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""why i didnt take them all"" refers to a past *inaction*, not a past initiated attempt. The writer is questioning why they *haven't* taken action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""every night"" and ""every day"" indicate ongoing contemplation and engagement with the means.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer's regret about not taking the pills (""wonder why i didnt take them all"") and self-criticism (""coward"") for not doing so clearly indicate a desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes. The regret (""why I didn't take them all"") and self-criticism (""coward"") for not acting on the implied overdose clearly convey a desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they express regret for *not* acting.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""pills"" and ""take them all"" clearly imply an overdose as a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""every night i count my pills"" indicates the means are present, accessible, and being regularly engaged with, which can be considered a form of preparation or at least a strong indication of a specific plan being considered.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes an ongoing, current contemplation and engagement with the means (""every night i count my pills""). The ""didn't take them all"" refers to past opportunities where action was *not* taken.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The post explicitly states ""why i didnt take them all,"" meaning an attempt was *not* initiated. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') because there's a clear personal desire to die and suicidal intent (""wonder why I didn't take them all"").
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts ('Ideation') because a specific method (""pills,"" ""take them all"") is mentioned, and there's an ongoing engagement with these means (""every night i count my pills""). This constitutes a plan/method.
    *   It does not describe an initiated action ('Attempt') because the post explicitly states the action was *not* taken (""why i didnt take them all"").

Based on the explicit desire to die, the mention of a specific method (pills/overdose), and the ongoing engagement with the means (""counting my pills""), the post fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

51,The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately. Idk why but in the past few months my thoughts have been in a major downward spiral. Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me. I've been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I don't want to end up in the psych ward again. I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No explicit mentions of these. The phrase ""downward spiral"" and ""unbearably strong thoughts"" imply severe distress, but not explicitly suicidal content.
    - Emotional indicators: ""unbearably strong,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""struggle,"" ""don't know what to do."" These indicate significant emotional distress, overwhelm, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""end up in the psych ward again."" This indicates a past hospitalization for mental health, but not a past suicide attempt.
    - Imminence: The struggle is described as current and ongoing (""lately,"" ""everyday"").
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses distress about ""thoughts"" and a ""downward spiral,"" and the struggle to get through the day. There is no explicit statement of a desire to die or to commit suicide. The focus is on the overwhelming nature of the thoughts and the difficulty of coping, coupled with a fear of re-hospitalization.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The post describes the *strength* of the thoughts and a ""downward spiral,"" which *could* be interpreted as suicidal thoughts, but the writer does not state ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't here."" The primary sentiment conveyed is distress about the *thoughts* and the *struggle* itself, rather than a personal desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? While not explicitly stated, the phrasing ""The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately"" and the focus on the *struggle* to make it through the day suggests these thoughts are intrusive and unwanted, rather than representing a personal desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, ongoing struggle (""lately,"" ""everyday""). The ""psych ward again"" refers to a past experience, but not a past suicidal action.
    - Crucially, does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly indicates significant distress, hopelessness, and a struggle with overwhelming ""thoughts."" It mentions a history of mental health hospitalization.
    - However, it *lacks* an explicit personal statement of desire to die or suicidal intent. The ""thoughts"" are described as strong and part of a ""downward spiral,"" but the author does not claim these thoughts as their own desire to die. The post focuses on the *struggle* with these thoughts and the fear of hospitalization, not a desire to act on them.
    - There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - Based on the definitions:
        - 'Attempt' is ruled out as no past action is described.
        - 'Behavior' is ruled out as there is no plan, method, or preparation.
        - 'Ideation' is ruled out because there is no *explicit personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent*. While the ""thoughts"" might be suicidal, the author does not state ""I want to die"" or ""I'm going to end it all."" The post expresses distress about the *thoughts* themselves and the struggle, rather than a personal desire to die.
        - 'Indicator' fits best: The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and discusses overwhelming thoughts, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, as per the rule, leads to 'Indicator'.

    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: None related to suicidal acts.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""), but the phrasing ""I don't wanna do this anymore"" and ""lost all will to live"" indicates a current state of despair and desire for death.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire to die (""lost all will to live,"" ""want to die""). It is not presented as unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""want to die"" and ""lost all will to live"" are clear expressions of intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't wanna do this anymore,"" ""lost all will to live,"" ""want to die.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out a suicidal act. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, but without a plan, method, or preparations.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""my death,"" ""don't want to live anymore,"" ""when i off myself."" The phrase ""off myself"" is a direct euphemism for suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""can't keep living with depression,"" ""can't continue to live for decades to come."" These indicate hopelessness and despair, and a desire to end their life.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. There are no details about how, where, or when they would ""off myself,"" nor any mention of acquiring means or making preparations.
    *   References to past actions: None.
    *   Imminence: Not explicitly stated as immediate (""tonight,"" ""soon""), but the desire to not live ""for decades to come"" indicates a current and strong desire to end their life.
    *   Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, genuine wish to die (""I don't want to live anymore,"" ""when I off myself""). The concern about their mother is a mitigating factor or a reason for internal conflict, but it does not negate the underlying suicidal intent.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""when i off myself"" is a direct, albeit euphemistic, statement of suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to live anymore"" and ""can't continue to live for decades to come"" clearly express this desire.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is expressing a desire to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts. The concern about the mother is a reason for hesitation, not a negation of the desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire and a future intention (""what kind of impact will my death have,"" ""when i off myself"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I don't want to live anymore,"" ""when i off myself""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations (e.g., ""how"" they would ""off myself""). Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated action. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

    - Emotional indicators: ""mentally ill,"" ""can't afford treatment,"" ""can't hold work,"" ""don't have energy,"" ""health is shit,"" ""what's the fucking point in any of this,"" ""fed up of all this bullshit."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.

    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""just killing myself"") and a lack of desire to continue living (""what's the fucking point in any of this,"" ""what's the point in not"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""just killing myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""what's the fucking point in any of this"" and the concluding ""what's the point in not"" strongly convey a desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; the writer seems to accept or even rationalize the idea of killing themselves.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and a desire to die (""just killing myself,"" ""what's the point in not""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kms"" (kill myself). The phrase ""You look like you're about to die"" is a quote from someone else, but the author's response confirms their state.
    - Emotional indicators: ""depressed af""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No current or future plan/method/preparation is mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""tried to kms yesterday"" - this is a direct reference to a past, initiated action.
    - Imminence: The action occurred ""yesterday"".
    - Writer's stated desire: The post clearly indicates a past desire to die, evidenced by the attempt, and current distress.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kms"" (kill myself).
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, through the description of the past attempt.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states they *tried* to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method or preparation for a *current or future* act is mentioned. The past action (""tried to kms"") implies a method was used, but it's not detailed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""tried to kms yesterday"") and a current emotional state (""Iam depressed af"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""tried to kms yesterday"" clearly describes an initiated, potentially lethal action that occurred in the recent past.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The defining element of this post is the explicit mention of a past initiated action: ""tried to kms yesterday"".
    - This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death"".
    - While the author is currently depressed, the primary suicidal content described is a past action.

**1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    - **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" strongly implies suicide, especially when coupled with ""I can't live anymore."" The ""do this"" refers to ending life. No specific method is mentioned, only a desired characteristic (""non painful"").
    - **Emotional indicators:** ""I absolutely cannot fight anymore,"" ""non stop pain and suffering,"" ""I can't. Please. I can't live anymore."" These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, and a desire for relief from suffering.
    - **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None are mentioned. The desire for a ""non painful way"" is a *type* of method, not a specific one.
    - **References to past actions:** None.
    - **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I can't live anymore"" suggests current and overwhelming distress, but no specific timeline for an action.
    - **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, strong desire to die or not be alive (""I can't live anymore,"" ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"").

**2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly using those exact words.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly and strongly through ""I can't live anymore"" and the search for a ""non painful way to do this"" (referring to ending life).
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present and expressed as a personal wish.

**3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""Non painful way"" is a characteristic of a method, not a specific method itself.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

**4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current intention/desire.

**5. CATEGORY REASONING:**
    - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die and end suffering (""I can't live anymore,"" ""There has to be a non painful way to do this""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific pills, a gun, a location, writing a note). The desire for a ""non painful way"" is a general preference for a method type, not a specific method or plan. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a future intention (""next week"").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent.
    - 'Ideation' is ruled out because there is a specific method (""with drugs"") and preparation (""write a suicide note"") mentioned, which goes beyond just thoughts/desire.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the post describes a future plan, not a past or very recent initiated action.
    - 'Behavior' is the best fit as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions a specific method and preparations being taken for a future act.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, the phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."" in the context of overwhelming despair strongly implies a desire for life to end.
    - Emotional indicators: ""always tired,"" ""so tired,"" ""no motivation,"" ""tired of being sick,"" ""tired of working,"" ""lonely,"" ""jealous."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and anhedonia.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The reference to ""pills"" is in the context of medication for illness (""none of the pills do enough and I'm almost out of ones to try""), not as a means for suicide.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""soon,"" ""long overdue"" suggest a sense of readiness for ""this"" (life/suffering) to end.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."" clearly expresses a desire for life to end, or for the current state of suffering to cease, which is a form of suicidal intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."" in this context conveys a clear desire for life to be over.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses readiness for it.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a future intention (""ready to get this over with soon"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire for life to end (""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue.""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, indicating a personal suicidal intent. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out suicide. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of a clear desire to not be alive, without a specific plan, fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

59,"I finally went through. I regret everything that led me to this point. I have overdosed. I regret it. I also don't. I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over. I took 500mg Zoloft, so it won't kill me, but it'll punish me for being such a nuisance to society. It hasn't been that long, but I'm getting a headache and some other bullshit. I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""I have overdosed. I took 500mg Zoloft."" This is a clear mention of a self-harm act involving a specific substance and method. The phrase ""it won't kill me, but it'll punish me"" indicates an intent for self-harm/punishment, even if not explicitly death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I regret everything,"" ""I regret it. I also don't,"" ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over,"" ""punish me for being such a nuisance to society,"" ""I'm sorry."" These indicate significant distress, ambivalence, and self-deprecating thoughts.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** The post describes an action that *has already occurred*: ""I have overdosed. I took 500mg Zoloft."" This is a concrete method.
    *   **References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed:** ""I finally went through. I have overdosed. I took 500mg Zoloft."" This describes a completed, self-initiated action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""It hasn't been that long, but I'm getting a headache and some other bullshit."" This indicates the action was very recent.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over."" This is a complex statement. While they explicitly state ""I don't want to die,"" they have *already initiated a potentially harmful action* (overdose) with the stated goal of ending ""suffering"" and ""punishing"" themselves. The action itself, despite the stated desire, is a critical indicator.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? ""I just want my suffering to be over."" This expresses a desire to end suffering, which is often a driving force behind suicidal actions, even if the direct desire for death is negated.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? They state ""I don't want to die,"" but they *have already acted* in a way that is potentially harmful and linked to ending suffering. The action takes precedence over the stated desire in this context.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""overdosed,"" ""took 500mg Zoloft."" This is a specific method and substance.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act itself (""took 500mg Zoloft"") implies preparation. *However, this step is primarily for future plans. The key here is that the action has already occurred.*

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *past, very recent, initiated action*: ""I finally went through,"" ""I have overdosed,"" ""I took 500mg Zoloft."" ""It hasn't been that long.""
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes. The act of overdosing on 500mg Zoloft is a specific, self-initiated action. While the author states ""it won't kill me,"" any overdose is potentially lethal or harmful, and the intent to ""punish"" oneself and end ""suffering"" through such means aligns with the definition of an attempt. The definition of 'Attempt' includes actions that were ""potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes a *past, initiated, potentially harmful action* (""I have overdosed,"" ""I took 500mg Zoloft"").
    *   Even though the author states ""I don't want to die,"" the action taken (overdose) with the explicit goal of ""punishing"" oneself and ending ""suffering"" fits the definition of an 'Attempt'. The key is the *initiated action* that was potentially lethal or seriously harmful. The statement ""it won't kill me"" might be a misjudgment or a way to cope, but the action itself is a concrete attempt at self-harm/suicide.

Therefore, the classification is 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrases ""I'm doing it in the near future"" and ""ready to go"" strongly imply suicide/ending one's life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I feel so at peace right now, knowing I'm going to."" This indicates a resolute decision and a sense of calm often seen before an intended suicide.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific plan, method, tool, or location is mentioned. No explicit preparations like writing a note or acquiring means are stated. ""Spent some good time with my favourite person"" could be interpreted as a farewell, but it's not a concrete preparation for the act itself.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""in the near future"" indicates a current and future intention.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die/end their life (""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go,"" ""I'm ready"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly, but the context (""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go,"" ""at peace knowing I'm going to"") leaves no doubt about the suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, absolutely. ""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go,"" ""I'm ready.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite; they express peace and readiness.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation for the act itself (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills""). The ""spending good time"" is ambiguous as a preparation for the act itself.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current decision and a future intention (""in the near future"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, this is a statement of future intent, not a past or recent initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear, personal, current desire to end their life (""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go""). This goes beyond general distress and clearly falls under suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or concrete preparations for the act itself (e.g., specific pills, a weapon, a location, a note being written). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the clear expression of suicidal intent and desire to die, without a specific plan/method/preparation, the best fit is 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""i was suicidal"", referring to a past state.
    - Emotional indicators: Frustration and anger about a past experience (""high school counselors suck"", ""what the hell"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned, either for the past or present.
    - References to past actions: ""when my old high school found out i was suicidal"" and ""it was 4 yrs ago"". This refers to a past state of being suicidal, not a specific suicidal action or attempt.
    - Imminence: No current imminence of suicidal intent. The post is clearly focused on a past event.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is no stated desire to die or be suicidal in the present. The focus is on recounting a negative past experience.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""i was suicidal"". However, this is in the past tense and refers to a past state, not a current intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, not currently. The desire was in the past (""i was suicidal""), but the current post is about the school's reaction.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as the focus is on a past state and a past interaction.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""it was 4 yrs ago"") where the author *was* suicidal. There is no current or future intention expressed.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. It states ""i was suicidal"", which is a state of being, not a description of a concrete action or attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post refers to a past state of being suicidal (""i was suicidal... 4 yrs ago"") and expresses frustration about how it was handled by school staff.
    - There is no current expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or preparation.
    - It does not describe a past *attempt* (a specific initiated action), only a past state of suicidal ideation.
    - Given the lack of current suicidal intent and the focus on a past event without describing an attempt, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category. It reflects general distress about a past experience related to mental health, without current suicidal risk.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Might as well just die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post explores the reasons for sadness and contemplates acting on the suicidal thoughts, rather than rejecting them.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i should die,"" ""kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""trash,"" ""rubbish sucking at everything,"" ""hate my family,"" ""no friends,"" ""so sensitive,"" ""suffer from u."" These indicate feelings of worthlessness, burden, despair, and isolation.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything."" This explicitly states preparation.
    - References to past actions: ""had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything"" refers to a decision and preparation made recently.
    - Imminence: ""prepared everything"" suggests readiness, though no specific timeline like ""tonight"" is given.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""i should die,"" ""made up my mind to kill myself"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""i should die,"" expressing a clear desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post states, ""I have prepared everything."" This is a direct indication of preparations being made for a suicidal act. While a specific method isn't named, the act of ""preparing everything"" signifies a concrete step towards execution.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current desire (""i should die"") and refers to a recent decision and preparation (""had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything"").
    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* in the past or very recently. It describes the *preparation* for such an action, not the action itself. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die, which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly mentions ""prepared everything,"" which constitutes a plan or preparation. This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    - The post does not describe an *initiated* suicidal act (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). It describes the state of having prepared for one. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""Vanish without a trace,"" ""no one will find my body,"" ""at the end,"" ""pistol."" These strongly imply self-inflicted death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Nothing to look forward to,"" ""tired of my presence,"" ""unphased by the realization,"" ""never seemed to enjoy my company."" These indicate hopelessness, feeling like a burden, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:**
        *   **Plan:** ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them, pick a direction, and start walking. No phone or car to trace me, just cash and a pair of shoes. Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body."" This is a detailed plan.
        *   **Method/Tool:** ""Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol."" This is a specific lethal means.
        *   **Preparations:** ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them."" This is a clear preparation (giving away possessions).
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""Dont know when, but eventually..."" The plan is conditional on a future event (roommates asking them to leave), so it's not immediately imminent, but the detailed plan is for *when* that event occurs.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""So I would want to vanish without a trace."" This is an explicit desire to end their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words, but ""vanish without a trace,"" ""no one will find my body,"" and ""pistol...at the end"" clearly convey suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I would want to vanish without a trace,"" and ""nothing to look forward to.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly stated and planned for.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""a pistol"" is explicitly mentioned as the intended tool. ""Secluded spot where no one will find my body"" is a specific type of location.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them"" are clear signs of preparation (giving away possessions).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention and plan, conditional on a specific event.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's a future plan, not a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

        *   ""I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge."" - Indicates high imminence.
        *   ""I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face"" - Past self-harm, but not described as a suicidal attempt.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""no one cares right now,"" ""I just feel so disconected,"" ""rotting away in my flat on my own""), despair (""somewhere else dark and cant see""), feeling like a burden (""I feel i bring the mood down"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   **Location:** ""the woodland where i would do it"" - A specific location has been decided.
        *   **Preparations:** ""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police."" - Detailed post-act preparations are described.
        *   **Method:** No specific method is stated as acquired or chosen, but the planning around the *location* and *post-act discovery* is very concrete. The mention of ""rope"" is in the negative.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years"" (ongoing state). Past self-harm as a child, but not a suicidal attempt.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge."" - Very high sense of imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I dont want the existance ive got."" - Clear desire to die/not exist. The overall tone, despite acknowledging temporary feelings, points to a strong desire to end life due to recurring suffering and explicit planning.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""when i do do it"".
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive (""I dont want the existance ive got."").
    *   The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions; rather, they describe a long-standing desire to end their existence and are actively planning for it, despite acknowledging temporary shifts in mood.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific location (""the woodland"") is mentioned in relation to a suicidal act.
    *   Yes, there are clear signs of preparation: ""leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police."" This is a concrete plan for after the act.
    *   While a specific *method* isn't chosen or acquired, the chosen *location* and *post-act preparations* are sufficient to indicate a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a long-standing suicidal state (""suicidal for about 10 years"") and current/future intentions (""when i do do it,"" ""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it,"" ""how i will leave notes"").
    *   It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* in the past or very recently. The past self-harm mentioned is not described as a suicidal attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is strong ideation, there are also explicit mentions of concrete planning elements (specific location, post-act preparations).
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""suicidal,"" ""I dont want the existance ive got"") AND clearly mentions a specific plan and preparations: choosing a specific location (""the woodland where i would do it"") and planning post-act actions (""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers... and to call the police""). The pushing away of loved ones also serves as a preparation to make it ""easier to do something.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past or very recent *initiated* suicidal action is described.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore .

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal"", ""tonight's the night I guess"", ""when I'm gone"", ""help me stay alive"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""desperate to get help"", ""hopeless"", ""No one in my life cares"", ""No one to talk to"", ""No one to help me stay alive"", ""No one in my life will miss me"". These indicate severe emotional distress, isolation, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) or location (e.g., bridge) is mentioned. No specific preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""tonight's the night I guess"" indicates imminence but not a method.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""tonight's the night I guess"" strongly suggests immediate intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrase ""tonight's the night I guess"" combined with ""suicidal"" and ""when I'm gone"" clearly indicates a personal desire to die or end their life. While there's a conflicting ""desperate to get help,"" the overall tone and the ""tonight's the night"" statement lean heavily towards a current desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal"" is directly used. ""tonight's the night I guess"" is an explicit statement of intent to end life.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""tonight's the night I guess"" and ""No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone"" clearly express this.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement ""tonight's the night I guess"" indicates an intention to act, despite the concurrent feeling of wanting help. The desire to die is personally expressed.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. ""tonight's the night"" specifies *when*, but not *how*.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""tonight's the night I guess"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (""suicidal,"" ""tonight's the night I guess,"" ""when I'm gone""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - While there is strong imminence (""tonight's the night""), there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., ""I'm going to take pills,"" ""I have a gun,"" ""I'm going to jump from X""). Without a *how*, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal intent and desire to die, with a sense of imminence, but without a specific plan, method, or preparation.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: Yes, ""oxy and cutting an artery"" are specific, potentially lethal methods.
    - Emotional indicators: ""im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask"" indicates distress and a search for information related to these methods.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""Oxy"" (substance) and ""cutting an artery"" (method) are explicitly mentioned. The question ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"" indicates a consideration of combining methods and practical aspects of carrying out such an act, which leans towards planning.
    - References to past actions: No.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated, but the direct question about methods suggests a current, active consideration.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: While not explicitly stating ""I want to die,"" the detailed inquiry about specific lethal methods and how to make them less painful strongly implies a personal consideration of suicide and a desire to carry it out. It's not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a practical question about performing the act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Not explicitly with phrases like ""I want to die,"" but the detailed question about *how* to perform a specific lethal act (combining oxy with cutting an artery to lessen pain) strongly implies a personal desire to carry out such an act. The context is not hypothetical or abstract.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the question is about facilitating the act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""oxy"" (substance) and ""cutting an artery"" (method).
    - Are there signs of preparation? The question about combining methods to lessen pain can be interpreted as exploring or refining a plan. It's not just a thought; it's a practical inquiry about execution.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current consideration of future action.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it's a question about *how* to do it, not that it has been done.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') because it involves specific, lethal methods.
    - It goes beyond just expressing a desire to die ('Ideation') because it explicitly mentions specific methods (""oxy,"" ""cutting an artery"") and asks a practical question about their execution (""lessen the pain""). This level of detail about *how* to carry out a suicidal act, even if framed as a question, constitutes a discussion of a plan/method.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of specific methods and a practical question about their execution clearly places it in 'Behavior'.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post repeatedly mentions ""kill myself,"" ""commit suicide,"" and ""going to die."" However, these are consistently attributed to the friend's statement (""my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself,"" ""If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide""). The author is reacting to these statements made *by the friend*, not expressing their own suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author expresses being hurt, upset, feeling like a doormat, and struggling with how to confront the friend. They are seeking advice on an interpersonal conflict.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned by the author for themselves.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions by the author are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** No intentions are stated by the author. The imminence is related to the friend's prediction, which the author is distressed by.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states, ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" which indicates a desire to live and manage their health, not a desire to die. The core of the post is about the author's distress over their friend's hurtful words and seeking advice on how to handle the situation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, but *only* as quotes or references to what the friend said.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive?** No. The author is expressing distress about the friend's words and seeking advice on how to deal with the friend. The author states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness.""
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** The author's statement ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"" implies a rejection of the friend's prediction and a desire to live. The suicidal thoughts are presented as coming from the friend, not the author.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned in relation to any suicidal act by the author.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past conversation and the ongoing emotional impact of that conversation on the author.
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post's primary focus is the author's emotional reaction to a friend's hurtful and insensitive comments about the author's mental health.
    *   While words like ""suicide"" and ""kill myself"" appear, they are always in the context of what the friend said or the author's interpretation of the friend's words. They are not expressions of the author's own current suicidal intent or desire.
    *   The author explicitly states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" which directly contradicts any personal suicidal desire.
    *   There is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, no desire to not be alive, no plan, no method, and no description of a past attempt by the author.
    *   This fits the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" The discussion of suicide is abstract in the sense that it's about the friend's perception, not the author's current state.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""jump out"" (from a window) implies a lethal action. ""scissors"" and ""cut the screen"" are related to preparing for this action.
    - Emotional indicators: ""please please please help me,"" ""i feel like im about to,"" ""i dont know what to do,"" ""im only a teen,"" ""parents and siblings are asleep."" These indicate extreme distress, a feeling of being overwhelmed, isolation, and a plea for intervention.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: Yes.
        - Location: ""at my window right now.""
        - Tool: ""with scissors.""
        - Method/Preparation: ""about to cut the screen and jump out."" This describes the specific steps and means.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""right now,"" ""about to."" This indicates extreme imminence.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer is expressing a strong urge to act on a suicidal impulse (""i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out"") while simultaneously asking for help, indicating a struggle with the impulse. The core desire is to act on the suicidal thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""jump out"" from a window clearly implies a desire to end their life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The ""I don't know what to do"" and ""please help me"" suggest a struggle and a desire for intervention, but the primary statement is about being on the verge of acting, not merely having unwanted thoughts without a desire to act. The *imminence* of the action is key.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes.
        - Location: ""at my window right now.""
        - Tool: ""with scissors.""
        - Method: ""jump out.""
        - Preparation: ""cut the screen"" (with scissors, to facilitate jumping).
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, being at the window with scissors, describing the immediate next step (""cut the screen"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes an imminent current/future intention (""right now,"" ""about to"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, the action is described as being on the verge of initiation, not already initiated and stopped/failed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to act on suicidal thoughts (implied by ""jump out"") and is not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post includes a very specific plan, method, and active preparation: being at the window, with scissors, and describing the immediate steps (""cut the screen and jump out""). This goes beyond mere 'Ideation' which lacks a specific plan/method/preparation.
    - The action is described as imminent (""about to""), not as a past initiated action that was potentially lethal. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal desire (implied by the action) *and* a specific plan, method, and active preparation (at the window, with scissors, about to cut the screen and jump) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement is an active intention.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""iron pills"" is a specific substance and ""overdose"" is a specific method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""i'm gonna overdose on iron pills"" implies a plan and the availability or intention to acquire the means, which constitutes a specific method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""i'm gonna"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's a future intention, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""i don't wanna deal with it"" and the intent to overdose).
    - It also clearly mentions a specific method (""overdose on iron pills"").
    - This combination of explicit suicidal intent and a specific method/plan fits the definition of 'Behavior'. It is not 'Ideation' because a specific method is mentioned. It is not 'Attempt' because it describes a future intention, not a past initiated action.

73,"im going to kill myself one day. am in high school and just got deferred from my dream school. i have waited and endured for so long cuz i thought i would escape in college. my life, i dont even know what that is. life. i dont even know since it isnt even mine. i hate it! why do MY parents have to be absuive, but rich enough to control me financially so that i dont run away? i dont have money, a license, friends, nothing and i feel like a failure who might as well die. i seriously am that person everyone makes fun of at school. even on fucking zoom, when i was stuttering the entire time during an online presentation when everyone, my crush &amp; the closest thing i have to a friend in that class, everyone! even my teacher! was making fun of me. i hate them and my parents and i just want to disappear, like i dont even want their pity, or want them to ever know they got to me, but i just want to run away to a forest and fucking die. the only thing thats stopping is that there is still a chance to get in to a college somewhere far, far away with a full scholarship and never see anyone from my past life again. but the chances of that are so slim so i dont even know.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""im going to kill myself one day,"" ""might as well die,"" ""just want to run away to a forest and fucking die."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal intent and desire for death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""deferred from my dream school,"" ""chances of that are so slim""), despair, feeling trapped (""parents have to be abusive, but rich enough to control me financially""), self-loathing (""feel like a failure,"" ""that person everyone makes fun of"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" mentions a location (""forest"") but does not specify a *method* of suicide (e.g., pills, gun, jumping, hanging) or any preparation. It's more of a desire to escape and then die, without a concrete plan for *how* to die.
    *   **References to past actions:** None related to suicide.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** ""one day"" suggests a future possibility, but ""might as well die"" and ""just want to disappear... and fucking die"" express a current desire.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and genuine desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""might as well die,"" ""want to disappear... and fucking die"").
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; they are expressing their own desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A location (""forest"") is mentioned, but it is not linked to a specific, actionable *method* of suicide. The phrase ""fucking die"" is the outcome, not the method. There are no tools, substances, or preparations mentioned. The instruction states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" The mention of a ""forest"" is not a specific method like ""overdosing"" or ""jumping from a bridge.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and future/present intentions (""im going to kill myself one day,"" ""just want to disappear... and fucking die"").
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action was initiated in the past or very recently.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. While a location (""forest"") is mentioned, it is not accompanied by a specific *method* or *preparation* for suicide. The desire is to ""run away to a forest and fucking die,"" which is still a general desire for death in an isolated place, not a concrete plan for *how* to die. Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior',"" 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""Hoping to be murdered,"" ""I hate being alive,"" ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself,"" ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""terminally suicidal people,"" ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night,"" ""to just end it all,"" ""cowardice with killing myself,"" ""how much I want to die,"" ""pray for some random person to murder me.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hate being alive,"" ""losing more hope,"" ""sisyphean and a vicious cycle,"" ""increasingly difficult to endure,"" ""tearing up randomly,"" ""crying myself to sleep,"" ""useless I am,"" ""alone I am,"" ""defective and unfit to be alive."" (Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, self-worthlessness).
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** No *self-initiated* plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The methods discussed are external (being murdered, assisted suicide). The walking in ""sketchy areas"" is a passive hope for an external event, not an active plan for self-harm.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past self-initiated suicidal actions are mentioned. The post explicitly states ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself.""
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** No specific imminence for a self-initiated act. The desire for external death is ongoing (""every night,"" ""every single day"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a very strong, explicit, and current desire to die and not be alive. However, the author explicitly states an inability to perform the act themselves (""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself"") and wishes for an external force to end their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes (""kill myself,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""end it all,"" ""want to die"").
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes (""I hate being alive,"" ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me,"" ""how much I want to die"").
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer *wants* to die, but lacks the personal capacity/bravery to act on it themselves, wishing for an external force. This is not an ""unwanted thought.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a *self-initiated* suicidal act? No. The methods mentioned (""murdered,"" ""assisted suicide"") are external and not self-initiated. There is no mention of pills, guns, ropes, specific bridges *for self-harm*, or any other tool/location for a self-initiated act.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current and ongoing desire for death and a passive, repeated hope for an external event.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The post explicitly states the author lacks the bravery to kill themselves, ruling out a past initiated attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""I hate being alive,"" ""how much I want to die,"" ""to just end it all""). This clearly moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, the post explicitly states a lack of personal ability or bravery to *kill themselves* and expresses a wish for an *external* force (murder, assisted suicide) to end their life. There is no mention of a *self-initiated* plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific means, tools, locations, or preparatory actions for self-harm).
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires a self-initiated plan/method/preparation).
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out."" The desire to die is present and explicit, but the self-initiated plan/method is absent.

Take care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to die"", ""leave"", ""See you all on the other side"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""glad I'm going to die"", ""experience it painfully"", ""unwanted"", ""can't take no more"". Strong despair and desire for death.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Painfully"" describes the *experience* of dying, not a method. ""See you all on the other side. Take care."" is a farewell, not a concrete preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave"", ""See you all on the other side"" suggests a current, strong intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear, explicit desire to die and not be alive, even expressing being ""glad"" about it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases, but ""I'm going to die"" and ""I'm going to leave"" in this context are direct expressions of intent to end life.
    - Expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, very clearly: ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave"", ""can't take no more"", ""See you all on the other side.""
    - States they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is expressed (""glad"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. ""Painfully"" is a characteristic, not a method.
    - Signs of preparation? No concrete preparations like writing a note or acquiring means. ""See you all on the other side. Take care."" is a farewell, but not a preparation for the act itself.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Describes a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention: ""I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave"".
    - Describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave"", ""See you all on the other side""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific pills, a gun, a location, or writing a note). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or specific methods/means. However, phrases like ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" and ""I'm starting to want to wave the white flag"" strongly imply a desire to end their life or current existence. ""I am starting to not care if there's an afterlife or not"" also points towards contemplating death.
    - Emotional indicators: High levels of hopelessness (""tired of only feeling sadness and anxiety,"" ""tired of the depression and anxiety,"" ""tired of being a burden,"" ""My soul is hurting,"" ""don't think I can do it anymore""), despair (""no one is here for me right now""), and anhedonia (""only source of happiness being inebriated"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquiring means.
    - References to past actions: ""I've tried every antidepressant,"" ""I've tried every way to cope."" These refer to coping mechanisms and treatments, not past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: The language suggests a current, ongoing state of despair and a growing desire to give up, but no immediate timeline or specific action.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear stated desire to ""not be here"" and to ""not do it anymore,"" which indicates a wish to end their current suffering and implicitly, their life. There is no negation of this desire.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" and ""I'm starting to want to wave the white flag"" clearly convey a desire to end their existence or current state of suffering, which is a form of suicidal ideation.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as a personal feeling.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of profound despair and a current desire to end it.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses more than general distress; it conveys a clear personal desire to not be alive (""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" ""wave the white flag""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated potentially lethal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""I have to kill myself"" and ""Death is my only option right now.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""nothing,"" ""no reason to stay here,"" ""crappy life,"" ""future is fucked,"" ""no friends,"" ""head has gone to shit,"" ""nothing is going well,"" ""isn't getting better,"" ""worse staying alive."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. There are no details about how the person intends to kill themselves, no tools, locations, or preparatory actions.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""right now,"" ""have to do this."" This suggests a current and strong intention.
    - Asses the writer's stated desire: There is a clear and strong stated desire to die (""I have to kill myself,"" ""Death is my only option,"" ""I have to do this"").

    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a strong desire to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die but no specific plan, method, or preparation, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current and future intention (""I have to kill myself,"" ""Death is my only option right now,"" ""I have to do this"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. There is no mention of an initiated attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, explicit, and personal expression of suicidal intent (""I have to kill myself,"" ""Death is my only option"").
    - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, tool, or preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""he was suicidal like me some time ago"" (acknowledges past suicidal feelings in self), ""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" ""I just wish I could donate my life."" The concept of ""donating a life"" is a metaphorical way of expressing a desire to die or not exist.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't deserve, nor want to live""), self-sacrifice, feeling like a burden (implied by ""making lots of people happy"" if they were gone).
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None. The idea of ""donating a life"" is abstract, not a concrete method.
    - References to past actions: ""suicidal like me some time ago"" refers to past *feelings*, not a past *attempt*.
    - Imminence: No specific temporal markers for immediate action.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" is a clear, explicit statement of not wanting to be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not for current intent, but it uses ""suicidal like me"" for past feelings and ""don't want to live"" and ""donate my life"" for current desire.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and ""I just wish I could donate my life"" clearly indicate a desire to not be alive.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire not to live is presented as a personal wish.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No. ""Donate my life"" is a conceptual wish, not a method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past suicidal feelings (""suicidal like me some time ago"") and current desire/intent (""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" ""I just wish I could donate my life"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The mention of ""suicidal like me some time ago"" refers to past *feelings* or *ideation*, not a concrete *attempt*.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon,"" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""tired of it,"" ""fucking joke,"" ""waste of time and energy,"" despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" This is a concrete action of ceasing vital care, which can be considered a form of self-neglect or preparation for a decline leading to death. ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" is mentioned as a method, albeit a passive, long-term one.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""today"" (stopping meds), ""soon"" (ending).
    - Stated desire: Clear desire to die (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die: ""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon.""
    - The writer does not negate these thoughts; they embrace them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific action/preparation is mentioned: ""I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" This is a deliberate cessation of treatment, including critical medical and psychiatric medications, which is a concrete step taken by the author that could lead to severe health deterioration or mental health crisis, aligning with ""preparations being taken"" or a passive method of self-harm/neglect to hasten death.
    - ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" is also a method, though less immediate.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current/future intentions and actions (""I'm ready to die,"" ""I'm stopping all my meds today"").
    - It does not describe a past, initiated, potentially lethal action (an 'Attempt').

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal desire to die.
    - It's not just 'Ideation' because there is a specific, concrete action/preparation mentioned: ""I'm stopping all my meds today."" This goes beyond mere thoughts or desires and includes a deliberate step to cease care, which can be seen as a preparation for death or a passive method.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past, initiated, potentially lethal action is described. The actions described are current/future preparations/methods.
    - The explicit desire to die combined with the concrete action of stopping all medications (which can severely impact health and mental stability, thus contributing to the desired outcome of death) fits the definition of 'Behavior' (explicit ideation + plan/method/preparation).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Broken remainings of my soul,"" ""all this pain"" indicate deep despair and suffering. ""I just want to disappear"" suggests a desire to escape existence.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not specified, but the desire is current.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear desire to ""disappear"" and be ""free from all this pain,"" which implies a wish to cease existing or not be alive to escape suffering.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? ""I just want to disappear"" and ""free from all this pain"" strongly convey a personal desire to escape existence and suffering. While not using the word ""die,"" it expresses a wish to no longer be in their current state of being, which aligns with a desire to not be alive.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a personal wish.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A current desire/intention.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') by expressing a clear personal desire to ""disappear"" and be ""free from all this pain,"" which indicates a desire to not be alive. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide"".
    *   Emotional indicators: The rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" indicates extreme distress, hopelessness, and a challenge to find reasons to live.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The explicit statement ""Ps: I just need a plan for suicide"" indicates a current intent to formulate or acquire a plan. This is a direct reference to a planning stage.
    *   References to past actions: None.
    *   Imminence: ""Goodnight"" could suggest a finality, but the ""Ps"" indicates a current state of mind and a future-oriented need for a plan.
    *   Writer's stated desire: The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"") and an active step towards achieving that (""I just need a plan for suicide"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die, expressed through the rhetorical question and the subsequent statement about needing a plan.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them. On the contrary, they are seeking a plan.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method, tool, substance, or location is *not yet* mentioned.
    *   However, the post explicitly states ""I just need a plan for suicide."" This is a direct indication of seeking or formulating a plan. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" While the plan itself isn't detailed, the *need for a plan* is stated, which falls under the umbrella of planning or preparation. It signifies a step beyond mere ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state and a future intention (to get a plan).
    *   It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'Indicator' is incorrect because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and a desire to die.
    *   'Ideation' is incorrect because the post goes beyond just thoughts/desire. The statement ""I just need a plan for suicide"" moves it into the realm of active planning or preparation, even if the plan isn't fully formed or detailed. The user is actively seeking the *how*.
    *   'Behavior' is the best fit. The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"") AND explicitly mentions the need for a plan (""I just need a plan for suicide""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which states it ""also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" The stated need for a plan is a form of preparation or active planning.
    *   'Attempt' is incorrect as no past or very recent initiated action is described.

82,"I need to find someone who relates. Does anyone else find themselves almost uncontrollably saying ""I'm going to kill myself""? I say other things like ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (relating to my most recent failed attempt) and ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"". It's almost like Tourettes but I know it's not. I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I'm going to kill myself"" (explicit suicide), ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (implied context of a past attempt), ""my most recent failed attempt"" (explicit past attempt), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" (self-harm), ""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out"" (simulated method).
    - Emotional indicators: The user is seeking validation/understanding (""am I crazy or can anyone else relate?""), indicating distress about these intrusive thoughts/actions.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I'm going to kill myself"" and ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" are current intentions. ""Putting a finger gun in my mouth"" is a simulated action. The ""failed attempt"" implies a past plan/method.
    - References to past actions: ""my most recent failed attempt"" is a direct and clear reference to a past initiated, potentially lethal action.
    - Imminence: The ""I'm going to kill myself"" phrase is framed as ""uncontrollably saying,"" which suggests intrusive thoughts/utterances rather than an immediate, firm plan. However, the explicit past attempt is a concrete event.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is expressing distress about these intrusive thoughts/actions but the content of the thoughts/actions themselves indicates suicidal ideation and past behavior. The primary and most definitive element is the past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself"" and ""failed attempt"" explicitly mention suicide.
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die expressed in the ""I'm going to kill myself"" utterance, even if it's described as intrusive. The past ""failed attempt"" confirms a past desire and action.
    - The writer describes these thoughts/utterances as ""almost uncontrollably saying"" and ""almost like Tourettes,"" indicating they are unwanted *utterances*. However, the content of these utterances *is* suicidal intent. Crucially, the mention of a ""failed attempt"" is a statement of a past *action*, not just an unwanted thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - For current thoughts/actions: ""finger gun in my mouth"" is a simulated method. ""I'm going to kill myself"" and ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" are general intentions without specific current plans/methods.
    - For past actions: ""my most recent failed attempt"" implies a past method/plan was involved (e.g., ""stayed in the car"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both past events (""my most recent failed attempt"") and current/future intentions/simulations (""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly,"" ""putting a finger gun in my mouth"").
    - Crucially, it describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past: ""my most recent failed attempt."" This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit mention of a ""failed attempt.""
    - The definition of 'Attempt' specifically covers ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""
    - The presence of current ideation (""I'm going to kill myself"") and simulated behavior (""finger gun"") does not override the clear mention of a past attempt, as per the rule: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
    - The phrase ""my most recent failed attempt"" is a clear description of a past initiated action.

Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most fitting category.

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me. Girls and guys. I hate my life. I've lost all my sanity and I don't know what to do.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore,"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal."" It also says, ""I hate my life,"" and ""I've lost all my sanity.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Hate,"" ""condescending,"" ""mean,"" ""inferior,"" ""terrible,"" ""angry,"" ""abused,"" ""bullied,"" ""sick of it,"" ""lost all my sanity,"" ""don't know what to do."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The user talks about not having money for plastic surgery as a problem, but this is not a suicidal method or preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions past abuse and bullying, but no past *suicidal actions* (attempts) are described.
    *   **Imminence:** Expresses current feelings (""I genuinely do not want to live anymore,"" ""I'm angry and suicidal"") but no specific timeline for action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and direct stated desire to not live and an explicit mention of being suicidal. This is not about unwanted thoughts, but a personal feeling.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I'm angry and suicidal.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as personal and genuine.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there is a clear desire to die but no plan/method/preparation, it points towards 'Ideation'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and intentions (""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"") influenced by past experiences.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. There is no description of an initiated suicidal act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I genuinely do not want to live anymore,"" ""I'm angry and suicidal""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

84,"Is my life just going to be this endless torment forever. My best friend walked out on me a month ago now. I thought I was doing fine but just today I realised none of my other friends really give a shit about me.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'd rather kill myself now"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""endless torment,"" ""horrible,"" ""struggling,"" ""nobody to talk to,"" ""nothing to do,"" ""don't want it"" (referring to life).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    - Imminence: ""now"" (in ""kill myself now"").
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear desire to die is expressed (""If that's what my life is going to be I don't want it. I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day of this seemingly endless torment."").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"".
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'd rather kill myself now"").
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them; rather, they express a clear desire to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current distress and a current/future intention (""I'd rather kill myself now"").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I'd rather kill myself now"").
    - However, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.
    - This clearly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal desire to die. It is not 'Behavior' because there is no plan/method/preparation. It is not 'Attempt' because no past initiated action is described.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I want to kill myself,"" ""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger,"" ""how it would feel to die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared,"" ""don't want to leave my cats/friends,"" ""urge,"" ""too much of a pussy,"" ""can never bring myself to actually do it."" This shows significant ambivalence and internal struggle.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger"" imply a gun, but these are presented as an *urge* or a desired action that the author *cannot* perform (""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already,"" ""I can never bring myself to actually do it""). There is no mention of having acquired a gun, making preparations, or a specific location.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past initiated suicidal actions are described. The post mentions past *urges* and *thoughts* (""every single day I still have the urge,"" ""I lay in bed at night, thoughts...rushing through my head"").
    *   **Imminence:** The urges are described as daily and ongoing, but there's no immediate stated intention to act. In fact, the opposite is stated (""can never bring myself to actually do it"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I still have the urge to just blow my brains out"" clearly express a desire to die/suicidal intent. However, this is immediately qualified by strong counter-desires and an explicit statement of inability to act (""but I'm scared,"" ""I don't want to leave my cats/friends,"" ""I can never bring myself to actually do it""). Despite the ambivalence, the core desire/urge is present.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I want to kill myself,"" ""blow my brains out.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to kill myself,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""but I'm scared. And I don't want to leave my cats. I don't want to leave my friends. I don't want to. but every single day I still have the urge... I can never bring myself to actually do it."" While the thoughts/urges are present, there's a strong internal resistance and stated inability to act. However, the *desire* to die is still present despite the resistance. This pushes it beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? ""Blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger"" imply a gun, but these are presented as the *content of the urge* or a hypothetical action they *cannot* perform, not a concrete plan involving an actual means they possess or are acquiring. The post explicitly states, ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"" and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Conclusion: No specific plan, method (as in, *having* or *acquiring* the means), or preparation is identified.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current/ongoing urges and thoughts (""every single day I still have the urge,"" ""I lay in bed at night"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The post explicitly states, ""I can never bring myself to actually do it."" This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to kill myself,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, it explicitly states an inability to act on these thoughts (""I can never bring myself to actually do it,"" ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"") and lacks any mention of a concrete plan, method (as in, *having* or *acquiring* the means), or preparations. The implied method (gun) is part of the *urge* they *cannot* act on, not a plan. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' because it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without a concrete plan, method, or preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""kill me,"" ""murder me,"" ""end my horrible life."" The method is ""murder.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""i beg of you,"" ""horrible life"" indicate extreme despair and a strong desire for an end to suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: The post explicitly requests a method (""murder me"") and offers a specific location (""i'll dm the address""). This constitutes a specific plan involving a method and a means to facilitate it.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Implied by the direct plea and offer of immediate action (""i'll dm the address"").
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear and explicit desire to die (""kill me,"" ""end my horrible life""). This is not distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a direct plea for death.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but it explicitly requests to be killed/murdered, which is a direct expression of desire for death.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, unequivocally: ""kill me,"" ""end my horrible life.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer clearly desires the outcome.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, the method is ""murder,"" and a location is offered (""i'll dm the address""). This is a concrete element of a plan to achieve death, even if it involves another person.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Offering the address to facilitate the act is a form of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""kill me,"" ""i'll dm the address"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, this is not an 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out due to the clear and explicit desire for death.
    - 'Ideation' is ruled out because there is more than just thoughts/desire; there's a specific method requested (""murder me"") and a step to facilitate it (offering the address), which constitutes a plan/preparation for achieving death.
    - 'Behavior' fits because the post expresses a clear desire to die and includes a specific method (""murder"") and a step towards its execution/facilitation (""i'll dm the address""). This goes beyond mere ideation into active seeking of means for death.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out as no past or recently initiated action is described.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city. I haven't dated in years (I don't think I'm very attractive tbh, but this doesn't bother me that much). My family is nuts.

    - Emotional indicators: Dread, hopelessness, feeling trapped, feeling worse off, despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide/self-harm.
    - Imminence: No immediate intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states, ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen."" This is a direct negation of active suicidal intent. While they express a passive wish for things to be ""better if I didn't have to try anymore"" and a lack of fear of dying, they are not expressing a desire to actively end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"" suggests a desire for an end to suffering or non-existence, but it's passive and immediately followed by a negation of deliberate action.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" is a clear statement against acting on any such impulses.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a passive wish for an end to suffering (""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore"").
    - However, it explicitly states, ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen."" This crucial statement indicates a lack of current, personal desire to die by suicide or act on any potential suicidal thoughts.
    - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned (ruling out Behavior).
    - There is no description of a past initiated attempt (ruling out Attempt).
    - The explicit negation of deliberate action (""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"") means it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' which requires a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. Instead, it aligns with 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and discusses dying abstractly or as an unwanted thought/feeling, lacking a clear personal desire to die by suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger,"" ""thought about suicide,"" ""i just want to collapse and let go.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""disappointed,"" ""crushed and empty,"" ""too hard,"" ""pain,"" ""false hope.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""anniversary of something that could've been"" (not a suicidal action). No past suicidal *actions* are mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""today is the anniversary,"" ""now it's like i'm back to square one,"" ""suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger,"" ""i just want to collapse and let go"" (current desire).
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrase ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" combined with ""i just want to collapse and let go"" indicates a current, personal desire to die or cease to exist, not merely distress about unwanted thoughts. While they mention a past thought of ""powering through,"" the current state described is one of increasing suicidal intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""thought about suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just want to collapse and let go"" in this context clearly expresses a desire to cease to be or die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? While they mention a past period where they thought they could ""power through,"" the current state is described as ""back to square one"" with thoughts ""getting stronger and stronger,"" and the concluding phrase ""i just want to collapse and let go"" indicates a current desire to succumb to these thoughts or die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings, current strengthening suicidal thoughts, and a current desire (""i just want to collapse and let go""). It references a past anniversary and past feelings, but the suicidal content is current.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. There is no mention of any initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear, explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"") and a desire to not be alive (""i just want to collapse and let go""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific pills, a location, writing a note). Therefore, it does not fit the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the presence of explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die/cease to exist, but without a plan/method/preparation, the post best fits 'Ideation'.

89,"Everyone is asleep. I am planning to kill myself tonight. Everyone who could help me is asleep now. I don't wish them any grief or guilt. This is my problem, my illness, it's on me. I expect nothing from no one. Rest In Peace ya'll. ✌️",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""planning to kill myself tonight"", ""Rest In Peace ya'll"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't wish them any grief or guilt. This is my problem, my illness, it's on me. I expect nothing from no one."" (Resignation, taking responsibility, isolating).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""I am planning to kill myself tonight"" explicitly states a plan. The context ""Everyone is asleep. Everyone who could help me is asleep now"" indicates a specific chosen time and condition (lack of intervention) for the plan. ""Rest In Peace ya'll"" and the preceding sentences (""I don't wish them any grief or guilt. This is my problem, my illness, it's on me. I expect nothing from no one."") act as a farewell or a final note, which are forms of preparation. While a specific *method* (e.g., pills, gun) isn't mentioned, the *timing* and *preparatory farewells* are clear.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""tonight"" indicates high imminence.
    *   **Stated desire:** Clear desire to die, stated as an active plan.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""planning to kill myself tonight.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they are planning to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific *method* (like ""pills"" or ""gun"") is mentioned. However, a *plan* is explicitly stated (""planning to kill myself tonight""), and *preparations* are strongly implied/stated through the chosen timing (""Everyone is asleep. Everyone who could help me is asleep now."") and the farewell message (""Rest In Peace ya'll"" and the preceding lines). This goes beyond mere ideation into the realm of planning and preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A current/future intention (""tonight"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there's clear, explicit suicidal intent and a plan.
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because it includes more than just thoughts or desire; it explicitly states a ""plan"" and includes elements of preparation (choosing a time to avoid intervention, farewell messages).
    *   It fits 'Behavior' because it includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions... a plan to commit suicide... or preparations being taken."" The plan is to do it ""tonight"" when ""everyone is asleep,"" and the farewells are preparations.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past or recently initiated action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly mentions ""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing."" Also, ""I need to leave"" in this context implies leaving life. ""Make myself suffer extraordinary pain"" suggests self-punishment, but the immediate follow-up points to suicide as the ultimate form of this.
    - Emotional indicators: ""suffer extraordinary pain,"" ""don't belong here"" (hopelessness, despair, alienation).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are mentioned. The suffering is linked to past decisions, not past attempts.
    - Imminence: ""starting to think suicide is the only thing..."" indicates a current and developing thought process towards suicide. ""I need to leave"" suggests a current desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear statement that suicide is seen as the *only* solution to their pain, and a desire to ""leave"" because they ""don't belong here."" This indicates a genuine wish to die or not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide is the only thing...""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't belong here. I need to leave"" in the context of suicide.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively considering suicide as a solution.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there is a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, this points to 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current thought process (""starting to think"") and a current desire (""I need to leave"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire for suicide and suicidal thoughts (""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing,"" ""I need to leave""). This goes beyond general distress, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations being taken (e.g., ""how"" they would commit suicide, what tools, where). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed. The thought makes me so happy. Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy. I take great solace knowing that this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon. I'm saying this on reddit because if I were to share this with people in real life they'd try to stop me and I don't want anyone to take this away from me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""practicing hanging myself,"" ""finally do it,"" ""deserves to die,"" ""thinking of death,"" ""pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon."" The method is explicitly ""hanging myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""My life is fucked now,"" ""worthless trash,"" ""deserves to die,"" ""pain and this fucking shit life."" Also, ""The thought makes me so happy,"" ""Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy,"" ""I take great solace.""
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""practicing hanging myself,"" ""I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed."" This is a clear method and ongoing preparation.
    - References to past actions: ""I've been practicing hanging myself,"" ""practiced and there was no pain really."" These are described as preparatory actions, not a completed or interrupted attempt.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""will be over soon."" This indicates a future intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die and act on it: ""can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""deserves to die,"" ""I will succeed.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but the intent is clear through phrases like ""finally do it"" in the context of ""hanging myself"" and ""deserves to die.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, very clearly (""can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""deserves to die,"" ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon"").
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a strong desire to act on them and finds solace in the thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""hanging myself"" is a specific method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I've been practicing hanging myself,"" ""I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed."" This is explicit preparation and training for the act.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. If there is *any* mention of a method or preparation, it leans towards 'Behavior'. Here, there is a clear method and active preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past *preparatory actions* (""I've been practicing"") and a strong future intention to complete the act (""can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""I will succeed"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The ""practicing"" is explicitly described as training/preparation (""train myself to break this natural survival instinct""), not an initiated attempt to die. The phrase ""there was no pain really"" suggests testing, not an attempt to complete the act.
    - If a past action is described, was it a concrete suicidal act or just thinking about one? It was a concrete preparatory action, not an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It clearly mentions a specific method (""hanging myself"") and describes ongoing, active preparations and training for this method (""practicing hanging myself,"" ""keep practicing, train myself...and I will succeed""). This directly fits the definition of 'Behavior', which requires a plan, method, or preparations.
    - The ""practicing"" is described as preparation/training for a future act, not a past initiated, potentially lethal action that was an attempt. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.

Tonight it happened twice. the first time i screamed at her to shut up and the second time i screamed i would kill her and whipped a blanket at her. My mom was there and she said i scared her. I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about. I dont want to get into any relationships (not that i would anyway) because i can snap like this. I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them, to a clueless little dog. I want to die. I want to disappear. I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" and ""one day i will take myself away from here."" These are clear expressions of suicidal intent. No specific method or means is mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I know i'm a piece of shit,"" ""feel like absolute shit,"" ""I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them,"" ""I am on the edge."" These indicate severe self-loathing, despair, and being at a breaking point.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. There's no talk of pills, a gun, a specific location, or writing a note.
    - References to past actions: The post describes snapping at the dog ""tonight"" and screaming ""I would kill her"" (referring to the dog) and whipping a blanket. These are actions of anger, not past suicidal actions by the author.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here."" This indicates a current feeling of being ""on the edge"" and a future intention, possibly imminent (""tonight"") but definitely ""one day.""
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and genuine wish to die or end their life (""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I will take myself away from here"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" and ""take myself away from here"" are direct expressions of a desire to end one's life.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, unequivocally.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as personal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. This fits.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a recent event (snapping at the dog) that triggers current despair and a future intention to end their life.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The actions described are related to anger towards the dog, not a suicidal act by the author. The intention to ""take myself away from here"" is a future thought, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I will take myself away from here""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparations to carry out the suicidal thoughts. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action by the author. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' because it clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without any specific plan or past attempt.

I don't have any purpose in life to be honest. I don't know what will i do after college. I feel like disapointment. That's all. I just needed to vent. Sorry for my english.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish."" It also says ""I just don't want to exist.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""feel like trash,"" ""don't know what's wrong with me,"" ""don't know what to do anymore,"" ""draining me,"" ""anxiety attacks,"" ""don't have any purpose,"" ""feel like disapointment."" These indicate general distress, hopelessness, and lack of purpose.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means): None.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: None related to self-harm or suicide.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer states ""I just don't want to exist"" but immediately follows with ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish."" This is a clear negation of suicidal intent, even if they are expressing a desire for their current state of being to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" are mentioned, but the author explicitly states ""Im not suicidal or something.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" could imply a desire to not be alive. However, this is immediately and explicitly contradicted by the statement ""Im not suicidal or something."" The author is expressing distress and a wish for their current suffering to cease, but not a desire to commit suicide.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish."" This directly negates personal suicidal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and past circumstances (lockdown, studying). No past or current suicidal actions or intentions.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant general distress, hopelessness, and a desire for their current state to end (""don't want to exist"").
    - Crucially, the author explicitly states ""Im not suicidal or something"" and ""I think that suicide is selfish."" This directly negates any personal suicidal intent or desire to die by suicide.
    - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die."" This aligns perfectly with the post, as the author explicitly denies being suicidal despite expressing distress.
    - 'Ideation' requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" While ""I just don't want to exist"" is present, the immediate and strong negation (""Im not suicidal or something"") means there is no *clear, current, personal expression of suicidal intent* from the author.
    - 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are clearly not applicable as there are no plans, methods, preparations, or initiated actions.

Based on the explicit negation of suicidal intent, despite the expression of distress and a wish ""not to exist,"" the post best fits the 'Indicator' category.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."". (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness.

    *   Crucially, it describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past: ""I attempted suicide last week."" This aligns directly with the 'Attempt' definition.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation and a desire to die, which would typically fit 'Ideation'.
    *   However, the defining element is the explicit description of a *past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action*: ""I attempted suicide last week"" and ""my attempt had failed.""
    *   The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death... If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
    *   Since a concrete past attempt is explicitly stated, 'Attempt' is the most accurate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""kill you"", ""valium"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"", ""I just want this nightmare to end"" (despair, desire for cessation of suffering, fear of failure in a suicidal act).
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""valium"" is a specific substance/method. The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" implies an action of taking the substance has already occurred.
    - References to past actions: ""I haven't taken enough"" clearly indicates that the user has already ingested Valium with suicidal intent.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The action is ongoing or very recent.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: ""I just want this nightmare to end"" in the context of taking Valium to ""kill you"" indicates a clear desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill you"" (referring to self in the context of the question).
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want this nightmare to end"" in this context.
    - No negation of desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""valium"".
    - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" indicates that the act of taking the substance (preparation and initiation of the act) has already occurred.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a very recent or ongoing past action (""I haven't taken enough"" implies an action already initiated).
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""I haven't taken enough"" clearly describes the initiation of taking Valium with the intent to die. This is a concrete, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) or behavior (plan/preparation) because it explicitly states that a suicidal action (taking Valium) has already been initiated. The user is questioning if the *amount taken* is sufficient, indicating an ongoing or very recent attempt.
    - This fits the definition of 'Attempt' as it describes a ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death"".

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""I don't want to live at all,"" ""Some of these are suicide attempts."" It details specific methods for past attempts: ""swallowed every single one [Unisom sleeping pills],"" ""took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck,"" ""took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail."" It also mentions a ""suicide note.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't want to live at all,"" ""really made me scared, it's like I just don't die"" (despair, frustration with survival).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: For past actions, clear methods (pills, razor, cocktail) and preparations (buying pills, writing note, getting new blade) are described.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: The post is primarily a detailed recount of three distinct past ""suicide attempts"" that were initiated but did not result in death.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The opening line ""I don't want to live at all"" indicates current ideation, but the bulk of the post describes past actions.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear desire to die is expressed (""I don't want to live at all"") and reinforced by the frustration of surviving past incidents.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide attempts"" and ""suicide note.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die: ""I don't want to live at all.""
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they express a desire for death.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, specific methods (overdose, cutting) and means (Unisom, straight razor, various prescriptions) are described in relation to past suicidal acts. Preparations like buying pills and writing a note are also mentioned. While these are past, they are concrete details of initiated actions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both a current desire (""I don't want to live at all"") and multiple past, specific, potentially lethal actions.
    - Crucially, it describes specific, potentially lethal actions that were initiated in the past and failed: ""swallowed every single one,"" ""sliced hard and fast across my neck,"" ""took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail."" These are all concrete, self-initiated suicidal acts. The motorcycle incident is described as an accident, not an attempt, but the preceding descriptions are unequivocally attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly describes multiple past, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal and explicitly identified as ""suicide attempts."" This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'. Even though there is current ideation (""I don't want to live at all""), the detailed description of past initiated actions takes precedence for classification according to the provided rules (""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill myself,"" ""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it,"" ""I just need someone to push me one more inch.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""All failing,"" ""fucking everything up""), despair (""stressed out,"" ""crying""), physical pain (""feel my liver hurt,"" ""dull ache""), feeling overwhelmed.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight."" This describes a specific method (belt, doorknob) and location (closet) for a hanging.
    - References to past actions: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This is a description of a specific, initiated, potentially lethal action that was interrupted by the author.
    - Imminence: ""tonight,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it."" High imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/end it (""Tell me why I shouldn't kill myself,"" ""I'm ready to be done"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm ready to be done"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method and location are detailed: ""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet."" This describes a specific means for a suicidal act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a very recent past event: ""tonight.""
    - Crucially, it describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob... Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off."" This is a clear description of an initiated suicidal act that was interrupted by the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The presence of a description of a past or very recent *initiated action* that was potentially lethal (""I put a belt around my neck... Right before I passed out, I stopped"") directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'. Even though the action was interrupted, it was a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal act. While there is also strong current ideation and a detailed method mentioned (which would otherwise point to 'Behavior'), the *initiated action* described for ""tonight"" makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate category according to the definitions provided.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide"", ""tired of life"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""too tired of life"".
    - Specific plans, methods: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer states ""too scared to kill myself"" and then ""too tired of life."" This indicates a conflict. While they are tired of life, they explicitly state they are *too scared to act* on suicidal thoughts. The mention of suicide being illegal and fear of arrest/fine further reinforces a lack of current intent to act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The phrase ""too tired of life"" suggests a desire for an end to suffering, but this is immediately followed by ""too scared to kill myself,"" which explicitly negates a current personal desire to *act* on suicidal thoughts. The primary sentiment is distress and a conflict regarding the *idea* of suicide, rather than a clear, active intent to die by their own hand.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""too scared to kill myself"" directly states they do not want to act on the thought due to fear.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current emotional state and a current conflict regarding the idea of suicide. No past or future initiated action is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Attempt: No past or very recent initiated action.
    - Behavior: No plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
    - Ideation: While ""tired of life"" and the mention of ""kill myself"" are present, the explicit statement ""too scared to kill myself"" and the concern about legal repercussions if they fail indicate a *lack of current, personal desire to act* on suicidal thoughts. The definition of Ideation requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" Here, the desire to *act* is explicitly negated by fear.
    - Indicator: The post expresses general distress (""scared,"" ""too tired of life"") and discusses suicide abstractly (""kill myself,"" ""suicide"") but explicitly **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author** due to the ""too scared to kill myself"" and the legal concerns. This fits the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die."" The primary sentiment is distress about the situation and the *idea* of suicide, rather than a genuine current desire to act.

So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""end this bullshit for good"" strongly implies ending their life. ""We start dying the second we are born"" is a general statement but contributes to the overall despair.
    - Emotional indicators: Extreme despair, hopelessness, nihilism, anger (""Fuck this fucking world,"" ""This isn't fucking living,"" ""human life has no fucking purpose"").
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" This indicates a specific plan involving travel and a timeframe (April) to achieve the goal of ending their life. ""This will be my second to last post"" is a clear sign of preparation and finality.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""in April"" provides a specific future timeframe. ""This will be my second to last post"" suggests a very imminent action following this post.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""end this bullshit for good"" clearly expresses a desire to die or end their existence.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""end this bullshit for good"" is a clear expression of this desire in context.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is clearly planning to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? A ""trip"" is mentioned as part of the plan, implying a specific location or journey to facilitate the act. While the *exact* method isn't named, the *plan* (taking a trip) and *preparations* (""second to last post"") are clearly present.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""This will be my second to last post"" is a very strong sign of preparation and final communication. ""taking a trip in April"" is also a planned action.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. If there is *any* mention of a method or preparation, it leans towards 'Behavior'. Here, there's a clear desire to die and explicit mentions of a plan (""taking a trip"") and preparation (""second to last post"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention and plan (""I'm taking a trip in April,"" ""This will be my second to last post"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes a future plan, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""end this bullshit for good""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere ideation by explicitly mentioning a plan (""taking a trip in April"") and preparations (""This will be my second to last post""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken.""
    - It does not describe a past initiated attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The post expresses a wish to die: ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""no body cares,"" ""no motivation,"" ""fucked myself over,"" ""no one left to turn to,"" ""don't feel like anything anymore it's just blank."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, isolation, and anhedonia.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"" are specific methods of dying being considered or wished for. There are no signs of preparation.
    - Past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The phrasing ""i just wish"" indicates a current desire/thought, not an immediate plan or past action.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to die, expressed through the wish for specific lethal outcomes.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"" clearly expresses a desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as a personal wish.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"" are specific methods.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - The presence of specific methods (""od on meds,"" ""get hit by a car"") moves this towards 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation', even if phrased as a wish rather than a concrete plan. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a specific method.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current wish/desire.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's a wish for a method, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, as it expresses a clear personal desire to die (""i just wish i could...""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It includes not just a general desire to die, but also mentions specific methods (""get hit by a car,"" ""od on meds""). This presence of specific methods, even in the context of a wish, aligns with the 'Behavior' definition (""AND also mentions... a specific method""). The ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'"" rule is considered, but ""od on meds"" is a sufficiently explicit method.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated action*, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the presence of explicit desire to die *and* specific methods points to 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No direct mentions of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" ""self-harm,"" or specific methods/means. The phrase ""I would fucking jump out of bed"" is not related to suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: The post expresses extreme despair, hopelessness, and a feeling of being unwanted (""daily torture of living life,"" ""Being unwanted in literally all facets of life""). The author describes their life as ""torture"" and expresses a profound wish to have been born differently (""I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: None.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer describes the profound suffering of their existence. While they express deep despair and a wish for their life circumstances to be fundamentally different, they do not explicitly state a desire to die or not be alive. The focus is on the ""torture of living"" and the unfairness of their situation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, it does not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't here,"" or similar phrases. It expresses extreme suffering *while living*.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, ongoing state of profound suffering.
    - Crucially, does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses profound distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being unwanted and tortured by their existence (""daily torture of living life""). This is clearly more than just general sadness.
    - However, the post *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author*. It describes the *pain of living* but does not explicitly state a desire to end that life. There are no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't here,"" or ""I'm going to end it all.""
    - According to the definitions:
        - 'Indicator' definition: ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" ""Vague feelings about dying or death, or very general dissatisfaction with life, fall here if suicidal intent isn't explicit. **If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.**""
        - 'Ideation' definition: ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    - While the level of despair is very high, the critical component of an *explicit desire to die* is missing. The author is expressing the torture of their current existence, not an explicit intent to end it. Given the instruction to choose 'Indicator' if there's ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, this fits 'Indicator'.
    - There is no plan or method, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no past initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.

Final decision leans towards 'Indicator' due to the absence of an explicit desire to die, despite the intense suffering described. The post focuses on the *pain of living* rather than an explicit intent to die.

    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, not for *current* intent. The post refers to *past* attempts but does not detail methods.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for *current* intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" It also describes a current state of being ""suicidal"" (as a general characteristic) and frustration, but the concrete action mentioned is in the past.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" clearly indicates multiple past initiated, potentially lethal actions.
    *   If a past action is described, was it a concrete suicidal act or just thinking about one? It was a concrete suicidal act (""tried to kill myself"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The core of the post is the statement ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The fact that it happened ""8 times"" reinforces this.
    *   Even though the post also mentions ""me being suicidal"" (which could imply current ideation), the explicit description of past initiated actions takes precedence as per the 'Attempt' definition: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""

103,bruh. they always say if something/someone makes you sad then you're better off without them right? but when i say i'm better off dead everyone's like no don't do that :D,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""I'm better off dead"" is a direct expression of a desire for death.
    - Emotional indicators: Implied sadness (""makes you sad""). The "":D"" emoticon might suggest a casual or sarcastic tone, but the core statement remains.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not specified, but the statement reflects a current personal sentiment.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer states ""I'm better off dead,"" which is a clear personal desire to die. It's not framed as an unwanted thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? While not ""kill myself,"" ""I'm better off dead"" is a direct and explicit personal expression of a desire for death.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm better off dead"" clearly conveys this.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is expressing the thought as their own sentiment, not as an unwanted intrusion.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current personal intention/feeling (""I'm better off dead"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""I'm better off dead""). This rules out 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' lacks such a clear personal desire.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes an ""explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer,"" without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""overdose,"" ""took 44 paracetamol,"" ""survive an od.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""sorry,"" ""don't know where else to post,"" ""stomach is hurting very badly,"" ""sweating badly and shaking too,"" ""feel like a burden.""
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: The post describes an action that *has already occurred*: ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago."" This is a specific method and act.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago."" This is a clear, initiated action.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The action was ""almost an hour ago,"" indicating a very recent, completed act.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: ""i dont think i want to die but something is stopping me cllng 999."" This indicates ambivalence *after* the act, and a struggle to seek help, but the act itself was initiated. The question ""could i survive an od like this or do i need to call emergency services?"" indicates concern for survival.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""overdose"" and taking a large quantity of pills strongly implies it.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The phrase ""i dont think i want to die"" suggests a current lack of desire, but the *action* taken (taking 44 paracetamol) is a suicidal act. The category 'Attempt' focuses on the *action* itself.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states they ""don't think I want to die"" *after* the action, and is asking for help, which indicates a desire to survive the consequences of the initiated act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""44 paracetamol"" and ""overdose.""
    - Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills is the execution of a method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *past event* (""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"") and current physical symptoms and distress, along with a question about survival.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" is a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly describes a ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated action by the author that was potentially lethal."" The phrase ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" perfectly fits the definition of an 'Attempt'. The subsequent ambivalence or desire to survive does not change the classification of the *initiated action*. This is a clear description of an overdose that has already occurred.

105,"I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Key elements: ""I want to end it"" is a clear expression of suicidal intent/desire to die.
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: Explicitly states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" indicating no plan, method, or preparation.
    - Past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence: Not specified due to ""no idea how, when.""
    - Stated desire: Clear desire to die/end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? ""I want to end it"" is a direct and clear expression of a desire for self-termination. (Yes)
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to end it"" clearly indicates this. (Yes)
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as personal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. The post explicitly states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else.""
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I want to end it""). This rules out 'Indicator' which lacks clear personal intent.
    - The post explicitly states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" meaning there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. This distinction places it squarely in 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit as it captures the explicit suicidal thoughts/desire without a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""sick and tired,"" ""can't handle it anymore,"" ""feel like a robot,"" ""feel nothing and like I'm overloading,"" ""exhausted,"" ""completely hopeless."" These indicate severe distress, anhedonia, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: Refers to being in the ""exact same situation"" as a year ago, indicating a chronic struggle, but not a past suicidal action.
    - Imminence: ""I really can't handle it anymore"" expresses current overwhelm, but not immediate suicidal intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses profound distress, exhaustion, and a desire for support (""I just want someone to care about me or to listen""). There is no explicit statement of wanting to die or end their life. The phrase ""I don't know what to do with myself"" is an expression of feeling lost, not suicidal intent. ""my jackass of a brain doesn't want to allow it"" refers to an internal struggle with their own mind, not a desire for death.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses extreme emotional pain, exhaustion, and hopelessness, but does not state a desire to die or not be alive.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of severe distress and a feeling of being stuck in a cycle. It references a past period of similar distress.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly indicates significant distress, hopelessness, and being overwhelmed.
    - However, it *lacks* any explicit personal expression of a desire to die or suicidal intent. Phrases like ""I really can't handle it anymore"" or ""I don't know what to do with myself"" convey distress and being overwhelmed, but not a direct wish for death.
    - There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - Based on the definitions, the post expresses general distress and hopelessness without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. This fits the 'Indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post mentions ""once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death."" This is a general, almost philosophical statement about hitting rock bottom, not a personal expression of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""lonely and lost as ever,"" ""really bad bipolar tendencies,"" ""scares me sometimes bc ion wan be that person,"" ""bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns"" (past). However, it also states ""i'm in therapy again btw so it might get better for me,"" ""i've been overall better compared to the rest of my life,"" ""i feel more like myself,"" and ""starting to accept who i am."" The overall tone is one of improvement and hope.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""my rock bottom was having really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday for nearly 2 years."" This describes a difficult period but not a suicidal action.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No intentions of self-harm or suicide are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire to improve (""it might get better for me""), acceptance of self (""starting to accept who i am""), and offers positive encouragement to others (""always a way to improve on something even if your at rock bottom,"" ""please find a way to stay positive and stay safe""). There is no stated desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""nothing lower but death"" is a general observation, not a personal desire. The writer is actively seeking therapy and expressing improvement.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not expressed as personal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past struggles and current feelings, but also current improvement and future hope.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The ""rock bottom"" description does not include any suicidal actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress and past struggles, but there is no clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.
    - The mention of ""death"" is a general statement about hitting rock bottom, not a personal wish.
    - The overall tone is one of coping, improvement, and even offering support to others.
    - There are no plans, methods, or past initiated actions related to suicide.
    - This fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and discusses death abstractly without a clear personal desire to die.

    *   **Imminence:** ""soon,"" ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon."" Indicates a current intention for the near future.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to ""end it.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""plan on ending it soon"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""plan on ending it soon.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is expressing a plan to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" is a specific method and substance, described as ""my go-to plan.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation (like writing a note or acquiring pills), but the identification of a specific method and ""go-to plan"" is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""plan on ending it soon,"" ""toning or this week"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes a future plan, not a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""plan on ending it soon""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by specifying a method and calling it a ""go-to plan"" (""overdosibg on ibuprofen... thats likely my go-to plan""). This constitutes a plan/method, moving it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    *   The post describes a future plan, not a past initiated action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific method/plan fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""I'd kill myself"" and mentions a specific means/method: ""If I had a gun"".
    - **Emotional indicators:** ""feel like shit"", ""not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future"", ""fucked up"". These indicate despair, hopelessness, and a sense of being trapped.
    - **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** A specific method (""gun"") is mentioned in relation to the suicidal intent, even if conditionally (""If I had a gun""). No preparations are mentioned.
    - **References to past actions:** The post mentions a relapse in addiction, but not a past suicidal action/attempt.
    - **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire is present ""right now"", although the full intensity of future feelings is anticipated. The suicidal statement is a present desire.
    - **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, explicit desire to die (""I'd kill myself"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"".
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    - No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them. The desire is stated as a direct consequence if the means were available.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""gun"") is mentioned as the desired means for carrying out the suicidal act. While conditional (""If I had a gun""), it identifies a specific tool/method.
    - No signs of preparation.
    - The mention of a specific method, even if conditional, differentiates this from pure ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current state of mind and a current desire (""right now I'm not feeling...""). The suicidal intent is current.
    - It does not describe a past or very recent *initiated* potentially lethal action. It describes a past relapse in addiction, but not a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The explicit desire to die (""I'd kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The mention of a specific method (""gun""), even if conditional, moves this beyond simple 'Ideation'. The 'Behavior' definition includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" The mention of ""gun"" fits the ""specific method"" criterion.
    - There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with the mention of a specific method points to 'Behavior'.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Based on the clear desire to die but absence of a plan/method/preparation, this points towards 'Ideation'.

    - Are there signs of preparation? ""My last time posting on this account"" and ""Goodbye reddit"" can be interpreted as farewells/preparations.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A future intention (""plan on doing it next week"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes a future plan, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit suicidal intent and a desire to die.
    - Not 'Ideation' because the post goes beyond just thoughts and desire; it explicitly states the existence of a ""suicide plan"" that has been thought over and is believed to work. This presence of a plan moves it to 'Behavior'.
    - Not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent initiated action is described. The post is about a future plan.
    - The post fits 'Behavior' because it contains explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"", ""worthless existence"") AND explicitly mentions having a ""suicide plan"" and a timeline for it (""next week""), along with farewells (""Goodbye reddit""). This clearly meets the criteria for 'Behavior' which includes ""a plan to commit suicide"".

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""suicidal thoughts"" (current and past), ""attempted suicide in the past"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""Feeling bad,"" ""depression,"" ""pain,"" ""feel terrible,"" ""feel like a piece of crap.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for current intent.
    - References to past actions: ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This is a clear, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: No imminent intentions to act are stated. The post is about seeking help.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is expressing distress about current ""suicidal thoughts"" but is actively seeking help (""told my wife that I need help,"" ""set up appointments,"" ""going to try""). There is no stated current desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""attempted suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, the post expresses distress about having ""those thoughts again"" and the process of seeking help. The overall tone is one of struggle and a desire to get help, not a desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? While not explicitly stated, the act of ""seeking help"" and ""setting up appointments"" strongly implies a desire to manage or overcome these thoughts, rather than act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, not for current intent.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for current intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""attempted suicide in the past""), current struggles (""begun having those thoughts again""), and future intentions related to seeking help (""set up appointments,"" ""going to try"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? Yes, ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This is a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""
    - Although there are current ""suicidal thoughts,"" the presence of a clearly described past attempt is the strongest indicator and takes precedence according to the rules (""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described"").
    - There is no current explicit desire to die or a current plan/method, which would differentiate it from 'Ideation' or 'Behavior' if the past attempt wasn't present. The focus is on seeking help for the current struggles.

It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) and ""I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best."" This indicates a history or inclination towards self-harm as a coping mechanism. There are no direct mentions of suicide, death, or specific methods for suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""can't socialize well,"" ""suffering,"" ""afraid he won't want baggage like me,"" ""go insane,"" ""so many issues,"" ""depression,"" ""too much."" These are strong indicators of distress, hopelessness, and feeling like a burden.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for suicide. The mention of cutting is in the context of an *unavailable* coping mechanism, not a current plan for suicide.
    - References to past actions: ""thoughts of sh"" suggests past self-harm ideation or actions. ""I can't even cut"" implies cutting has been a past coping mechanism. These refer to self-harm, not a suicide attempt.
    - Imminence: ""It's getting to be too much"" suggests escalating distress but no immediate suicidal intent or plan.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses profound distress, fear of abandonment, and an inability to cope or express their feelings. There is *no explicit desire to die or commit suicide*. The focus is on suffering and the inability to cope.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The distress is about current life circumstances, social anxiety, fear of losing their relationship, and the inability to use their preferred coping mechanism (self-harm).
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned. ""Thoughts of sh"" are mentioned, which refers to self-harm, not necessarily suicide. The inability to cut is presented as a problem because it's their ""best"" coping mechanism, not because they are trying to avoid a suicidal act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - The mention of ""cutting"" is related to self-harm as a coping mechanism, not a suicidal plan or method. There is no indication of a plan to *end their life*.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current emotional suffering, past ""thoughts of sh,"" and the current inability to use cutting as a coping mechanism.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The ""thoughts of sh"" and ""can't even cut"" refer to self-harm, not a suicide attempt. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Attempt:** No description of a past or very recent initiated potentially lethal action.
    - **Behavior:** No explicit suicidal thoughts *with* a plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The mention of ""cutting"" is related to self-harm as a coping mechanism, not a suicidal plan.
    - **Ideation:** The post does *not* include explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive. While there is deep distress and mention of ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm), this does not equate to a personal desire to die or suicidal intent. The primary sentiment is suffering, fear, and inability to cope.
    - **Indicator:** The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and discusses self-harm as a coping mechanism. It lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The distress is high, and self-harm is a risk factor, but direct suicidal intent is absent. The rule states: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" In this case, there is no ambiguity; a genuine suicidal desire is not expressed.

Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate classification.

114,"Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over. If you really loved me, you'd want me to be happy. The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""when I die,"" ""if I'm dead.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""pain is finally over,"" ""happy"" (in the context of death). This indicates a desire for death as an escape from suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated as immediate, but expresses a strong desire for a future state of being dead.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear and explicit desire for death as the only way to find happiness and end pain (""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly, but the phrases ""when I die"" and ""if I'm dead"" clearly refer to the author's own desired death.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, unequivocally: ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."" This is a strong personal expression of a desire for death.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; death is presented as the desired outcome to end suffering.
    - Conclusion: There is a clear, personal desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Conclusion: No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. This rules out 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a desired future state (""when I die,"" ""if I'm dead"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. It does not describe an initiated action or attempt.
    - Conclusion: No past or recent initiated action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead"") and thoughts about death as an escape from pain.
    - It does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation.
    - It does not describe a past or very recent initiated action.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""kill myself"", ""don't want to live"", ""goodbye"". ""Take the leap"" is a metaphorical phrase for making a big decision, here applied to suicide, but it does not specify a concrete method like jumping from a height.
    - Emotional indicators: ""don't care about anything anymore"", ""life is all downhill"", ""career dreams are ruined"", ""never have kids"", ""nothing in my life"". These clearly indicate hopelessness and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned. However, ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"" indicates a firm decision to act. The word ""goodbye"" is a clear preparation or farewell, suggesting imminent action.
    - References to past actions: ""you guys helped me stay here about a month longer"" refers to past support, not a past suicidal action or attempt.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""finally decided"", ""goodbye"" strongly suggest current and imminent intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and explicit desire to die and end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to live"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states a decision to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method (e.g., ""pills"", ""gun"", ""bridge"") is mentioned. ""Take the leap"" is a metaphor for the decision, not a method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""goodbye"" is a clear sign of preparation/farewell. The phrase ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"" indicates a firm decision to act, which is a step beyond mere ideation and implies a plan is in motion, even if the specifics are not detailed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention based on a recent decision (""I finally decided"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. This is not a description of a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses explicit personal suicidal intent and a desire to die (""kill myself"", ""don't want to live""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The distinction between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' rests on the presence of a specific plan, method, or preparations. While a specific *method* is not named, the post states a firm *decision* to act (""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"") and includes a clear *preparation* in the form of a farewell (""goodbye""). The ""goodbye"" indicates a concrete step being taken in preparation for the act. Therefore, it goes beyond mere thoughts or desires (Ideation) and enters the realm of planning/preparation (Behavior).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""it's finally ending"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"". These are strong euphemisms for suicide. No specific method is mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""relaxed that it's finally ending"" (acceptance, relief), ""Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)"" (farewell).
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jump) or location. However, ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" and ""Goodbye"" are very strong indicators of preparation or final acts before an imminent suicidal action. The ""one last time"" suggests a final ritual, and ""Goodbye"" is a clear farewell.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""one last time before i end it all"", ""before i call it quits"" indicates high imminence.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: A clear, personal desire to die is expressed (""relaxed that it's finally ending"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but the euphemisms are very clear in their intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, absolutely (""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""relaxed that it's finally ending"", ""enough for me"").
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses acceptance and even relaxation about the impending end.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No explicit method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" and ""Goodbye"" are strong signs of preparation and final farewells, indicating that the person is preparing for an imminent act. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations being taken"" and ""giving things away"" (which ""Goodbye"" can be seen as a form of).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A current/future intention (""before i end it all"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The post includes clear signs of preparation and a final farewell (""one last time"", ""Goodbye""), indicating actions being taken *before* the act, even if a specific method isn't named. This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' (thoughts/desire without plan/preparation) into 'Behavior'.
    - The post does not describe a past initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The combination of clear suicidal intent and explicit preparations/final acts (playing a game ""one last time"", saying ""Goodbye"") fits the 'Behavior' definition, which includes ""preparations being taken.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""she had tried to kill herself"" (referring to a friend).
    - Emotional indicators: ""I need help,"" ""I'm scared."" These indicate distress from the author.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the author for themselves. The reference to an attempt is about a friend.
    - References to past actions: Yes, a friend ""tried to kill herself."" This is not an action by the author.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: Not applicable to the author.
    - Writer's stated desire: The author expresses concern and fear *for their friend*, and asks for advice on how to help or know if the friend is okay. There is no stated desire to die or suicidal intent from the author themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""tried to kill herself,"" but this refers to a third party (the friend), not the author.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, the author expresses concern for someone else.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as the author is not expressing personal suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, not by the author for themselves.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No, not by the author for themselves.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""she had tried to kill herself"") involving a friend.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, for the friend, but not for the author. The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The author is expressing distress (""I need help,"" ""I'm scared"") and seeking advice, but this distress is explicitly related to concern for a friend who has attempted suicide, not about their own suicidal thoughts or intentions.
    - The post *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.*

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I will hang myself now,"" ""kill me with it,"" ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore."" The method ""hang myself"" is explicit.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't want to be alone anymore,"" ""sick,"" ""scared to go out,"" ""nobody has ever liked me,"" ""made fun of me and used me."" These indicate severe despair, isolation, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""I will hang myself now."" This is a clear statement of intent and method. ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it"" explicitly states active preparation (searching for means).
    - References to past actions: ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" indicates past self-harm, but not a past suicide *attempt*.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""now,"" ""I will hang myself now,"" ""I'm now looking for."" This indicates immediate intent.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a genuine and explicit wish to die (""I will hang myself now,"" ""kill me"").

    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie."" This is an active step of preparation.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die *and* a specific method/preparation mentioned, this leans towards 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""I will hang myself now,"" ""I'm now looking for""). It also mentions past self-harm, but this is not a past *suicide attempt*.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes an *imminent plan and active preparation*, not an initiated past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent and desire to die (""I will hang myself now,"" ""kill me""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond just expressing suicidal thoughts/desire by explicitly mentioning a specific method (""hang myself"") and active preparation (""looking for something that I can tie""). This rules out 'Ideation'.
    - It describes a current, imminent plan and preparation, not a past initiated action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

    - This directly aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die.""
    - It does not express a personal desire to die or suicidal intent, so it's not 'Ideation'.
    - It does not mention any plan, method, or preparation, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe any past initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.

People could say stuff like: well, start your own company. you don't get it. I want out now. In the beginning I thought: well, I should just work harder and I kept up with my work through self research because they don't have time. Well, how did they thank me? By giving me more. I can't handle it and when I say something about it, they respond with: well, the works keep coming. yeah, it is not my fault they organized themselves like trash. I am a hard worker but now I just don't see the need. Tf is this life? I want out.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I just want to kill myself."" and ""I want out."" (repeated twice, implying desire to end life).
    - Emotional indicators: ""Hate this rat race,"" ""overwork me,"" ""can't handle it,"" ""don't see the need,"" ""Tf is this life?"" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and feeling overwhelmed.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    - Imminence: ""now"" suggests current desire.
    - Asses the writer's stated desire: There is a clear and explicit wish to die (""I just want to kill myself,"" ""I want out"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I just want to kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to kill myself,"" and ""I want out"" in context of despair.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as personal and current.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire (""I just want to kill myself,"" ""I want out now"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit personal expression of suicidal intent (""I just want to kill myself"") and a desire to not be alive (""I want out""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation to carry out suicide. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

121,"Are we going? AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE. It's the truth, you choose to not face the reality of the situation. You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames. Let the world know that you considered yourself normal, it is the world that wronged you and the world is wrong, not you. With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem and it's not even funny.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (misspelling of die), ""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicidal courage and determination to get on with it"", ""If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""DEPRESSED"", ""frightened"", ""coward"", ""Everyone hates themselves"".
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem"", ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also. Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best."" These are highly specific, dangerous methods and preparatory steps.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The initial ""I WANT TO DOIE"" is current. The detailed methods are presented as a potential future course of action (""If you change your mind and you want to do it"").
    - Writer's stated desire: The post starts with a clear personal desire ""I WANT TO DOIE"". While there's a contradictory statement (""You will never do it""), the subsequent detailed instructions for a violent, self-destructive act, framed as ""going out with a bang"" if the desire to ""do it"" (die) solidifies, indicates a strong connection to suicidal intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I WANT TO DOIE"" and ""suicidal thoughts"", and ""If you change your mind and you want to do it"" clearly refers to suicide.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I WANT TO DOIE"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The post states ""even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction... You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward"". This suggests a struggle or self-doubt about acting. However, this is immediately followed by detailed instructions on *how* to act if one *does* decide to ""do it,"" which overrides the previous statement of inaction. The initial ""I WANT TO DOIE"" is a direct personal expression.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes. ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"" for ""mayhem"" (in context of ""go out with a bang""), ""make nitroglycerin at home,"" ""research where to find the parts for cheap,"" ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best."" These are very specific and dangerous methods and locations.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""research where to find the parts for cheap,"" ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire (""I WANT TO DOIE"") and detailed plans for a potential future action (""If you change your mind and you want to do it"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I WANT TO DOIE""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - Crucially, it provides highly specific and dangerous methods (""make nitroglycerin at home,"" ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"") and preparatory steps (""research where to find the parts for cheap,"" ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants"") for a potentially lethal act, even if presented conditionally (""If you change your mind and you want to do it""). This level of detail and instruction for a specific, dangerous action, directly following an expression of suicidal desire, fits the definition of 'Behavior'. It's not just thinking about a plan; it's outlining how to execute a very dangerous one.

122,"Bully payback help. My best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesn't even know. Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. It's mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!. With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post contains the phrase ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself"" and ""when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you."" However, these are direct quotes from the bully *to the friend*, not expressions of suicidal intent from the author or the friend themselves.
    - Emotional indicators: The friend is described as ""mentally disturbing,"" ""constantly tired,"" ""won't eat,"" ""isn't doing well,"" ""really overwhelmed."" These indicate severe distress and potential mental health impact, but not explicitly suicidal despair from the author or the friend.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned for the author or the friend.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide or self-harm for the author or the friend.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The author's desire is to help their friend and seek ""justice"" against the bully. There is no stated desire to die from the author. The friend's state is described as distressed, but not as having a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, but only as a quote from the bully directed at the friend, not as an expression of the author's or friend's own intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, neither from the author nor explicitly attributed to the friend. The friend is described as struggling and overwhelmed, but not as wanting to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as the suicidal language is external (from the bully).
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. This aligns with the analysis.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes an ongoing bullying situation and the friend's current state of distress.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post highlights severe distress experienced by the friend due to bullying. The author is expressing concern and seeking help for the friend.
    - The mention of ""go kill yourself"" is a threat/command from the bully, not an internal expression of suicidal intent from the author or the friend.
    - While the friend is clearly suffering (""mentally disturbing,"" ""constantly tired,"" ""isn't doing well""), the post does not explicitly state that the friend has suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. It describes general distress and withdrawal.
    - There is no mention of any plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
    - There is no description of a past or recent suicidal action.
    - Given the lack of explicit personal suicidal intent or desire from the author or explicitly attributed to the friend, and the presence of general distress, the 'Indicator' category is the most appropriate. The rule ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator"" applies here, as there is no clear genuine suicidal desire expressed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""I want to hang myself so bad,"" ""how much longer I could last here on earth.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing to look forward to,"" ""don't know how much longer I could last""), despair (""feel so alone,"" ""people don't get my pain""), self-deprecation (""loser, ugly, no motivation, isolated,"" ""Alot of mental illness"").
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""I want to hang myself so bad"" explicitly states a method (hanging).
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""holding on a bit,"" ""don't know how much longer I could last here on earth"" indicates a current struggle with potential future action.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to die (""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself,"" ""I want to hang myself so bad""), despite a small piece of hope.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes (""kill myself,"" ""suicide"").
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to hang myself so bad,"" ""how much longer I could last here on earth"").
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is present, although there's a struggle with a small piece of hope. The primary sentiment is a desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""I want to hang myself so bad"" clearly states a specific method (hanging).
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations are mentioned, but the desire for a specific method is present.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. If there is *any* mention of a method or preparation, it leans towards 'Behavior'. The mention of ""hang myself"" constitutes a method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""I want to hang myself,"" ""how much longer I could last"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes a desire and a method, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses explicit personal suicidal intent and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere ideation by specifying a method (""hang myself""), which falls under the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""still alive unfortunately"", ""I attempted once again"", ""still want to attempt again"". The word ""attempted"" directly refers to a suicidal act.
    - Emotional indicators: ""unfortunately"" (implies desire not to be alive), ""still want to attempt again"" (indicates ongoing suicidal desire).
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a *current* or *future* attempt. The past attempts are mentioned without specific methods.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: ""last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time?"". This is a clear description of a past, initiated, potentially lethal action.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The past attempt was ""last night"". The current desire (""still want to attempt again"") is present but not tied to an immediate plan.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear wish to die/act on suicidal thoughts (""still alive unfortunately"", ""still want to attempt again""), despite finding ""one thing to live for"" which introduces ambivalence.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""attempted"" is a direct reference to a suicidal act.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""still alive unfortunately"" and ""still want to attempt again.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to attempt is stated as current, though there's an element of ambivalence.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, not for a *current* or *future* act. The past attempts are mentioned without method details.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. It describes a past attempt (""last night I attempted once again"") and current suicidal ideation/desire (""still want to attempt again"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""last night I attempted once again"" clearly describes a concrete, initiated suicidal act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""last night I attempted once again"". This directly meets the definition of 'Attempt' which covers ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death"".
    - The rule states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" This applies here, as a past attempt is clearly described (""last night I attempted"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post uses phrases like ""end of my rope,"" ""go all the way through"" (implying a suicidal act), and ""I hope I don't wake up"" (clear desire to die). It describes physical sensations (""breath slowing down,"" ""chest hurting,"" ""falling asleep"") and the expectation of ""waking up later,"" which strongly implies an ingestion of a substance leading to unconsciousness (e.g., overdose).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""Everything's crumbling and I don't see a reason""), despair, sadness (""I'm sad right now""), fear (""I'm scared right now,"" ""too scared to go all the way through""), and isolation (""I'm alone,"" ""I can't reach out"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** While no specific substance is named, the description of ""falling asleep"" and ""waking up"" combined with physical symptoms is a very strong implicit indication of a method (ingestion of a substance).
    *   **References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed:** ""I know this is going to be another failure"" implies previous initiated but failed attempts. Crucially, ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" explicitly states a past *initiated action* that led to falling asleep and waking up, which fits the definition of a failed or interrupted attempt.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""right now,"" ""I can feel myself falling asleep"" indicates a current or very recent action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"" is a clear desire to die. The struggle (""still too scared to go all the way through"") indicates a desire to die but an internal conflict with completing the act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" And the context of ""go all the way through"" strongly implies a suicidal act.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to die is present, despite the fear of completing the act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, the physical sensations (""breath slowing down,"" ""chest hurting"") and the expectation of ""falling asleep"" and then ""waking up"" (based on past experience) strongly imply an ingestion of a substance (e.g., an overdose). This is more than just a thought; it's a description of the *process* of an initiated act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *current* physical state that suggests an action is underway (""I can feel myself falling asleep"") and explicitly refers to *past initiated actions* that resulted in ""waking up"" after ""falling asleep"" (""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up""). The phrase ""I know this is going to be another failure"" also points to past initiated actions that did not result in death.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes. The phrases ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" and ""I know this is going to be another failure"" clearly describe past *initiated actions* that were potentially lethal but failed. The current description of ""falling asleep"" suggests a current, similar action is also underway.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear desire to die (""I hope I don't wake up""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by describing physical sensations consistent with an *initiated* action (e.g., overdose) and, more importantly, explicitly references *past initiated actions* that fit the definition of an attempt (""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up,"" ""another failure"").
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' specifically includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" This post perfectly aligns with that, describing past actions that were initiated and failed, and a current state that mirrors these actions.

    - The post describes a current/future intention to act (""It's time,"" ""I am going to shoot myself"").
    - It explicitly states that past intent (""intent to kill myself"") ""never did it,"" meaning no past action was initiated. Therefore, it does not describe a past or very recent *initiated action*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""I am going to shoot myself,"" ""intent to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It also includes a specific method (""loaded gun,"" ""shoot myself"") and clear preparations (""accounts deleted,"" ""room empty,"" ""goodbye""). This rules out 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method/preparations).
    - The post describes a current, imminent plan to act, not a past initiated action. The statement ""I never did it"" confirms no past attempt was made. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the presence of explicit intent, a specific method, and preparations for a current/future act, the post falls squarely into the 'Behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""suicide episode,"" ""leave a note for my parents saying its my last time with them,"" ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it,"" ""I thought that was the last breath i have.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""depression,"" ""stress,"" ""feeling unappreciated,"" ""cry at midnight.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""leave a note,"" ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it.""
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: The entire narrative describes an event ""a week ago"" where the author ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it"" and ""luckily i vomited."" This is a clear description of an initiated, potentially lethal action.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: The action described was in the past (""a week ago""). The current state is ""a little okay now but its still in there.""
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: At the time of the event, there was a clear desire to die (""I thought that was the last breath i have"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide episode,"" and the actions described (leaving a note, swallowing bleach) clearly indicate suicidal intent at the time of the event.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, at the time of the described event.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""bleach"" and ""swallowed it.""
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""leave a note for my parents.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""a week ago"") and touches on current feelings (""a little okay now but its still in there"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it... luckily i vomited."" This is a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that was interrupted/failed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it"") that fits the definition of an 'Attempt'. The fact that it was ""a week ago"" and ""luckily i vomited"" confirms it was an initiated action that did not result in death. The presence of a note further supports the intent behind the action. The category 'Attempt' specifically covers such past or very recent initiated actions. Even though the author states they are ""a little okay now,"" the primary content and the most severe risk described is the past attempt.

128,"The only reason I'm alive is cause my parents are still alive. Long story short, I lost my sibling this year and ever since my anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse.

I thought I was getting better and moving on but I realise when I stop doing everything and sit alone, I still want to die. The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child :/ please help",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""lost all will to live,"" ""I still want to die."" No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse,"" ""lost all will to live,"" ""I still want to die,"" ""please help."" These indicate despair, hopelessness, and a desire to not be alive.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""I lost my sibling this year,"" ""After the funeral,"" ""I tried to pull through."" These refer to past life events and coping attempts, not past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: The statement ""I still want to die"" indicates a current desire. No specific timeline like ""tonight"" or ""soon"" is given.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die (""I still want to die""). The thought of parents is a protective factor, but does not negate the underlying desire.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""lost all will to live,"" and ""I still want to die"" clearly express a desire to not be alive.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as personal and current (""I still want to die""). While there's a reason they haven't acted (parents), the desire itself is present.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past events (sibling loss) leading to a current desire (""I still want to die"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The past actions described are coping efforts (""tried to pull through"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I still want to die"") and ""lost all will to live."" This moves it beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The explicit personal desire to die (""I still want to die"") makes it stronger than 'Indicator'.

I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thinking of suicide for months on end,"" ""my end will only get nearer.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""deeper than I've ever been,"" ""darkest corners,"" ""fine with either outcome"" (regarding the acid working or not, and the subsequent ""end getting nearer,"" indicating apathy or acceptance of death).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The ""acid"" is presented as a potential way to *avoid* suicide or a last resort to improve mental state, not as a suicidal method. The phrase ""my end will only get nearer"" is a statement of potential outcome, not a concrete plan.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are described.
    - Imminence: ""for months on end"" indicates ongoing thoughts. ""my end will only get nearer"" suggests a future possibility, but not an immediate, concrete plan.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end"" and expresses an acceptance or indifference towards ""my end will only get nearer."" This indicates a personal desire or acceptance of suicidal thoughts/outcome.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""thinking of suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive through the acceptance of ""my end will only get nearer"" and being ""fine with either outcome"" in that context.
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them; rather, they describe them as ongoing and accept the potential outcome.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied *for a suicidal act*. The acid is a coping mechanism.
    - No signs of preparation for suicide are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes ongoing ""thinking of suicide"" (current/past ideation) and a conditional future intention (""if it doesn't, my end will only get nearer"").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses ""thinking of suicide"" and an acceptance of death (""my end will only get nearer,"" ""fine with either outcome""). This goes beyond general distress and indicates explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for carrying out suicide. The acid is a coping mechanism, not a suicidal method. The ""end getting nearer"" is a vague future outcome, not a concrete plan. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No explicit mentions of these.
    - Emotional indicators: ""hit a new low tonight,"" ""haven't felt ok in a while,"" ""not sure what to do."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and being overwhelmed.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: The post mentions stealing and consuming ""my dog's prescription hydrocodone"" and having ""a bit to drink."" However, the stated purpose for this action is ""just to feel ok for one night,"" not to end life. There is no plan for suicide.
    - References to past actions: ""tonight i stole some my dog's prescription hydrocodone just to feel ok for one night. ive had a bit to drink tonight as well."" These are past actions.
    - Imminence: The actions occurred ""tonight.""
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire ""to feel ok"" and distress (""hit a new low,"" ""not sure what to do""), but *not* a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The purpose of taking the medication and drinking was explicitly stated as ""to feel ok,"" which indicates a desire to alleviate distress, not to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? N/A, no suicidal thoughts are mentioned.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. This is the case here.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. While hydrocodone and alcohol are mentioned, they are explicitly linked to an intent ""to feel ok,"" not to a suicidal act. There is no *suicidal* plan or method mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past actions (""stole,"" ""had a bit to drink"") and current distress.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? The writer describes taking hydrocodone and drinking. However, for this to be classified as 'Attempt', there must be *suicidal intent* behind the action. The post explicitly states the purpose was ""to feel ok,"" which is a coping mechanism, albeit a dangerous one, rather than a suicidal act. Without suicidal intent, it does not qualify as an 'Attempt' in the context of suicide risk classification.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses significant distress and a ""new low.""
    - It describes a dangerous coping mechanism (misuse of prescription medication and alcohol) used ""to feel ok,"" not with suicidal intent.
    - There is no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, or any plan/method for suicide.
    - The actions described, while concerning and potentially harmful, are not presented as a suicidal act or attempt.
    - Based on the definitions, the post expresses general distress and hopelessness but *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author*. The actions described are for coping, not suicide. Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I see no point in living anymore."" This is a strong indicator of a desire to not be alive or a wish for life to end.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no point in living anymore""), despair (""Nothing in my life is working out"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not specified, but the statement reflects a current state of mind.
    - Assessed desire: There is a clear stated desire to not continue living (""no point in living anymore"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I see no point in living anymore"" clearly expresses a desire to not be alive.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the statement is presented as the writer's current feeling.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current feeling/intention.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to not be alive (""I see no point in living anymore""). This moves it beyond general distress (Indicator).
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which differentiates it from Behavior.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, which differentiates it from Attempt.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of Ideation: explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, without a specific plan, method, or preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow."" This is a clear mention of a method (pills/overdose) and a potential outcome (not waking up/death).
    - Emotional indicators: Guilt (""I feel so guilty,"" ""I'm sorry you do now""), feeling like a burden (""my problems are my own not theirs. They deserve so much more than me"").
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""taken a fuck load of pills"" describes the use of a substance as a method.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is in the past tense, indicating an action that has already occurred.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""might not wake up tomorrow"" indicates an imminent potential consequence of the action already taken.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The context of having taken the pills and the expectation of not waking up, combined with the guilt and feeling like a burden, strongly implies a desire for death.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly those words.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow"" clearly expresses a desire for death through an initiated action.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the action has already been taken.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""pills"" as a substance and the action of ""taken a fuck load of pills"" implies an overdose.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills itself is the initiation of the act, which goes beyond mere preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past initiated action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") and its future consequence (""might not wake up tomorrow"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is a concrete, potentially lethal action that was initiated.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post describes a concrete, self-initiated action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") that is potentially lethal, and it has already occurred. This fits the definition of 'Attempt' perfectly. It's not just ideation (thoughts) or behavior (planning/preparation for a future act), but an action that has been carried out.

    - Emotional indicators: ""tired of the constant struggle,"" ""can't find a reason nor can I create one to continue living.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""planning out my suicide"" (general planning), ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest"" (temporal plan/deadline). No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""fear of failing an attempt once again."" This explicitly states a past *initiated action* that was an attempt. ""intend to do it right this time"" reinforces this.
    - Imminence: ""January 1st, by my latest"" indicates a future intention with a deadline.
    - Stated desire: Clear desire to die and carry out the suicide, with no desire to be stopped.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""planning out my suicide,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I will go through with this,"" ""can't find a reason...to continue living.""
    - No negation of desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - A general plan (""planning out my suicide"") and a temporal deadline (""January 1st"") are present. No specific method or detailed preparation (e.g., ""got the pills,"" ""wrote a note"") is mentioned for the *current* plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both a past event and current/future intention.
    - Crucially, it describes a past, specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated: ""fear of failing an attempt once again."" This directly indicates a prior initiated suicidal act.
    - It also describes current planning and future intent (""planning out my suicide,"" ""January 1st,"" ""intend to do it right this time"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear ideation and elements of behavior (planning, temporal deadline).
    - However, the phrase ""fear of failing an attempt once again"" explicitly states that the author has *previously initiated a suicidal act* that was potentially lethal and failed.
    - The definition of 'Attempt' covers ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" It also states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
    - Since a past concrete attempt is clearly described, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification, taking precedence over current ideation/behavior.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""100% do not want to live anymore,"" ""hate being alive,"" ""scared,"" ""weigh down my family and friends"" (burden).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past actions: None.
    *   Imminence: ""should just do it now"" suggests a current contemplation, but ""For now i guess i will just sit here"" indicates no immediate action is being taken or planned.
    *   Assessing desire: There is a clear, stated desire to not be alive (""100% do not want to live anymore,"" ""hate being alive""). The fear of killing self and concern for others are barriers to acting, but do not negate the underlying desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore,"" ""I actually hate being alive.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states they are ""too scared to kill myself"" and ""dont want to weigh down my family and friends."" These are reasons *not* to act, but they do not negate the explicit desire to die. The desire is present, even if acting on it is inhibited by fear/concern.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire and contemplation of a future action (""wonder if i should just do it now"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to not be alive (""100% do not want to live anymore,"" ""hate being alive,"" ""scared to kill myself,"" ""wonder if i should just do it now""). This clearly moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations (e.g., no mention of pills, a gun, a specific location, or writing a note). This means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear desire to die and suicidal thoughts without a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""attempt suicide,"" ""hang myself,"" ""don't die.""
    - Emotional indicators: The act itself, even if ""half-hearted,"" implies distress.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""hang myself,"" ""leave a chair or elevated object."" This describes a specific method and a means of self-interruption.
    - References to past actions: ""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently,"" ""i hang myself but always leave..."" This indicates repeated past actions.
    - Imminence: Describes frequent, ongoing past actions.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""so i don't die,"" indicating an intent to survive *during these specific actions*. However, the *action initiated* is still described as an ""attempt suicide"" and involves a potentially lethal method. The definition of 'Attempt' includes actions ""even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""attempt suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The phrase ""so i don't die"" suggests a lack of desire to complete the act, but the *action initiated* is still labeled an ""attempt suicide."" The focus for 'Attempt' is the initiated action, not necessarily the ultimate desire for death during that specific, interrupted act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""hang myself"" is a specific method, and ""chair or elevated object"" is a tool/means.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, setting up the hanging scenario.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes frequent *past actions* (""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently,"" ""i hang myself but always leave..."").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""i hang myself"" is a specific, self-initiated action. Hanging is a potentially lethal method. The act is described as being initiated and then interrupted by the self (""leave a chair... so i don't die""). This perfectly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly describes *past, specific, self-initiated actions* (""i hang myself"") that are explicitly called ""attempt suicide."" These actions are potentially lethal, even though the author states they ensure they don't die by interrupting the act. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's explicit mention of suicide and specific actions.
    - It's not 'Ideation' because it describes concrete actions, not just thoughts or desires.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because 'Behavior' refers to current/future plans/methods, whereas this describes *initiated past actions*. The key distinction is that the action was *started*.

136,"I wanna move anymore. hey. You don't know me but I figured I could let things out here, my family just had a huge fight over all of our problems and stuff. I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for. Hold on to them. Because life is temporary. And from what I've learned, not everybody gets the happy ending",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:
        - ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now"" - explicit mention of suicidal state.
        - ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out."" - explicit mention of a past suicide attempt.
        - ""After that I had a few close calls but never succeed."" - explicit mention of past near-attempts/failed attempts.
        - ""I see no point anymore"" - expression of hopelessness.
        - ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"" - clear desire to not continue living.
        - ""this world's just not meant for me."" - expression of despair.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling stuck, loneliness, pain.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned for a current or future act.
    - References to past actions: ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out."" and ""After that I had a few close calls but never succeed."" are clear descriptions of initiated, potentially lethal actions.
    - Imminence: The current feelings (""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"") indicate present ideation, but no immediate plan or action.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to not go on, to not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""I've been suicidal"" and ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore.""
    - Yes, clear desire to die or not be alive.
    - No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a *current* or *future* suicidal act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both past events (""i had an attempt when I was 14,"" ""a few close calls"") and current feelings/ideation (""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"").
    - Crucially, it describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past: ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out."" This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The presence of a clear description of a past initiated suicidal act (""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out"") is the defining factor.
    - The definition of 'Attempt' explicitly covers ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""
    - Even though there is current ideation, the rule states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
    - Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I am 29 still live with my parents."" suggests a feeling of being stuck or dissatisfied. The string of random characters and ""fuckkkkkkkk"" indicates extreme frustration, anger, or distress. However, this distress is not explicitly linked to suicidal ideation or intent.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past actions: None.
    *   Imminence: Not applicable.
    *   Writer's stated desire: No stated desire to die or not be alive.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are mentioned.
    *   Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die, 'Ideation' is unlikely.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is not applicable.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current life situation and an expression of extreme frustration.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.
    *   Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses general distress and frustration (""I am 29 still live with my parents. fuckkkkkkkk..."") but **lacks any clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.** There are no suicidal thoughts, no plans, and no past attempts mentioned. The random characters and expletive indicate distress, but not specifically suicidal distress.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to not be alive.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' because there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past or very recent initiated potentially lethal action.
    *   Therefore, it best fits 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress without explicit suicidal intent.

I'm not afraid of killing myself anymore I've done it many times and I figured out how to properly hang myself but at the moment there is too much potential interference. I'll break killing myself regardless.I just wish I could die in my sleep instead. Maybe I'll get lucky and increase my chances of corona if I start cutting again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""finally do it,"" ""killing myself,"" ""die in my sleep,"" ""start cutting again.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""not afraid of killing myself anymore,"" ""wish I could die.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""figured out how to properly hang myself,"" ""start cutting again"" (method).
    - References to past actions: ""I've done it many times"" (ambiguous, could refer to past ideation, self-harm, or attempts), ""start cutting again"" (implies past cutting).
    - Imminence: ""One of these days I'll finally do it,"" ""at the moment there is too much potential interference"" (suggests future intent with current obstacle).
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/kill self.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die. (Yes)
    - The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Specific method: ""hang myself,"" ""cutting."" (Yes)
    - Signs of preparation: ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" (this implies learning/practicing/planning for a specific method). (Yes)
    - Since there is a clear desire to die *and* specific methods/preparations mentioned, this leans towards 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes future intentions (""One of these days I'll finally do it,"" ""I'll break killing myself regardless,"" ""start cutting again"").
    - The phrase ""I've done it many times"" is ambiguous. It could refer to past attempts, but it's not described as a ""specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated."" It's more of a general statement about repeated engagement with suicidal thoughts/behaviors. The context of ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" sounds like current knowledge/preparation for a *future* act, rather than a description of a past failed attempt. If it were a clear past attempt, the phrasing would likely be more direct about the action and its outcome (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself but failed""). The mention of ""cutting again"" is self-harm, which can be an attempt, but here it's stated as a future possibility.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is clear personal suicidal intent and desire to die.
    - Not 'Ideation' because specific methods (""hang myself,"" ""cutting"") and preparation (""figured out how to properly hang myself"") are explicitly mentioned.
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions specific methods and preparations for carrying them out. This aligns perfectly with the 'Behavior' definition.
    - While ""I've done it many times"" could *potentially* hint at past attempts, it is too vague to definitively classify as 'Attempt' according to the definition, which requires description of a ""specific, self-initiated action that was potentially lethal."" The primary focus of the post is on current intent, methods, and future plans.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all"" is a direct reference to suicidal thoughts.
    - Emotional indicators: ""don't know if I'm feeling too alright,"" ""feeling doomed,"" ""as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a sense of impending negative outcome tied to existence.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""For over the course of a year I've been having some thoughts..."" This refers to the *duration of thoughts*, not past *actions*.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated with a timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but the current state of distress (""Currently 8:26 am, I haven't slept"") suggests an ongoing, immediate struggle.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrasing ""thoughts... telling me to end it all"" implies a personal presence of these thoughts. There is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not want to act on them. The context of feeling ""doomed"" reinforces the severity of these thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""end it all"" is a direct euphemism for suicide.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the presence of thoughts ""telling me to end it all"" combined with feeling ""doomed"" indicates a clear, personal expression of suicidal ideation.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, this is not stated.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes ongoing thoughts (""For over the course of a year I've been having some thoughts"") and current feelings of distress.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes *having thoughts*, not *initiating an action*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""thoughts... telling me to end it all"") and feelings of despair (""feeling doomed,"" ""something worse was coming""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The content fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

140,"Just another rant. Keep scrolling. Don't waste your time on a lost cause. I'm almost 30. Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time. I am just a  Useless, shameless, pathetic loser. Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful. I am a useless piece of garbage. Oh wait, garbage can be recycled or made into something. My miserable ass is is as useless as the shit that comes out of it.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in."" These are specific methods and actions. The phrase ""Why should I still live"" indicates a desire to not be alive.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Suffering from depression and anxiety,"" ""hate myself,"" ""guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell,"" ""useless, shameless, pathetic loser,"" ""miserable ass."" These show deep despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** Specific methods (drowning, hanging, jumping) and a location (4th floor) are mentioned, but in the context of *past* actions. No *current* plan or preparation is stated.
    *   **References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed:** Yes, ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor... But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time."" These clearly describe initiated, potentially lethal actions that were not completed.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The post describes past actions, not immediate future intentions.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die/not be alive, expressed through the questioning of why they should live and the regret over ""chickening out"" of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words, but the described actions (""tried to drown myself,"" ""tried to hang,"" ""tried to jump"") are direct descriptions of suicidal acts.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Why should I still live and waste the resources..."" combined with the self-deprecating language and regret over past failed attempts.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses regret for *not* completing the past actions (""chickened out"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, specific methods (drowning, hanging, jumping) and a location (4th floor) are mentioned, but these relate to *past* actions, not a current plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The description of ""tried to drown myself,"" ""tried to hang,"" ""tried to jump off from the 4th floor"" implies the initiation of these acts, which would involve preparation (e.g., going to the location, attempting the method).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past events (""I tried to...""). While there's current despair and ideation about not wanting to live, the core element for classification here is the description of past actions.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor."" These are concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions, even if they were ultimately aborted or failed (""chickened out""). This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes multiple specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions taken by the author in the past (""tried to drown myself,"" ""tried to hang,"" ""tried to jump off from the 4th floor""). Even though the author states they ""chickened out,"" these were *initiated actions* that fit the definition of an 'Attempt' (actions that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted or failed). The presence of these past initiated actions overrides current ideation for classification.

    - Imminence: ""I might actually get the courage to do it"" suggests a potential future action, but without a specific timeline or plan.
    - Assesses the writer's stated desire: There is a clear and strong stated desire to die and act on suicidal thoughts (""Living is not for me,"" ""I'm becoming more confident to kill myself,"" ""I might actually get the courage to do it"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:

    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The statement about being 15 is hypothetical, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'm becoming more confident to kill myself,"" ""I might actually get the courage to do it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., ""pills,"" ""gun,"" ""bridge,"" ""note""). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated* suicidal action. The mention of ""when I was 15"" is hypothetical, not an actual attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the clear expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but without a specific plan or initiated action, the post best fits the 'Ideation' category.

    - References to past actions: No specific past actions, but mentions hiding intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""be dead in less than 24 hours"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""be dead"" and ""die"" in this context clearly convey suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""be dead in less than 24 hours.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states they *will* act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""Trazodone and alcohol"" is a specific method (overdose).
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""will get alcohol today"" indicates a step towards acquiring the means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state leading to a clear future intention: ""will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours.""
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes a plan for the future, not a completed or interrupted past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""be dead,"" ""die""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It explicitly mentions a specific method (""Trazodone and alcohol"") and a preparatory step (""will get alcohol today""). This presence of a plan and preparation rules out 'Ideation'.
    - The action described is a future intention, not a past initiated action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal intent *and* mentions a specific plan/method and preparation.

    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to ""give up"" is expressed as a current personal feeling, not an unwanted thought.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. In this case, the desire is clearly expressed, even if not with the word ""suicide.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current intention (""I want to give up"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') by expressing a clear personal desire to ""give up"" and questioning their existence and worth, which indicates a desire to not be alive.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer, without a specific plan or method.

(Maybe cushion the pain idk. )I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""let myself pass away,"" ""kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself,"" ""I'm going to die,"" ""when I die.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Maybe cushion the pain idk"" (implies consideration for others, but doesn't negate the intent).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states a method (""slowly kill myself this way"" referring to anorexia/starvation) and a specific target/goal (""new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me""). This is a clear plan involving a specific means (starvation to a lethal weight).
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""I'm going to die"" - implies a current decision and ongoing process with a future fatal intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear and explicit desire to die (""finally kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself,"" ""I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""for it to finally kill me"").
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""slowly kill myself this way"" through anorexia/starvation to a specific, lethal weight (""new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me""). Setting this ""goal weight"" for the purpose of dying constitutes a plan/preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current intention and an ongoing process leading to a future outcome (""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""my new goal weight is... for it to finally kill me"").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and a desire to die.
    - Not 'Ideation' because there is not only suicidal intent but also a specific method/plan (starvation to a lethal weight) explicitly stated.
    - Not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent *initiated action* that was potentially lethal is described. The post describes a current plan and future intent.
    - This fits 'Behavior' perfectly as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions a specific method and a plan (anorexia/starvation to a goal weight for the purpose of dying).

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: Yes, ""suicide"" and ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" (a specific method for carbon monoxide poisoning).
    - Emotional indicators: Not explicitly stated, but the inquiry about a suicide method implies distress and contemplation of suicide.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: A specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent"") is mentioned and inquired about.
    - References to past actions: No.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not stated, it's a question about possibility.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The question ""Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?"" implies a personal consideration or research into a specific suicide method, suggesting a desire or strong contemplation of suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the question about the *possibility* of a specific suicide method for oneself strongly implies a personal intent or exploration of suicide. It's not an abstract discussion.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a specific, well-known method for suicide (carbon monoxide poisoning).
    - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicit preparation, but asking about the viability of a specific method is a step towards planning or considering its use.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It's a current inquiry, potentially for a future intention.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's a question about possibility, not a description of an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator': Too specific. This post directly mentions ""suicide"" and a specific method, not just general distress or abstract discussion.
    - 'Ideation': The post goes beyond mere ideation because it mentions a *specific method* (""charcoal bbq in a tent""). The definition of Ideation states ""without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.""
    - 'Behavior': The post includes an explicit mention of ""suicide"" (implying personal intent through the nature of the question) AND mentions a specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent""). The definition of Behavior includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" Asking about the possibility of a specific method fits the criterion of mentioning a specific method.
    - 'Attempt': No past or very recent initiated action is described.

Based on the analysis, the mention of a specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent"") in the context of ""suicide"" moves it from Ideation to Behavior.

146,"Life so full of contradictions that it's not worth it. I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post states, ""So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault."" This is a clear expression of a desire to die. However, it also explicitly states, ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" (likely a typo for ""committing suicide"" or ""committing it""). This second statement is a crucial negation of intent to act.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""not worth it,"" ""don't think I'll escape it,"" ""never be good enough""), despair, self-loathing (""everything about me is wrong,"" ""hate everything about how I look,"" ""self loathing""), feeling like a burden (""everyone would be better off without dealing with me,"" ""embarrassment for everyone"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: Mentions a past relationship ending, but no past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: No imminence mentioned.
    - Writer's stated desire: There's a contradiction. ""Makes me want want to die"" indicates a desire, but ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" explicitly negates the *intent to act* on that desire. The latter part of the sentence (""I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me..."") describes a thought process about others' well-being, not a personal desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""want to die"" is present.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""makes me want want to die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" This is a strong negation of the intent to act. The definition for 'Indicator' specifically mentions: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The phrase ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" fits this criterion, indicating that while the *idea* of dying or being gone might be present, the *personal intent to act* is explicitly denied.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current feelings and thoughts.
    - Crucially, does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The presence of ""want to die"" initially points towards 'Ideation'.
    - However, the subsequent explicit negation ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" is critical. This statement indicates that despite the distressing thoughts and feelings, the author is *not* expressing a current personal desire to *act* on suicidal impulses. They are expressing distress and the *idea* that others would be better off without them, but explicitly stating they don't feel like taking action.
    - This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die...""
    - The post is primarily about the author's deep distress, self-loathing, and feeling like a burden, with the explicit denial of suicidal intent to act.

We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time. I loved him so much and felt so lucky to be with him. I don't really know what to do. I'm just passively letting whatever happen happen. I don't care. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I don't want to live""). This rules out 'Indicator' which lacks clear personal intent.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific pills, a location, writing a note). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal thoughts/desire to die without a plan or past attempt.

148,"3 weeks TW(animal abuse-sexual assault-murder). I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. it doesn't help having this bullshit thing women have every month. But I can't do it anymore. Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down. Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human? Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The phrase ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down"" directly refers to the writer's own life, using a metaphor of a sick animal needing euthanasia. ""It sounds weird hearing the 'dog' put itself down"" reinforces this self-directed intent to end life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I can't do it anymore,"" ""Im tired,"" ""Nothing's real to me anymore,"" ""I can't find a way to release,"" ""I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything,"" ""abomination,"" ""What is wrong with me."" These show profound despair, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None are mentioned. The ""put down"" metaphor implies an end, but not a specific method or tool.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are described.
    - Imminence: ""3 weeks"" indicates a deadline, suggesting a future intention, but not immediate.
    - Writer's stated desire: The metaphor of being a ""sick dog"" that ""has to be put down"" and ""put itself down"" clearly conveys a personal desire to end their own life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, through the extended metaphor of the ""sick dog"" needing to be ""put down"" by itself. This is a clear, albeit indirect, expression of a desire for self-euthanasia.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is implied as something that will eventually happen (""Eventually it'll get sick enough..."").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. The ""put down"" metaphor does not specify *how* this would occur.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of despair and a future intention (the ""3 weeks"" deadline, and the eventual ""put down"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress; it clearly expresses a personal desire to end one's life through the ""put down"" metaphor. Thus, it's not 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out this desire. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal act. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer (via the metaphor) without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" ""suicide pact,"" ""demise."" Discusses not using ""a weapon from my household"" and not wanting anyone ""find me that wasn't trained to do so,"" implying consideration of methods/circumstances.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""slump and horrid hole of thoughts,"" ""enormous sense of relief"" (when out of slump), ""calmed me down"" (drafting will), ""tired,"" ""delicate,"" ""weak,"" ""can't 'click' into life."" Also, ""shame, or guilt"" for backing off.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months."" Crucially, ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" This is a concrete preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""plotting"" has been ""on and off for months."" ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" is a specific past action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The user states ""Today, I feel better. I am out of my hole for now. I don't think I would do 'it'."" This indicates low *current* imminence, but the post is about the *history* and *ongoing nature* of the thoughts and preparations.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The user describes the thought of suicide feeling like an ""obligation"" and a ""suicide pact."" While they state they are ""out of my hole for now"" and ""I don't think I would do 'it',"" the core of the post is about the persistent pull and the concrete steps (plotting, drafting will) taken in the past, even if currently in a better state. The ""feeling like I am not following through"" also suggests a conflict with the desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" ""suicide pact,"" ""demise.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the ""obligation"" and ""plotting"" indicate a serious engagement with the idea of dying, even if currently resisted. The phrase ""I just can't 'click' into life"" also points to a lack of desire for life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? They state ""I don't think I would do 'it'"" and ""I am out of my hole for now,"" indicating current resistance. However, the ""obligation"" and ""not following through"" suggest the desire/thoughts are still very much present and powerful, even if not acted upon *at this moment*. The past actions (plotting, will) demonstrate a prior, serious intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method for *current* intent, but the user rules out ""weapon from my household"" and not wanting anyone ""find me that wasn't trained,"" implying consideration of methods and scenarios.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""drafted my will"" is a clear preparation. ""Plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months"" also indicates a planning phase.
    *   If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. If there is *any* mention of a method or preparation, it leans towards 'Behavior'. The drafted will is a concrete preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. ""Plotting... for months"" and ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" are past actions related to suicidal intent. The current state is better, but the post is about the *lingering* nature of these thoughts and actions.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes ""plotting"" and ""drafting a will,"" which are planning and preparation, not an *initiated lethal action*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""can't click into life,"" ""obligation""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The presence of ""plotting my suicide seriously"" and, more definitively, ""drafted my will"" constitutes specific planning and preparations. This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' into 'Behavior'. The definition of Behavior explicitly includes ""preparations being taken.""
    *   No actual *initiated lethal action* is described, only planning and preparation. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    *   The key elements are the explicit suicidal intent combined with concrete preparations (drafting a will) and ongoing plotting.

Final decision leans towards 'Behavior' due to the explicit mention of ""plotting"" and the concrete action of ""drafting my will"" as preparations for suicide, even if the immediate intent is stated as low.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No direct mentions. The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is present, which indicates feeling like a burden, a known suicide risk factor, but it's not a direct statement of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""i hate tough love,"" ""stressed,"" ""not in a good mood,"" ""brings me anxiety,"" ""sick of this endless myopic bouts of 'criticism',"" ""abused enough at home,"" ""don't need this shit among my friends,"" ""i want it to stop,"" ""if i leave them i have no one."" These indicate significant distress, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, and social isolation/lack of support.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence of intentions: No intentions stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire for the ""shit"" (criticism, abuse) to stop and a feeling of being trapped (""if i leave them i have no one""). There is no explicit stated desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is a statement about how *someone else* would feel, implying the author feels like a burden, but it is not a direct statement of the author's desire to die or not be alive. The primary stated desire is for the negative experiences to stop.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as explicit suicidal thoughts are not stated.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. This is the case here.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current distress and past/ongoing negative interactions.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses significant general distress, feelings of being a burden, and social isolation. These are strong indicators of mental health struggles and potential suicide risk factors.
    - However, it *lacks* an explicit, personal statement of suicidal intent or a desire to die. The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is concerning as it relates to feeling like a burden, but it doesn't directly state ""I want to die"" or ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    - There are no mentions of plans, methods, or past attempts.
    - Based on the definitions, the post fits the 'Indicator' category because it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and potential risk factors, but without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The rule ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator"" applies here.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No direct mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or self-harm. The phrase ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally"" is directed at another person (""you"") and implies a wish for *that person* to be gone or dead, not the author themselves.
    - Note emotional indicators: Intense anger, frustration, exhaustion (""I'm so tired,"" ""no more energy,"" ""sucked my soul out dry""), despair (""the world is just fucked,"" ""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED"").
    - Look for specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None.
    - Check for references to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: The post refers to past actions done *to* the author or their family (""why did you this? why us? why didn't you tell my dad what they did? how can you do those sorts of things to a child.""), not past suicidal actions by the author.
    - Note the imminence of any stated intentions: No intentions of self-harm are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses extreme anger and exhaustion directed at another person (""you"") and the general state of the world. There is no explicit statement of a personal desire to die or not be alive for themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The exhaustion and despair are expressed in the context of external circumstances and anger towards another person, not as a personal desire for death.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. This is the case here.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past traumatic events that are causing current intense emotional distress (anger, exhaustion). There are no current or future intentions of self-harm.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly indicates significant distress, anger, and exhaustion.
    - However, it *lacks* any explicit personal expression of suicidal intent or a desire to die *by the author*. The anger and despair are directed outwards or at the general state of the world, and the wish for ""peace"" is directed at the ""you"" in the post, not the author's own life ending.
    - There are no mentions of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts by the author.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks clear, current, personal suicidal intent.

152,"I don't want to kill myself, but. I have literally nothing going for me. I graduated college almost 2 years ago, and I still don't have a job. I pushed all my friends away. I barely leave the house anymore. All I want is to have a job so I can be a normal, functioning member of society. I just want to have a sense of purpose. I want to meet new people and go places. I'm so sick of sitting inside all day, waiting for the next day in hopes it will somehow be the day where everything changes. I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life. And at this rate, I really feel like nothing is going to change. It's been so stagnant for so long. Everyone I know has a great job, a great relationship, their own apartment; they're all moving forward in life, meanwhile I'm still sitting in the same house that I grew up in. I'm so sick of this. I've always been a melancholic guy, but I really want to give life a chance. I want to have financial independence, a girlfriend, hobbies, and see where it takes me. But it seems like the world rejects me at every turn. I've always prided myself on being a pretty tough and resilient person, but I've reached a point where I really don't know what's next for me. I feel like the walls are closing in and there's no escape.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I don't want to kill myself."" No other direct mentions of suicide, death, or self-harm are present.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing going for me,"" ""nothing is going to change,"" ""walls are closing in and there's no escape""), despair (implied by the feeling of stagnation and being ""sick of this life""), anhedonia (implied by ""sick of sitting inside all day"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    - Imminence of intentions: No suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""I don't want to kill myself"" and expresses a desire to ""give life a chance,"" ""have financial independence, a girlfriend, hobbies,"" and ""meet new people and go places."" Their distress is about their current stagnant life situation, not a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I don't want to kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, it explicitly negates this desire and expresses a desire to live a better life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I don't want to kill myself"" directly states they do not want to act on suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings of stagnation and a desire for a different future, but no suicidal intentions or actions.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped (""walls are closing in and there's no escape"").
    - However, the crucial element is the explicit statement: ""I don't want to kill myself."" This directly negates personal suicidal intent or a desire to die.
    - The writer expresses a desire to improve their life and ""give life a chance,"" indicating a will to live despite the difficulties.
    - This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness... but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die.""
    - It does not fit 'Ideation' because there is no explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent.
    - It does not fit 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' as there is no plan, method, preparation, or past initiated action.

Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""overwhelming and difficult,"" ""in a rut,"" ""very small support system,"" ""too weak and pathetic.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""die tomorrow while my mom is out with family"" - This indicates a specific *time* and *circumstance*, but not a *method* (e.g., pills, gun, jumping).
        *   ""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" - This could be interpreted as a form of farewell or preparation (saying goodbye), but the phrase ""try and go out"" is ambiguous. It could mean ""try and die"" or ""try and go out socially one last time."" It's not a concrete preparation like ""writing a note"" or ""acquiring means.""
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""tomorrow.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself."" This is a clear, explicit desire to die. The phrase ""I know I shouldn't"" indicates internal conflict, but doesn't negate the stated desire. ""I just am too weak and pathetic to do it"" indicates a perceived barrier to action, not a lack of desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself"").
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself"").
    *   Does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer says ""I know I shouldn't,"" but this is immediately followed by a clear desire and a statement of perceived weakness preventing action, not a negation of the desire itself. The primary sentiment is a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge, overdose, jump) is mentioned. The timing (""tomorrow"") and circumstance (""mom is out"") are mentioned, but not *how*.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" *could* be a preparation (farewell), but it's not explicit or concrete enough to definitively classify as a preparation for a *specific suicidal act*. It's ambiguous.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Describes a current/future intention: Yes, ""I want to die tomorrow.""
    *   Describes a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal, current desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so 'Attempt' is ruled out.
    *   The crucial distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Behavior' requires a *specific plan, method, or concrete preparations*. While there's a stated time (""tomorrow"") and a potentially ambiguous preparation (""hit up everyone... and try and go out""), there is no *specific method* mentioned (e.g., ""I'm going to take pills,"" ""I'm going to jump""). The ambiguity of ""try and go out"" and the lack of a concrete method mean it doesn't meet the explicit criteria for 'Behavior'. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" In this case, the method is entirely absent, and the preparation is vague.

Therefore, the post expresses clear suicidal ideation and a desire to die, but lacks the explicit, concrete plan, method, or preparations required for 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""dead inside,"" ""yeet myself"" (a strong colloquialism for self-harm or suicide).
    - Emotional indicators: ""useless life,"" ""depressive episode,"" ""dead inside,"" ""still sad,"" ""anhedonic,"" ""beyond saving,"" ""want to cry.""
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned. ""Yeet myself"" is an expression of intent, not a specific method.
    - References to past actions: ""after having a huge depressive episode"" - general past emotional state, not a specific suicidal action.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"" indicates a strong current urge.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to ""yeet myself,"" which implies a desire to end the suffering or life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? ""Yeet myself"" is a strong, direct colloquial phrase indicating self-harm/suicide. Yes.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""useless life,"" ""still dead inside,"" ""I must be beyond saving,"" and the desire to ""yeet myself"" all point to a desire to end the current state of existence/suffering.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a *desire* to act on them (""I just want to... yeet myself"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""Yeet myself"" is an expression of the act itself, not a specific means (like ""pills"" or ""gun"").
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily a current intention/desire (""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes a strong desire/urge, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire for self-harm/suicide (""I just want to... yeet myself"") and feelings of hopelessness (""useless life,"" ""dead inside,"" ""beyond saving""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (like a type of pill, a location, or acquiring means). Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The content aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded."" ""End it"" is a common euphemism for suicide. ""Wish I succeeded"" indicates a desire for a past suicidal act to have been fatal.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""i fucked up this time,"" ""God im such a fucking loser,"" ""despair"" (related to potential loss of license/job and moving back home).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for a *current* intention.
    *   References to past actions: ""I tried to end it once before."" This is a direct statement of a past initiated action.
    *   Imminence: Not present for a current intention.
    *   Writer's stated desire: The desire is expressed in relation to the past action (""wish i succeeded""). The current distress is about life circumstances, but the suicidal element is tied to a past attempt and a lingering wish about its outcome.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end it"" is a strong euphemism for suicide.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" expresses a clear desire for a past suicidal act to have been successful, meaning a desire to have died.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the wish is that the past attempt *succeeded*.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, not for a *current* plan. The past action ""tried to end it"" does not specify a method, but it clearly indicates an *action* was initiated.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for a *current* plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""I tried to end it once before"") and a current feeling about that past event (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""I tried to end it once before"" directly describes a past, self-initiated action that was intended to be lethal. This fits the definition of an 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains general distress and feelings of failure, which are 'Indicator' elements.
    *   The phrase ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" expresses a desire to have died, which could be 'Ideation' if it were only a thought.
    *   However, the key phrase ""I tried to end it once before"" explicitly states a *past initiated action* that was potentially lethal. This is the defining characteristic of the 'Attempt' category. The definition of 'Attempt' specifically includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" It also states that if a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.
    *   The presence of a clear statement of a past attempt takes precedence over general distress or current ideation.

    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The phrase ""I just wanna"" indicates a current desire, but not a specific immediate action or plan.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to ""kill myself,"" even if driven by fear/panic.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or self-harm. Phrases like ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" strongly imply a desire to end one's life or current suffering.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Screaming at me to give up,"" ""defeated,"" ""torture cycle,"" ""why keep going?"" - these indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed:** ""Every time I am back here"" suggests a recurring pattern of distress, but no specific past suicidal *actions* are described.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No specific temporal markers (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The phrases ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" clearly express a personal desire to end their current state of existence/suffering, rather than just expressing distress about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" in the context of feeling defeated and in a ""torture cycle"" strongly convey a desire for life to end or for their suffering to cease permanently.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post does not negate the desire; instead, it questions the value of continuing. While ""my brain is screaming at me"" indicates internal conflict, the concluding ""why keep going?"" aligns with the idea of giving up.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of mind (""Now my brain is screaming..."") and a questioning of future continuation (""why keep going?"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) by expressing a clear desire to end suffering/life (""get it over with,"" ""why keep going?""). This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer states they ""currently have suicidal thoughts."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not wish to act on them. It's a direct statement of experiencing suicidal thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive: The phrase ""suicidal thoughts"" directly indicates a contemplation or desire related to suicide. It's a personal expression of such thoughts.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them: No, there is no negation or statement of not wanting these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state/intention (""currently have suicidal thoughts"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit, personal expression of ""suicidal thoughts."" This moves it beyond general distress (Indicator).
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out suicide. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. This distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    - The content directly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

159,Anyone here genuinely upset that they are planning to commit suicide?. My life won't ever be the same again and I can't change my circumstances that much so far. I'll never be happy if I continue to live but I'm angry also because if it weren't for my situation I would be happy to continue living. So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""planning to commit suicide"", ""have to go"" (in the context of ending life), ""no choice but to end it"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""genuinely upset"", ""angry"", ""miserable"", ""sad"", ""mad"".
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""planning to commit suicide"" implies a current, active intention, though no specific timeline like ""tonight"" is given.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states they are ""planning to commit suicide"" and feel they ""have to go"" / ""no choice but to end it"". While there is sadness and anger about this perceived necessity, the desire to end their life is clearly present and personal.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""planning to commit suicide"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I have to go"", ""no choice but to end it"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer states they are *planning* it, even if they are upset about the circumstances leading to it.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention (""planning to commit suicide"", ""I have to go"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent (""planning to commit suicide"", ""I have to go"", ""no choice but to end it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., type of pills, location, weapon, note writing). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses clear personal suicidal thoughts and desire to die without a specific plan or method.

I was so close to attempting suicide  but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am, dropping out of college and planning the move back home. I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""attempting suicide"" is mentioned multiple times.
    - Emotional indicators: ""regretting it immensely,"" ""not mentally stable,"" ""mortifying and embarrassing,"" ""want to rip my hair out,"" ""feel nauseous,"" ""dreading this,"" ""cannot stand living with my family."" These indicate significant distress, shame, and aversion to the current situation.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned for a current or future act.
    - References to past actions: The post states, ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am..."" This clearly indicates that an attempt was *considered* and the person was *on the verge* of it, but it was *not initiated*. The person chose an alternative (reaching out and moving back home).
    - Imminence: The imminence was in the past, leading to the decision to seek help. There is no stated current imminent intention to attempt suicide.
    - Assessed desire: The post implies a past strong desire to end their life (""going through with attempting suicide"") that was averted by choosing a difficult alternative. The current desire is not explicitly stated as suicidal, but rather as distress about the consequences of their past choice.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""attempting suicide"" is mentioned.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? It expresses a past situation where attempting suicide was a very serious consideration (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide,"" ""so close to attempting suicide""). While the current post focuses on the distress of the alternative, the explicit mention of being ""so close"" to an attempt indicates a very high level of suicidal intent in the recent past.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer chose *not* to act on them by seeking help, implying a desire to avoid the attempt, despite the severity of the thoughts. However, the thoughts themselves were clearly serious and personal, not just unwanted intrusive thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past decision point where an attempt was nearly made, and the current consequences of choosing an alternative.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The phrases ""so close to attempting suicide"" and ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" explicitly state that the attempt was *not initiated*. The writer chose an alternative.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly indicates a very high level of suicidal thoughts and a strong consideration of an attempt in the recent past (""so close to attempting suicide,"" ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide""). This goes beyond general distress (Indicator).
    - However, no specific plan, method, or preparation for a *current* or *future* act is mentioned (ruling out Behavior).
    - Most importantly, the attempt was *not initiated*. The person explicitly states they were ""so close"" but then ""dumped everything on my mom,"" indicating the attempt was averted. This rules out Attempt, which requires an *initiated action*.
    - Therefore, the post describes severe suicidal ideation where an attempt was very nearly made but ultimately not carried out. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings, without an initiated action or a current plan/method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course"". No other mentions of self-harm or specific methods are present.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I cant take it,"" ""pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity,"" ""Its excruciating."" These indicate high levels of distress and pain.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to suicide. The desire to ""scream and break everything"" is an expression of frustration and pain, not a suicidal plan.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not applicable as suicidal intent is negated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course"", indicating a clear lack of desire to die by suicide, despite intense pain. They are expressing distress, not suicidal intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, it explicitly negates this desire with ""I wont kill myself of course.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I wont kill myself of course"" clearly states they do not intend to act on such thoughts, or that suicide is not their intent despite the pain. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition where suicidal thoughts are mentioned but explicitly stated as unwanted or not representing a current personal desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a clear *lack* of current suicidal intention.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant general distress and pain (""I cant take it,"" ""excruciating"").
    - It mentions ""kill myself"" but immediately and explicitly negates any personal suicidal intent (""I wont kill myself of course"").
    - This fits the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die."" The author is expressing distress and explicitly stating they do not intend to commit suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post expresses distress related to gender dysphoria and body image (""obsessing over appearance,"" ""intensified my gender dysphoria,"" ""I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing""). The author states a desire to ""be a male now."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, or preparations. There is no stated desire to die or not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT: The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or any similar direct phrases. It does not express a clear desire to die or not be alive. The distress is related to gender identity and appearance, not suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION: No plan, method, or preparation for a suicidal act is mentioned or implied.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT: The post describes current feelings and desires. It does not describe any past, current, or future potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and negative emotions related to gender dysphoria and appearance. However, it completely lacks any mention of suicidal thoughts, intent, desire to die, or self-harm. It fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress but ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""end it all"" (implies suicide), ""loathe my existence."" No specific methods/means.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""absolutely hate myself,"" ""loathe my existence,"" ""bad one"" (referring to the day).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** None related to suicidal acts.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** No imminence stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The post begins with ""I wish I had the courage to end it all,"" which indicates a desire to die. However, this is immediately contradicted by ""And yet. I just want the courage to endure it all."" The rest of the post focuses on enduring, waiting for better days, and offering support to others (""you aren't alone,"" ""here I stay. waiting,"" ""Stay around to see these days""). The overall sentiment shifts from an initial expression of suicidal ideation to one of struggling but choosing to endure and provide support.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** ""end it all"" is a direct phrase implying suicide.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive?** ""I wish I had the courage to end it all"" expresses this. However, the subsequent text heavily negates this desire, explicitly stating ""I just want the courage to endure it all"" and encouraging self and others to ""Stay around.""
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** While not explicitly saying ""I don't want these thoughts,"" the writer explicitly states a desire to *endure* and *stay*, which directly counters the desire to ""end it all."" The prevailing message is one of struggling but choosing to live and support.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned.
    *   No signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Describes current feelings and a struggle between suicidal thoughts and a desire to endure.
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action initiated in the past or very recently.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a phrase (""I wish I had the courage to end it all"") that, in isolation, would strongly suggest Ideation. However, the immediate and strong counter-statement (""And yet. I just want the courage to endure it all"") and the subsequent focus on resilience, waiting for better days, and offering support to others (""here I stay. waiting,"" ""you aren't alone,"" ""Stay around to see these days"") significantly shifts the overall meaning.
    *   The definition of 'Indicator' allows for mentions of suicidal thoughts if they are ""explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die."" While the thoughts aren't explicitly unwanted, the desire to *act* on them is directly contradicted by the desire to *endure*. The post depicts a struggle with suicidal thoughts, but ultimately concludes with a message of choosing to stay and support, rather than a clear, current desire to die. The predominant sentiment is distress and a struggle, but with an ultimate leaning towards enduring, which fits the 'Indicator' category more accurately than 'Ideation' where a clear, current desire to die is present without such strong negation or counter-intent. The ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator"" rule also applies here due to the conflicting desires expressed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now"", ""almost committed suicide"", ""still consider"".
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""wouldn't be alive right now""), distress (""anxiety has gotten much more severe"", ""interfering with almost everything i do""), feeling misunderstood/unsupported (""mother doesn't believe i need a therapist anymore""), isolation (""spend it alone"", ""no friends at school""), family conflict (""sick of my family"", ""shitty parents and siblings"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""didn't have anything to do it with"" in reference to the past ""almost committed suicide"". There is no mention of a current or future specific plan, method, or preparation.
    - References to past actions: ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"". This describes a strong intent and proximity to an act, but the act itself was not initiated due to lack of means.
    - Imminence: ""still consider"" implies ongoing thoughts. No immediate temporal markers for an action.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear personal desire to die or engage in suicidal acts (""wouldn't be alive right now"", ""almost committed suicide"", ""still consider"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""almost committed suicide"" and ""still consider"".
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die or not be alive, indicated by ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now"" and the consideration of suicide.
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they ""still consider"" them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied. The post explicitly states ""didn't have anything to do it with"", indicating a lack of means/plan at the time of the ""almost"" event. No current plan is described.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - Since there's a desire to die but no clear indication of a plan/method/preparation, this leans towards 'Ideation' for the current state.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past event (""a few days ago i almost committed suicide"") and a current/future intention (""yet i still consider"").
    - The crucial part is ""almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"". This indicates a very strong intent to act, but the *action itself was not initiated* because the means were unavailable. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""specific, self-initiated action"". Since the action was not initiated due to lack of means, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'. It describes a very high level of ideation that was thwarted by external factors, not an initiated action that was interrupted or failed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die (""almost committed suicide"", ""still consider"").
    - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for a current or future suicidal act. The past event was prevented by lack of means, not a plan.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because, while there was strong intent, the action itself was not *initiated* due to the absence of means (""didn't have anything to do it with""). 'Attempt' requires an initiated, potentially lethal action.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation'. The author expresses clear suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, and even describes a recent instance where they were very close to acting, but without a described initiated action or current plan/method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned multiple times.
    - Emotional indicators: The request ""can anyone suicide with me together"" indicates a strong desire for suicide and implies despair.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. It's a general invitation for a shared act.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not specified (no ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire for suicide, and an active seeking of others to join in this act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide with me.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, by inviting others to ""suicide with me together.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively seeking to act on them and involve others.
    - Conclusion: There is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Conclusion: No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. This rules out 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire and a future intention to act (""can anyone suicide with me together"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to act on them (""suicide with me""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a past initiated action, which distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    - It goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, as it clearly expresses a personal desire for suicide, ruling out 'Indicator'.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses explicit suicidal intent without any specific plan or past attempt.

I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I want to kms,"" ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself,"" ""put the rope around my neck,"" ""practice hung.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""can't stop thinking about killing myself,"" ""afraid of failing,"" ""burden.""
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""hang myself,"" ""rope."" The user describes putting the rope around their neck and ""practice hung"" for a minute or two. This is an initiated action involving a method.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped..."" This describes a concrete, self-initiated action.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""right now,"" ""can't focus on anything except trying again,"" ""don't feel like I can wait any longer.""
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/kms.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kms,"" ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself,"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to kms,"" ""I really want to hang myself right now"").
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""hang myself"") and tool (""rope"") are mentioned.
    - Crucially, the post describes an *initiated action* involving this method and tool: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two."" This goes beyond just having a plan or making preparations; it's an action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past, very recent initiated action: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped..."" This action, even if described as ""practice"" and stopped, was a specific, self-initiated act that was potentially lethal (hanging for a minute or two).
    - It also describes current/future intention to try again (""can't focus on anything except trying again,"" ""don't feel like I can wait any longer"").
    - The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The described action fits this.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires ('Ideation') because it describes a specific method and an *initiated action* involving that method.
    - It also goes beyond just having a plan or making preparations for a future act ('Behavior') because a concrete, potentially lethal action was *initiated* in the past/very recently (""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung"").
    - The description of ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"" directly aligns with the 'Attempt' definition of a ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated action...that was potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The fear of failing and ending up in ICU further indicates an understanding of the lethality of the action. Even though it was stopped, the action was initiated.
    - The rule states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" This applies here.

I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job. I've pushed my fiancé away I guess if he didn't even bother to do this for me, to care that I haven't stopped crying. I just want to fucking die.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""finally going to actually do it,"" ""ready to do it,"" ""violently suicidal,"" ""I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead,"" ""I'll finally be at peace,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more,"" ""suicidal ideation.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""sobbing,"" ""overwhelmed,"" ""fucking failure,"" ""burden,"" feeling unloved/uncared for. High levels of despair and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" This is a *thought* about a method, not a current acquisition or a definite plan to acquire or use it. The preceding phrase ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it"" negates a concrete plan. No preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions ""suicidal ideation"" in the past, but not a past *attempt*.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""finally going to actually do it,"" ""finally ready to do it,"" ""finally fucking time."" This indicates strong current intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die and not be alive.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and a clear desire to die (""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A method (gun) is *mentioned* as something the author ""always thought"" they would use, but immediately qualified with ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it"" and ""I don't know though."" This indicates a lack of a *specific, actionable plan* or *current acquisition/preparation*. It's a general idea of a method, not a concrete plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current and future intention to die. It mentions past ""suicidal ideation"" but no past *attempt* (initiated action).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   While a method (gun) is *mentioned*, the author explicitly states ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it"" and ""I don't know though,"" which means there is no *specific, actionable plan* or *preparations* described. The definition for 'Behavior' requires a clear plan/method/preparation. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Based on the author's stated uncertainty about *how* they will do it, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated potentially lethal action*, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' due to the explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without a specific, actionable plan or preparation.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""end things"" (a clear euphemism for suicide), ""don't want me dead"", ""at the edge"" (implies suicidal intent).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""apathetic about my existing,"" ""want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb."" This indicates deep despair and a desire for escape/anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This indicates a chosen location and an explicit intention to act upon arrival.
    *   **References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed:** ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This describes a *very recently completed action* (driving to the location) that was undertaken *with suicidal intent*. The subsequent statement ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" indicates that the final act was not completed, but the *initiation* of the plan was.
    *   **Imminence:** ""just finished driving up"" indicates a very recent event.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer *had* ""full intentions to end things"" when driving, indicating a strong desire at that point. While they now state ""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" the description of the *past initiated action* with lethal intent is central.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end things"" is a very strong and clear euphemism for suicide in this context.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the ""full intentions to end things"" clearly expresses this desire at the time of the action. The current sentiment is a pulling back from that *immediate* desire, but the past action was driven by it.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" indicates a current decision *not* to act, despite the prior initiated action.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""driving up to the mountains"" is a specific location chosen *with full intentions to end things*. This is more than just thinking about a plan; it's the *initiation* of a plan involving a specific location.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Driving to a specific location with the stated intent to ""end things"" is a significant preparatory step and an initiation of the act itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *very recent past event*: ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" It also describes a current state of mind where the immediate intention to act has receded.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes. The act of ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" is a concrete, self-initiated action taken with lethal intent. Even though the final lethal step was not completed (""I don't think I'm going to do it""), the *initiation* of the act (going to the location with intent) fits the definition of an attempted action that was self-interrupted.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The key phrase is ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This is not merely ideation (thoughts) or behavior (a plan being discussed), but a concrete, self-initiated action (driving to a specific location) with a clear suicidal intent. The fact that the final act was not completed, or that the person pulled back, means it was an *interrupted* or *failed* attempt, which falls under the 'Attempt' definition: ""self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I'm ready to die"", ""for me to go out the way I want"", ""ready to go"".
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life""), despair (""Fuck this world"").
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""The date was set a while ago"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"". While no specific method is named, the mention of ""date was set"" and ""Preps being made"" clearly indicates planning and preparation. ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" indicates a state of readiness for action based on those preparations.
    - References to past actions: No specific past actions/attempts are described, only past planning (""The date was set a while ago"").
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""I'm ready"", ""ready to go"" suggests current readiness to act.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I'm ready to die"" and ""ready for me to go out the way I want"" are clear expressions of desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method/tool/location is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""The date was set a while ago"" indicates a planned timeline. ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"" explicitly states preparations are underway. ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" implies being in a state of readiness for the planned action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current/future intention based on past planning and current readiness.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. It describes planning and being ready, but not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is too low because there is a clear personal desire to die and more than general distress.
    - 'Ideation' is too low because the post explicitly mentions ""Preps being made"" and ""The date was set"", which are clear indications of planning and preparation, not just thoughts or desires.
    - 'Behavior' fits best. There is explicit personal expression of suicidal desire (""I'm ready to die"", ""ready to go"") AND clear mentions of preparations (""Preps being made"", ""The date was set"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go""), which fall under the definition of a plan, method, or preparations.
    - 'Attempt' is incorrect because no specific, initiated, potentially lethal action is described as having occurred. The post describes being ready and having made preparations, not having *acted* on them yet.

I still sleep in class but my teachers now dont care much which i guess is good.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Im thinking of ending my life."" This is a direct statement of suicidal ideation.
    - Emotional indicators: ""hate my course,"" ""friends have all pretty much ditched me,"" ""loner,"" ""depression,"" ""angsty."" These indicate significant distress and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, notes, or goodbyes.
    - References to past actions: Mentions past academic struggles, OCD development, panic attack, lashing out. No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""Im thinking of ending my life"" indicates a current thought, but no specific timeframe is given.
    - Stated desire: The phrase ""Im thinking of ending my life"" clearly expresses a personal desire or consideration to die. It is not presented as an unwanted thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly states ""ending my life,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive.
    - The writer does not explicitly state they do not want these thoughts.
    - This confirms a clear personal expression of suicidal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    - There is a desire to die, but no clear plan, method, or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes past life events (grades, OCD, school issues, friends) and a current intention/thought (""Im thinking of ending my life"").
    - It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. The past events are life struggles, not suicidal acts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""Im thinking of ending my life,"" which is a clear personal expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator' because the intent is personal and explicit, not abstract or unwanted.
    - However, the post does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - The post does not describe any past or very recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan, method, or preparations.

171,its working!. hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""pls let me never wake up"" is a clear desire for death. ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" reinforces the desire for an end to life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, hopelessness, a wish for cessation of life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The key phrase is ""its working!"". This implies that a specific method has been initiated and is currently in progress, leading towards the desired outcome of not waking up. While the *specific* method isn't named, the phrase indicates an active, ongoing, potentially lethal action.
    *   **References to past actions:** No explicit past actions are mentioned, but ""its working!"" refers to a current, ongoing action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""last post on here,"" ""never wake up"" and especially ""its working!"" indicate extreme imminence and an action currently in progress.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A clear and strong desire to die and not be alive.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up"" clearly expresses a desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post indicates a desire to act and that an action is in progress.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? ""its working!"" strongly implies that a method has been initiated and is actively taking effect. This goes beyond merely planning or preparing; it suggests the execution of a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""its working!"" indicates that any necessary preparation has been completed and the action itself is now underway.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *current, ongoing action* (""its working!"") leading to a future outcome (""never wake up"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""its working!"" signifies that a potentially lethal action has been *initiated* and is currently in progress. This aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' which focuses on an initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is clear personal suicidal intent and an active process implied.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there's ideation (""never wake up""), ""its working!"" indicates an action beyond just thoughts or desires.
    *   **Behavior:** This category involves a plan, method, or preparations. While ""its working!"" implies a method, it goes further than just stating a plan or preparation; it suggests the *initiation and ongoing effect* of that plan.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition for 'Attempt' is ""The content describes **past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death**."" The phrase ""its working!"" strongly suggests a *very recent, specific, self-initiated action* that is currently underway and intended to be lethal. This fits the definition of an initiated action, even if the outcome is not yet known. It's not merely a plan; it's the execution of a plan.

Final decision is 'Attempt' due to ""its working!"" implying an initiated, ongoing, potentially lethal action.

175,i cant do this anymore. im going to do it. im in so much pain and i cant handle it anymore. i cant. i cant. im done. thank you to the people i met thru this sub. and i hope everyone finds something to live for.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""im going to do it"" in this context, combined with ""i cant do this anymore"" and ""im done,"" strongly implies suicidal intent to end their life. ""Im done"" also points to ending things.
    - Emotional indicators: ""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im in so much pain and i cant handle it anymore,"" ""i cant. i cant."" indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific plan, method, or tool is mentioned. The ""thank you to the people I met thru this sub"" and ""i hope everyone finds something to live for"" could be interpreted as a farewell, which is a form of preparation, but it's not tied to a specific *method* or *means* of suicide.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""im going to do it"" implies immediate or very near-future intent.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to end their life/suffering.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""im going to do it"" in this context is a very strong and direct expression of intent to die by suicide.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""im going to do it,"" ""im done,"" and ""i cant do this anymore"" clearly convey a desire to end their life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states they *are* going to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The farewell (""thank you to the people I met thru this sub. and i hope everyone finds something to live for"") can be seen as a general preparation (saying goodbye), but it does not specify a *method* or *means*. For 'Behavior', a plan/method/means is required.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""im going to do it"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and a desire to die (""im going to do it"", ""im done""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan, method, or means mentioned (e.g., no pills, gun, bridge, specific action). While the farewell is a preparation, it's not tied to a specific *method* or *means* which is the key differentiator for 'Behavior'. The phrase ""im going to do it"" is strong intent, but lacks the ""how"".
    - There is no description of a past initiated action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear and strong suicidal thoughts and intent without detailing a specific plan or method.

176,What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?. I know that's it's stupid but I've got a lot of stress right now and it would just be a lot easier. I've also never really seen myself going anywhere in life so. why not.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""a lot of stress,"" ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""never really seen myself going anywhere in life"" indicate hopelessness, despair, and a desire for an end to suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post asks ""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"". This is a direct inquiry about a method, which constitutes seeking a plan or method. It's not just a thought, but an active search for *how* to do it.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated, but the question implies a current and active search for a method.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, genuine wish to die (""kill myself,"" ""it would just be a lot easier"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""it would just be a lot easier.""
    - Is the desire negated or unwanted? No, the writer is actively seeking information on how to achieve it.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? The post is *asking* for a ""way to kill myself,"" which is a direct request for a method. While not stating ""I have X method,"" the act of seeking a method is a clear component of planning or identifying a method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention to find a method.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is incorrect because there is explicit personal suicidal intent and a desire to die.
    - 'Ideation' is incorrect because the post goes beyond merely expressing a desire to die. It actively seeks information about a ""way"" (method) to ""kill myself."" This inquiry about a method moves it into the realm of planning.
    - 'Behavior' is appropriate because the post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""it would just be a lot easier"") AND actively seeks information about a specific method (""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?""). This active search for a method constitutes a component of planning.
    - 'Attempt' is incorrect as no past or very recent initiated action is described.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: Yes, ""suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""take the pills,"" ""die."" The post describes the process of dying by overdose in detail.
    - Emotional indicators: The post is cautionary and informative, not expressing personal despair or hopelessness from the author. The tone is a warning to others.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: A method (pills/overdose) is discussed, but not as a personal plan of the author. It's a general discussion of the method's consequences.
    - References to past actions: No past actions by the author are mentioned.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No personal intentions are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer's desire is to inform and warn others about the unpleasant realities of overdose, not to express a personal desire to die. The repeated phrase ""Don't take the pills"" reinforces this.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""end it with pills.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The author is describing the negative consequences of a method for others, not expressing a personal desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The author is not expressing personal suicidal thoughts. They are discussing the topic of suicide methods in a cautionary way.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""pills"" and ""overdosing"" are discussed as methods. However, these are discussed *generically* as a warning to others, not as a plan *by the author*.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes the *consequences* of a hypothetical future action (overdosing) as a warning. It does not describe a past or current intention *by the author*.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post discusses the topic of suicide and a specific method (overdosing/pills).
    - Crucially, the author *does not* express any personal desire to die or suicidal intent. The post is a cautionary message aimed at deterring others from using a particular method by detailing its unpleasant and often non-lethal outcomes.
    - There is no personal expression of ideation, no personal plan, and no mention of a past attempt by the author.
    - This content fits the 'Indicator' definition because it discusses suicide abstractly and lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It's a general discussion/warning about suicide, not a personal cry for help or statement of intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""im positive im gonna do it the the future"" strongly implies suicide. ""no motivation to keep on living"" and ""ill do it when im fed up of this"" reinforce this.
    - Emotional indicators: ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""fed up of this"".
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""im not ready"", ""in the future"", ""when im fed up of this"", ""im good rn"". This indicates a future, non-imminent intent.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to end their life in the future. The only deterrent mentioned is concern for family, not a lack of desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""im positive im gonna do it"" is a very strong implicit statement of suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no motivation to keep on living"" and the stated future intention to ""do it"" (end their life) clearly express this desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, they state they *will* act on them in the future.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""im positive im gonna do it the the future"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this""). It explicitly states ""im not ready"" and ""im good rn"", indicating no current action or immediate intent.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive and a clear future suicidal intent (""im positive im gonna do it"", ""no motivation to keep on living""). This rules out 'Indicator' as there is clear personal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/desire without a plan, method, or preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""fucking hate,"" ""psychologically tortured."" These indicate extreme distress, anger, and suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: The post mentions past neglect (""couldn't even find the time to care for me"") and the act of being born (""having me""), but no past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No intentions are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses deep unhappiness and resentment about their existence and upbringing, describing themselves as ""psychologically tortured."" However, there is no explicit statement of a desire to die or not be alive. The focus is on the pain of living and blaming their parents for it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. While the post describes extreme suffering and resentment about being alive, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or to end their life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of psychological suffering and past parental actions. No suicidal intentions or actions (past or present) are mentioned.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses significant distress, psychological pain, and negative emotions. However, it *lacks* any explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, a plan, a method, preparations, or a past attempt.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit personal expression of a desire to die or suicidal intent. The suffering is clearly stated, but not a wish for death.
    - It does not meet 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' as there are no plans, methods, preparations, or past actions described.
    - Therefore, it best fits 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness, without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent.

I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post describes a dream involving ""mass murdering"" and ""slicing up people."" This is violence and death, but it occurs *within a dream* and is committed by *others*, not the author. There is no mention of the author's own death, suicide, or self-harm.
    - Emotional indicators: The author woke up to a ""severe panic attack,"" felt ""absolutely terrified,"" ""sheer panic,"" and is ""anxious to sleep."" These are strong emotions, but they are reactions to a frightening dream, not indicators of suicidal despair, hopelessness, or a desire to die.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post is about a dream and its emotional impact.
    - References to past actions: The post describes a past *dream* and the author's emotional reaction to it. There are no references to past suicidal actions by the author.
    - Imminence of intentions: No intentions are stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire to understand the dream and ""deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep."" There is no stated desire to die or not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The author expresses fear and anxiety related to a dream, and a desire to cope with that anxiety.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (the dream) and a current emotional state (anxiety about sleeping).
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The described actions were part of a dream and were not self-initiated by the author as a suicidal act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post describes a distressing experience (a vivid, terrifying dream) and the resulting emotional distress (panic, anxiety, fear of sleeping).
    - There is no indication of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, or past attempts by the author. The distress is clearly linked to the dream itself.
    - This fits the definition of 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress and anxiety, but completely lacks any personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It does not meet the criteria for Ideation (no suicidal desire), Behavior (no plan/method), or Attempt (no initiated suicidal action).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""so i can do it"" (referring to ending suffering/life), ""end this suffering"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""fear and despair"", ""suffering"".
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No *current* plan or method. However, it explicitly mentions past actions: ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" ""Overdosed"" is a specific method.
    - References to past actions: ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" This is a direct statement of a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.
    - Imminence: ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" implies a current desire to act, conditional on finding belief. ""end this suffering"" indicates a present desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to end suffering, which implies a desire to die, contingent on finding a reason/strength.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""so i can do it"" and ""end this suffering"" in context, especially with the past overdose, strongly imply suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" and ""a reason to end this suffering"" indicate a desire to end their life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is seeking a reason/strength *to* act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? For *current* intent, no specific plan is mentioned. However, a specific method (""overdosed"") is mentioned in the context of a *past* purposeful act.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No current preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        - Past event: ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" This is a clear description of a past, specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action. The ""on purpose"" part is crucial.
        - Current/future intention: ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it,"" ""end this suffering."" This indicates current ideation and a desire to act.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, the ""on purpose"" overdose fits this definition perfectly.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear current suicidal ideation (""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"", ""end this suffering""). This would lean towards 'Ideation'.
    - However, the post also explicitly describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" The definition of 'Attempt' specifically covers this: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death"".
    - The rule states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The past purposeful overdose is clearly described as an initiated action.
    - Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification due to the explicit mention of a past purposeful overdose.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood,"" ""scared to stress him even more."" Indicates distress and burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. The mention of ""run out of meds"" and ""urgent refill"" refers to a lack of medication, which is a stressor, not a suicidal method or preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I thought I was getting better,"" ""for the past few weeks I've been happy."" No past *suicidal* actions are described, only a past state of improvement.
    *   **Imminence:** ""all of a sudden I'm suicidal again"" indicates a current, active state.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I'm suicidal again"" is a direct, personal statement of current suicidal thoughts/feelings. It is not presented as unwanted thoughts or an abstract concept.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I'm suicidal again.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? ""I'm suicidal again"" implies this desire or a strong inclination towards it.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement ""I'm suicidal again"" is a direct declaration of their current state, not a rejection of unwanted thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The mention of ""run out of meds"" is a contextual factor for their distress, not a plan for suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state (""I'm suicidal again"") following a period of improvement.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly states ""I'm suicidal again,"" which is an explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings. This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (like a specific way to die, tools, or preparing a note). Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated* suicidal action. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   The content perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: Yes, ""suicide by hanging,"" ""tied the noose.""
    - Emotional indicators: Ambivalence (""still not sure""), seeking information about the experience (pain, duration).
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: Yes, ""tied the noose"" is a clear preparation. The method is ""hanging.""
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: No.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Implied by the preparation and the direct question about the experience, suggesting immediate consideration.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: While there's ambivalence (""still not sure""), the act of tying the noose and asking about the experience of hanging strongly implies a current, serious consideration of suicide. The desire is present, even if not fully resolved.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide by hanging.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, by directly discussing ""suicide by hanging"" and having taken a preparatory step. The ambivalence does not negate the underlying intent to consider the act.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively engaging with the idea and a preparatory step.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""hanging"" is the method, and ""noose"" is the tool.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""ive alr tied the noose"" is a clear preparation.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. If there is *any* mention of a method or preparation, it leans towards 'Behavior'. Here, there is a clear method and preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention. ""Tied the noose"" is a completed preparation for a potential future act.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. Tying the noose is a preparation, not an initiated attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a specific method (""hanging""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by mentioning a concrete preparation (""tied the noose""). This rules out 'Ideation'.
    - The post describes a preparation and consideration of a future act, not a past or very recent initiated action that was potentially lethal. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal intent, a specific method, and a preparation (""tied the noose"") fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

185,I'm a pervert. Should I kill myself? I've never done anything wrong or illegal. I'm just a pervert. I can't help my sexual feelings. I want to die because of them.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Should I kill myself?"", ""I want to die"".
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, self-loathing (""I'm a pervert""), distress over unwanted sexual feelings.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The question ""Should I kill myself?"" and the statement ""I want to die"" indicate a current desire and consideration.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire to die (""I want to die"") and a direct question about suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer asks ""Should I kill myself?"" and states ""I want to die,"" indicating a personal desire or consideration for suicide, not just unwanted thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current/future intention (""Should I kill myself?"", ""I want to die"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""Should I kill myself?"") and a desire to not be alive (""I want to die"").
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It's more than just general distress (Indicator) because of the explicit desire to die and mention of ""kill myself"". It's not Behavior because there's no plan/method. It's not Attempt because no action was initiated.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" is present. This is a common euphemism for ending one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with expressions of intense hatred (""i hate my dad,"" ""i hate my family so much,"" ""i hate everything"") and mentions a past trauma (sexual assault by a family member). These indicate significant distress, anger, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** The sexual assault is a past event, but it is not a past suicidal action by the author.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""i just wanna end it"" expresses a current desire, but no specific timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" strongly conveys a personal desire to end their life or current suffering, not merely distress about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly using those exact words.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wanna end it"" clearly expresses a desire to cease existing or end their current state of suffering, which is a strong indicator of suicidal intent.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated without negation or indication that it's an unwanted thought.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there's a clear desire to ""end it"" but no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past trauma and current feelings/desires (""i hate everything i just wanna end it""). The desire to ""end it"" is a current intention.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. There is no mention of an initiated suicidal act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress by expressing a clear, personal desire to ""end it."" This moves it past 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations, which means it does not fit the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'Ideation', as it contains an explicit personal expression of a desire to end their life, without detailing a plan or past action.

187,"Consider going hobo. Hi people. I just want to point out the alternative for anyone on the brink of suicide. There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant. Living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes, begging or stealing to keep fed. Its not a great situation, but on both occasions it was better than the predicaments that preceded it. And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""anyone on the brink of suicide"").
    - Emotional indicators: The author states, ""There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope."" This indicates past distress.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned by the author for themselves. The post describes an *alternative* to suicide (going hobo).
    - References to past actions: The author describes past instances of feeling ""on the brink of suicide"" and how they coped by ""hitting the road and went vagrant."" These past actions were coping mechanisms, not suicidal acts.
    - Imminence: The author states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment,"" and ""it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again."" This indicates no current imminent suicidal intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is offering an alternative to suicide for others and reflecting on their past coping mechanisms. They are not expressing a current desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide"" is mentioned.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The mention of suicide is in the context of offering an alternative for others and reflecting on past times when the author felt ""on the brink,"" but they chose an alternative. The author explicitly states they are ""functional"" currently.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The post implies that in the past, when on the brink, they *did not* act on suicidal thoughts, but instead chose an alternative. The overall tone is one of resilience and offering a coping strategy, not current suicidal intent or distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The methods described (living in squats, begging) are for survival as a vagrant, not for suicide.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past feelings of being ""on the brink"" and past coping actions. It also mentions a future *potential* need for the coping mechanism (""should I ever need it again""). The author explicitly states their current functional state.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The actions described were alternatives to suicide, not suicidal acts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post discusses suicide, but not as a current, personal intent of the author. The author is reflecting on past struggles where they considered suicide but found an alternative, and they are currently functional.
    - There is no current explicit personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent.
    - There are no plans, methods, or preparations for suicide mentioned.
    - There are no descriptions of past initiated suicidal actions.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Indicator' because it discusses suicide abstractly (as a problem for which an alternative is offered) and refers to past distress without expressing current suicidal intent. The author's current state is described as ""functional.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""end it"" is a clear euphemism for ending one's life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""My life has been getting worse,"" ""so lonely,"" ""can't go on anymore,"" ""fucked up my life,"" ""miss being happy."" These indicate severe despair, hopelessness, and anhedonia.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it."" While ""drunk"" isn't a method, it sets the context for the intended action. The phrase ""end it"" is vague regarding method. However, ""I love you all so much 💛"" strongly suggests a farewell message, which is a form of preparation. ""tonight"" indicates imminence.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""tonight""
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to ""end it"" and ""can't go on anymore.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end it"" in this context is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""then end it.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly personal and intended.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? A specific method is not named (e.g., pills, gun, jump). However, the phrase ""I love you all so much 💛"" functions as a farewell, which is a significant sign of preparation.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the farewell message (""I love you all so much 💛"") is a strong sign of preparation. The imminence (""tonight"") also points towards an impending action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention: ""tonight... and then end it.""
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it's a stated future intention, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent (""can't go on anymore,"" ""end it"").
    - Not 'Attempt' because it describes a future intention, not a past initiated action.
    - Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The post expresses a clear desire to die (""Ideation"" criteria met). However, it also includes elements that go beyond mere thoughts/desire. The imminence (""tonight"") combined with the farewell message (""I love you all so much 💛"") indicates preparations are being made or that the act is imminent and a goodbye is being issued. This moves it into the 'Behavior' category, as a farewell is a form of preparation. While a specific method isn't stated, the farewell message is a strong behavioral cue.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""end my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: The question implies a desire to die and a state of despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen."" This specifies substances/methods. The question ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" links these substances directly to a suicidal act and indicates a current consideration of using them.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The question is posed in the present tense, indicating a current consideration of action.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to ""end my life"" and an inquiry into the effectiveness of specific means to achieve this.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""end my life,"" which is a direct phrase for suicide.
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die by asking about the success of a method to end life.
    - No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they are actively inquiring about them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method/substances (""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"") are mentioned in relation to a suicidal act. The user states they *have* the codeine and *access* to ibuprofen, which indicates availability of means.
    - The question about success implies a plan to use these means.
    - This presence of specific means/method leans strongly towards 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""Will I be able to..."").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is incorrect because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and specific means mentioned.
    - 'Ideation' is incorrect because, in addition to explicit suicidal thoughts/desire, specific substances/methods are mentioned, elevating it beyond mere thoughts.
    - 'Behavior' is appropriate because the post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire (""end my life"") AND mentions specific substances/methods (""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"") that are being considered for the act, along with an inquiry about their effectiveness. This fits the definition of having a plan or specific method.
    - 'Attempt' is incorrect as no past or initiated action is described; it's a question about a potential future action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post includes phrases like ""resisting the desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""i fucking cant do this anymore,"" ""i cant live like this for the rest of my life i cant stand being here any other moment,"" ""i cant imagine myslef living another year thisway."" These strongly indicate a desire to end life or not continue living.
    - Emotional indicators: High levels of hopelessness (""failed everything,"" ""wasted it,"" ""ran out of reasons""), despair (""fucking cant do this anymore,"" ""not happy or enjoying anything,"" ""cant stand being here,"" ""suffer everyday""), anhedonia (""not happy or enjoying anythnig""), and feeling misunderstood/isolated (""nobody fucking understands me and tries to help"").
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""resisting the desire to end"" implies a long-standing internal struggle, but not a past *initiated action* that was potentially lethal.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""everyday i ran out of reasons,"" ""cant do this anymore,"" ""cant stand being here any other moment,"" ""cant imagine myslef living another year."" This indicates a current, severe, and ongoing state of distress and a desire for it to end, but no specific immediate action is stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, strong desire to not be alive or to end the current suffering. The writer is expressing an inability to continue living.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""i fucking cant do this anymore,"" ""i cant stand being here any other moment,"" and ""i cant imagine myslef living another year thisway"" clearly convey a desire to end their life or not continue living.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the current sentiment is one of being overwhelmed and unable to continue, indicating a personal desire for it to end.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current intention/state of mind, with a history of ""resisting the desire to end.""
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The post describes thoughts and feelings, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide. It contains clear, personal expressions of a desire to not be alive and an inability to continue living (""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""i fucking cant do this anymore,"" ""i cant stand being here any other moment""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - The explicit personal desire to end life, even without using the word ""suicide,"" makes it stronger than 'Indicator'.

Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The phrasing ""SMI"" (likely Severe Mental Illness) and the question about telling loved ones about eventual suicide suggest profound distress and a personal struggle with suicidal thoughts as a perceived future reality.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** The word ""eventually"" indicates a future, non-immediate timeframe, but still a perceived certainty for the author.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The question ""How do you tell... that you will probably commit suicide eventually?"" implies a personal belief or acceptance of this outcome for themselves, rather than expressing distress about *unwanted* thoughts. It's a personal statement of perceived future suicidal action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""commit suicide.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive?** The phrasing ""you will probably commit suicide eventually"" indicates a personal, future-oriented intent or strong belief about their own suicide. It's not framed as an unwanted thought, but as a probable future event they anticipate for themselves. This constitutes an explicit personal expression of suicidal intent, even if not immediate.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the post does not negate the desire or intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes a future intention (""will probably commit suicide eventually"").
    *   **Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains an explicit personal expression of suicidal intent (""you will probably commit suicide eventually""). This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide, making it stronger than 'Indicator'.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The word ""eventually"" further emphasizes the lack of immediate planning or action.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated attempt.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"" is a direct mention of suicidal thoughts.
    - Emotional indicators: ""losing grip,"" ""stupid financial mistakes,"" ""haunt me,"" ""getting worse,"" ""dont know who to turn to,"" ""can't stop crying,"" ""can't cope with his own mistakes,"" ""Why won't god talk to me?"", ""cry out for him to show me a solution."" These indicate high levels of distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""made some stupid financial mistakes some years ago"" - this refers to the cause of distress, not a past suicidal action.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer states ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself."" This is a clear expression of experiencing suicidal thoughts. This is immediately followed by ""I wanna see my daughters grow up, I can't stop crying,"" which indicates a strong internal conflict and a desire to live, but it does not negate the presence of the suicidal thoughts themselves. The primary sentiment is distress *about* these thoughts and the overall situation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""end myself"" is a direct phrase.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The post expresses the *presence* of suicidal thoughts (""voices... telling me to just end myself""). While there's a conflicting desire to live (""I wanna see my daughters grow up""), the suicidal thoughts are clearly articulated as a current experience of the author. This fits the ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" part of the Ideation definition.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The phrase ""I wanna see my daughters grow up"" implies a desire *not* to act on them, but the core of the statement is that the thoughts are *present* and distressing. This is more than just abstract discussion or a vague feeling; it's a specific, personal experience of suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current struggle with suicidal thoughts (""voices I'm hearing keep telling me"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator', which lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent, or where thoughts are explicitly unwanted and not representing a current desire. Here, the thoughts are present and causing distress, even if there's a conflicting desire to live.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The post clearly fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

193,"a hopeful thought. now that my abusive ex is gone maybe i can find someone who cares enough to look up ways to try to help me with my mental health stuff, or who asks me about how they can help, or who even asks me how i feel about things or my opinions and just. little caring things like that. i hope i can have that one day. and even if i'm by myself for the rest of the life, i can be okay. even if i'm not okay right now. maybe i don't need to die",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" implies that the thought of dying was present, but the author is now expressing a hopeful reconsideration of that thought.
    - Emotional indicators: ""not okay right now,"" but also ""hopeful thought,"" ""hope i can have that one day,"" ""i can be okay."" There's a mix of current distress and future hope.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    - Imminence: No imminence of suicidal action.
    - Stated desire: The post explicitly states ""maybe i don't need to die,"" which is a negation or a strong questioning of a desire to die. The primary sentiment is one of hope for a better future and a desire to live.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" indicates a *lack* of current desire to die, or a hopeful move away from it.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""maybe i don't need to die"" strongly suggests a rejection of the idea of dying.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state (""not okay right now"") and future hope (""hope i can have that one day""). The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" refers to a current re-evaluation of past thoughts.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post acknowledges the presence of thoughts about dying (""maybe i don't need to die""), but the overall tone and explicit phrasing indicate a move *away* from a desire to die. The author is expressing hope for the future and reasons to live.
    - It does not contain a clear, current personal expression of desire to die, which would be required for 'Ideation'.
    - It does not mention any plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe any initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The post expresses general distress (""not okay right now"") and discusses past thoughts about dying, but ultimately conveys a hopeful sentiment and a lack of current desire to die. This fits the definition of 'Indicator' which includes general distress or unwanted thoughts about suicide without a clear, current personal desire to die.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods/means:** ""suicidal thoughts"" are explicitly mentioned. The user asks ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" and refers to ""xanax pills"" as a specific substance/method.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""bored,"" ""just wanna be calm rn.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""taking 3 xanax pills"" is a specific method. ""i will do it anyway"" indicates an intention to act on this method. The question about dying from it directly relates to the lethal potential of this method.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""rn"" (right now) for wanting to be calm and the implied action. ""when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there"" suggests a recurring pattern.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The user explicitly states ""i dont wanna die rn."" However, they also state ""when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there"" and are asking about the lethality of a specific substance they intend to take (""i will do it anyway""). This indicates a complex situation where suicidal thoughts are present, a specific action is intended, and the lethal potential of that action is being directly questioned, even if the primary stated desire is not to die *right now*. The phrase ""what is the worst thing that can happen to me"" further reinforces an awareness of potential negative, possibly lethal, outcomes.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The user explicitly states ""i dont wanna die rn."" This negates a *current desire* to die. However, the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" and the inquiry about the lethality of a specific method they intend to use (""i will do it anyway"") makes this more than just unwanted thoughts. The user is actively considering an action with known suicidal implications (given the ""suicidal thoughts"" context) and directly asking about its lethal potential.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? They state ""i dont wanna die rn"" which negates the *desire* to die, but they explicitly state ""i will do it anyway"" regarding taking the pills, indicating an intention to act. The *thoughts* are present, and a specific *action* is intended, and its lethal potential is being explored.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? Yes, ""3 xanax pills.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""i will do it anyway"" signifies an intention to carry out the action. The question ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" is a direct inquiry into the consequences of this specific method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""i will do it anyway"").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's about a future action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" rules out a pure 'Indicator' which typically lacks clear personal suicidal intent.
    *   While the user states ""i dont wanna die rn,"" the explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" combined with a specific method (""3 xanax pills"") and a clear intention to take them (""i will do it anyway""), along with the direct inquiry about their lethality (""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?""), moves this beyond mere 'Ideation'. 'Ideation' is defined as thoughts/desire *without* a specific plan/method.
    *   This post clearly includes a specific method (""3 xanax pills"") and an intention to act (""i will do it anyway""). The user is exploring the lethal potential of this specific action, even if the stated primary goal isn't death. The context of ""suicidal thoughts"" makes this a high-risk scenario fitting the 'Behavior' definition. The user is engaging with a specific, potentially harmful action linked to their suicidal thoughts.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past initiated action is described.

Therefore, the post describes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method/plan that the user intends to carry out, even if the immediate stated desire is not to die. This fits the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"" - Explicit suicidal intent.
        *   ""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" - Explicit mention of self-harm and actively seeking methods/locations for it.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""shitface,"" ""monster,"" ""human garbage,"" ""don't know what to do at this point,"" ""hurt my friend"" - High levels of self-loathing, despair, guilt, hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The question ""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" is a direct inquiry for a method/location for self-harm, which indicates active planning or preparation for an act of self-injury. The statement ""i will wait until I can kill myself"" indicates a future intention for suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** None related to suicide or self-harm.
    *   **Imminence:** The self-harm question is a current, active search for methods. The suicidal intent is conditional and future-oriented (""i will wait until..."").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to self-harm and a conditional desire to kill themselves.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i will wait until I can kill myself.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as a future intention.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Not a specific method for suicide, but the query ""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" is a direct request for a *method/location* for self-harm. This constitutes seeking means or planning for self-injury, which is a form of behavioral planning.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, actively seeking information about methods/locations for self-harm is a form of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current distress and future intention (""i will wait until I can kill myself""). The self-harm question is a current query for future action.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, there is no description of a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""kill myself""), moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with actively seeking information about methods/locations for self-harm (""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"") fits the definition of 'Behavior'. This is not just ideation; it's a step towards planning or preparing for self-injurious action. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions... a specific method, or preparations being taken."" Asking for ""places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" is a form of seeking a method/location for self-harm, which falls under preparation/planning.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent and the active seeking of methods/locations for self-harm, the post falls into the 'Behavior' category.

    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""soon,"" ""lately"" (strong urge). Indicates current and near-future intent.

    - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    - No specific location is mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Describes a current strong urge and a future intention (""soon"").
    - Does not describe any past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""going to kill myself soon,"" ""wish I wasn't even born""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations (e.g., ""I have the pills,"" ""I'm going to the bridge,"" ""I wrote a note""). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal act. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""plummet to the ground"" (specific method of jumping from height), ""corpse"" (desired outcome of death).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""so tempted,"" ""guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind,"" ""fear...if i end up crippled instead of a corpse."" Shows a strong pull towards the action despite internal conflict and fear of negative consequences (for others, or for self if attempt fails).
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" clearly describes a specific location (""highest floor"") and a specific method (""plummet to the ground"").
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""so tempted to just go"" indicates a current, strong inclination.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer is ""tempted"" to die by jumping, indicating a desire for death, even with expressed reservations about the consequences or failure.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the desire to ""plummet to the ground"" and become a ""corpse"" clearly indicates a desire to die. The ""tempted"" phrasing confirms this is a personal inclination.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post expresses temptation and internal conflict about the *barriers* to acting (guilt, fear of failure), not a negation of the desire to die itself.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""go to the highest floor"" (location) and ""plummet to the ground"" (method) are explicitly mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation beyond the stated intention to go to the location and perform the method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""so tempted to just go"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes a current temptation/consideration, not a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""corpse"") and a strong current temptation towards it. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts or desire by explicitly mentioning a specific method (""plummet to the ground"") and a specific location (""highest floor""). This constitutes a plan, even if there are expressed hesitations or fears about executing it or its outcome. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit mention of a specific method and location in conjunction with a desire to die, the most appropriate category is Behavior.

198,"If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he wont feel that bad if I kill myself. Any thoughts?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""kill myself"" is explicitly used.
    - Emotional indicators: The post suggests distress related to hurting someone (""If I deeply hurt my boyfriend"") and considers suicide as a way to mitigate the perceived negative impact on the boyfriend. This indicates a state of despair or distorted thinking.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: Not explicitly stated as immediate, but it's presented as a current consideration (""Any thoughts?"").
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrasing ""he won't feel that bad if I kill myself"" indicates a personal contemplation of the act, rather than expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts. The writer is seeking input on this specific premise.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The post presents suicide as a conditional consideration (""If I... he won't feel that bad if I kill myself""), implying a personal contemplation of the act as a potential solution or outcome. It's not stated as an unwanted thought.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is asking for ""Any thoughts?"" on the premise, suggesting active consideration.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current contemplation of a future, conditional action.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is not appropriate because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""kill myself"") being considered, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - 'Ideation' fits well. The post contains an explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") and a desire to consider it as a solution, but crucially, it lacks any specific plan, method, or preparations.
    - 'Behavior' is not appropriate because no specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    - 'Attempt' is not appropriate because no past or very recent initiated suicidal action is described.

Based on the explicit mention of ""kill myself"" as a personal consideration, without any specific plan or past action, 'Ideation' is the correct classification.

I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""jump"", ""wanted to die"", ""took their life"" (referring to someone else, but sets context).
    - Emotional indicators: ""can't help it"", ""hoping I'll gain the courage"", ""maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care."" This indicates distress, struggle, and ambivalence, but also a desire for intervention.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage"", ""jump"". This is a very specific location and method. The repeated action of going there and ""trying to work up the nerve"" is a form of preparation and engagement with the plan.
    - References to past actions: The author describes past instances of *standing on the ledge* and *trying to work up the nerve*, but explicitly states they ""can never get the nerve to jump."" This differentiates it from an actual initiated attempt.
    - Imminence: The post describes ongoing, repeated engagement with the specific method/location, indicating a current and persistent struggle with the intent to act.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer states ""I go hoping I'll gain the courage"" to jump, which indicates a desire to die if they can overcome their fear. The desire for someone to stop them highlights ambivalence, but does not negate the primary intent of going there to ""work up the nerve"" to jump.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No direct ""kill myself,"" but ""jump"" from a ledge and ""wanted to die"" clearly convey suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I go hoping I'll gain the courage to jump"" implies a desire to die if the courage is found.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, they state ""I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage,"" which indicates a desire to act despite the struggle.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage"" and ""jump"" are explicit method and location.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, repeatedly going to the specific location and ""trying to work up the nerve"" is a form of preparation and engagement with the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes repeated past instances of going to the ledge and *trying* to jump, and implies a continuing intention to do so (""I go hoping I'll gain the courage"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The post explicitly states, ""I can never get the nerve to jump."" This rules out 'Attempt' because no actual lethal action was initiated.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is clear personal suicidal intent and a specific plan/method.
    - Not 'Ideation' because there is a specific plan/method/location (""ledge,"" ""jump"") and repeated engagement with it (""I go hoping I'll gain the courage"").
    - Not 'Attempt' because the post explicitly states the action (jumping) was *not* initiated (""I can never get the nerve to jump"").
    - This fits 'Behavior' because there is explicit suicidal intent (""hoping I'll gain the courage to jump,"" ""wanted to die"") combined with a specific plan/method (""standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage,"" ""jump"") and repeated engagement with that plan (going there to ""work up the nerve""). The ambivalence and desire for intervention are common in 'Behavior' but do not negate the presence of a plan and intent.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online.

    - **Imminence of any stated intentions:** Not explicitly ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but ""recently I began searching"" indicates current, active engagement with suicidal thoughts and planning.
    - **Assess the writer's stated desire:** ""my death seems to ultimate answer"" and ""searching about ways to kill myself"" indicate a genuine wish to die and act on it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes. ""tried committing suicide,"" ""multiple attempts on my life,"" ""my death seems to ultimate answer,"" ""ways to kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes. ""my death seems to ultimate answer.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; the writer is actively searching for methods.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, for past actions (""phone charger,"" ""rope""). For current, the *act of searching for methods* (""recently I began searching about ways to kill myself"") indicates a planning stage, even if a specific method hasn't been chosen yet.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""searching about ways to kill myself"" is a form of preparation/planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        - Past: ""The first time I tried committing suicide,"" ""I have multiple attempts on my life."" These are clear descriptions of *initiated, potentially lethal actions* in the past.
        - Current/Future: ""my death seems to ultimate answer,"" ""recently I began searching about ways to kill myself."" This indicates current ideation and active planning/seeking of methods.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes. The post explicitly states ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life."" These are concrete, initiated actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear descriptions of past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (""tried committing suicide,"" ""multiple attempts on my life""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - While there is also current ideation and planning/searching for methods (which could fit 'Behavior'), the presence of explicit past attempts takes precedence according to the instructions: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The past actions are clearly described as initiated attempts.
    - Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most fitting classification.

I dont understand why nobody cares about me at all, i show nothing but respect and kindness to them but they just fake everything, then when i figure it out im just more dead inside then if they just told me to stop in the first place. Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""more dead inside"" is metaphorical for emotional numbness, not a literal desire to die. ""Im done with everything"" expresses extreme despair and exhaustion, but is ambiguous regarding suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nobody cares about me,"" ""done trying my best but getting no results""), despair (""more dead inside,"" ""done with everything""), feeling betrayed and played with.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not applicable, no specific suicidal intention stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses profound emotional pain, betrayal, and exhaustion with life's struggles (""done with everything""). However, there is no explicit statement of a desire to die or to commit suicide. The language leans towards a feeling of emotional collapse rather than a direct suicidal wish.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. While ""Im done with everything"" conveys extreme despair, it is not an explicit statement of wanting to die by suicide. It could mean done with the current situation or struggles. ""More dead inside"" is clearly metaphorical.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. This is the case here.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current emotional state.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness. The phrases ""more dead inside"" and ""Im done with everything"" convey extreme emotional pain and exhaustion with life's difficulties.
    - However, it *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or explicit suicidal intent from the author*. There is no direct statement like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't here,"" or ""I'm going to end it all."" The language is ambiguous enough that it could refer to being done with the situation or emotional suffering, rather than life itself.
    - There are no mentions of specific suicidal thoughts (beyond metaphorical ""dead inside""), plans, methods, or past attempts.
    - Therefore, it best fits the definition of **Indicator**: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" The rule ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator"" applies here.

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Key elements: ""I think I can jump off,"" ""jump out of my bedroom window,"" ""Hopefully I can do it soon.""
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: No explicit words, but ""jump off"" from a window clearly implies a suicidal act.
    - Emotional indicators: ""less scary,"" ""getting more courage"" suggests overcoming fear to perform the act. ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicates a desire to complete the act.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        - Method: ""jump off.""
        - Location: ""bedroom window.""
        - Details: ""trees and mud below"" (rationalizing the method).
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""soon"" indicates a near-future intention.
    - Stated desire: The writer expresses a clear desire to perform the act of jumping, implying a desire to end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the clear intent to ""jump off"" a ""bedroom window"" with the hope of doing it ""soon"" indicates a desire to end life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively gaining ""courage"" to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes.
        - Method: ""jump off.""
        - Location: ""bedroom window.""
        - Details: ""trees and mud below"" (part of the plan/method consideration).
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit physical preparation, but the mental preparation (""getting more courage"") and detailed consideration of the method and location constitute a clear planning element.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current intention and future plan (""Hopefully I can do it soon"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes an intention to act in the future.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die through a specific action, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a specific method (""jump off"") and location (""bedroom window""), along with active mental preparation (""getting more courage""). This presence of a concrete plan and method moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    - It describes a current intention and a future plan, not a past initiated action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The explicit mention of a method (""jump off""), a specific location (""bedroom window""), and the intention to carry it out ""soon"" fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

203,"Should I tell my mom about my issues. I know most peoples first reaction is ""yes, having help only makes it better"" but I feel like I don't really have that relationship with her. There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time. It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""writing suicide notes."" This is a direct reference to a suicide-related preparation.
    - Emotional indicators: ""low energy,"" ""depression hits really hard,"" ""hate talking about myself,"" ""waste their time."" Clear signs of distress, hopelessness, and difficulty seeking help.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""writing suicide notes"" is a clear preparation. No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes."" This indicates a recurring or past pattern of engaging in this preparation.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the recurring nature (""sometimes... next thing I know"") suggests it's a current and ongoing risk.
    - Writer's stated desire: The post doesn't explicitly say ""I want to die,"" but the act of ""writing suicide notes"" inherently implies suicidal intent and a desire to die, as it's a preparation for suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? It mentions ""suicide notes,"" which directly links to suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the act of writing suicide notes is a strong indicator of such a desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post describes writing notes as something that happens when depression is severe, without negating the intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method or location.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"" is a definite sign of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a recurring pattern (""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes""), indicating it's a current and ongoing risk.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, writing a note is a preparation, not a potentially lethal *initiated action*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond ""Indicator"" because it describes a specific action related to suicide (writing notes), implying clear suicidal intent.
    - It goes beyond ""Ideation"" because ""writing suicide notes"" is a concrete *preparation* for suicide, not just a thought or desire. The definition of ""Behavior"" includes ""preparations being taken.""
    - It does not describe an *initiated potentially lethal action* (like taking pills or attempting to hang oneself), so it is not ""Attempt.""

Based on the mention of ""writing suicide notes"" as a preparation, the post fits the ""Behavior"" category.

People dying is funny hope that asshole dies hope i die maybe then ill get a good chuckle fuck me fuck da world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""hope i die"". It also mentions ""People dying"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""suffering mentally"", ""no one cares"", ""get all depressed"", ""fuck me fuck da world"".
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not explicitly stated as immediate, but a clear desire.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear wish to die (""hope i die""). While there's a line ""maybe i just need attention yes its all a ruse for attention"", this often accompanies genuine distress and ideation, rather than negating the expressed desire to die. The overall tone and repeated ""fuck me fuck da world"" reinforces the despair and desire for death.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not directly ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""hope i die"" is a clear expression of a desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to die is expressed, not negated. The ""ruse for attention"" line seems like self-deprecation or an attempt to minimize the severity of their feelings, but the explicit desire to die is present.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current mental suffering and a future desire (""hope i die"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""hope i die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator', which lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation to carry out the desire to die. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of any past or very recent initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of explicit personal expressions of a desire to die, without a plan, aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""Just cut"" directly indicates self-harm using a cutting method. ""to deep"" suggests the severity of the cut, implying a significant injury.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Ah."" and ""fuck"" convey distress, pain, or regret related to the action.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""cut"" is a method. The post describes an action that *just occurred*, not a future plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Just cut"" is in the past tense, indicating an action that has very recently taken place.
    *   **Imminence:** ""Just"" emphasizes the very recent nature of the action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is no explicit statement of a desire to die or suicidal intent. The focus is on the action itself and its immediate consequence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No.
    *   While explicit suicidal intent isn't stated, the post describes a concrete self-harm action. The categories allow for actions even without explicit intent if they are potentially lethal.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""cut"" is a method. ""to deep"" describes the severity of the action. This is not a *future plan*, but a description of a completed or ongoing action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *very recent past event*: ""Just cut to deep"".
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes. ""Just cut to deep"" describes a self-initiated action (""cut"") that occurred ""just"" now (very recently) and went ""to deep."" This implies a level of injury that could be considered potentially lethal or at least severe enough to require medical attention, fitting the definition of an initiated, potentially lethal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This is too specific for 'Indicator' as it describes a concrete action, not just general distress or abstract thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** This is not 'Ideation' because it describes an *action*, not just thoughts or a desire to die.
    *   **Behavior:** 'Behavior' refers to *current/future plans, methods, or preparations*. This post describes an *action that has already occurred* (""Just cut""), not a plan for the future.
    *   **Attempt:** The post describes a ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated action by the author that was potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The phrase ""Just cut to deep"" perfectly aligns with this, describing a very recent self-harm action that went beyond a superficial level, implying potential severity and risk.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No direct mentions of the author's own suicidal intent or actions. The post refers to others' comments like ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"", which strongly implies the context is about suicide or severe distress, but these are not the author's own statements of intent.
    - Emotional indicators: Strong anger, frustration, cynicism, and resentment (""tired of,"" ""pathetic,"" ""attention hungry piece of shit""). There's an implied underlying distress (""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: None.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is expressing extreme frustration and anger towards others who offer platitudes in a context where people are likely discussing suicidal feelings. While the underlying context suggests the author might be experiencing suicidal thoughts or deep despair, they do not explicitly state a personal desire to die or suicidal intent. They are reacting to others' comments.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not from the author about themselves.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The author is expressing anger at others' responses, not stating their own desire to die. The phrase ""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice"" hints at personal distress, but it's not an explicit statement of suicidal desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, they don't explicitly mention their own thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current expression of anger and frustration.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress (anger, frustration) and reacts to a context that is clearly related to suicide (""don't do it!"").
    - However, it **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.** The author is complaining about *other people's reactions* to distress, not stating their own desire to die.
    - There are no explicit suicidal thoughts, no plans, methods, or preparations, and no mention of past attempts.
    - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.**"" This aligns perfectly. The post is a strong expression of distress in a suicide-related context, but the author does not explicitly state *their own* suicidal desire or intent.
    - 'Ideation' would require an explicit statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I'm going to end it all,"" which is absent.
    - 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are clearly not applicable.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""i kinda just wanna die"". No specific methods or means.
    - Emotional indicators: ""i dont really know what i want,"" ""struggle to get up,"" ""find everything boring,"" ""friends are the only thing keeping me going and i dont have many since they all left,"" ""get bullied so stopped attending school,"" ""dont have good grades,"" ""idk what i should do haha."" These indicate hopelessness, anhedonia, social isolation, and general distress.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide/self-harm.
    - Imminence of intentions: No imminence stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrase ""i kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time if you get me"" is key. It expresses ambivalence rather than a clear, unequivocal desire to die. The ""but dont at the same time"" negates or significantly qualifies the ""wanna die"" part.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, the desire is explicitly ambivalent (""kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time""). This is not a clear desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""but dont at the same time"" indicates a resistance to or lack of full desire to act on the thought of dying.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current feelings and thoughts.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and some suicidal ideation (""i kinda just wanna die"").
    - However, the crucial qualifier ""but dont at the same time"" indicates a lack of clear, personal desire to die or suicidal intent. This ambivalence means the post ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author,"" which is part of the 'Indicator' definition. It also fits the part of 'Indicator' that says ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die."" The ""but don't at the same time"" implies the thought is not a firm, current personal desire.
    - There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The ambiguity and ambivalence about the desire to die prevent it from being classified as 'Ideation', which requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" The desire here is not explicit or clear.
    - The rule ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator"" applies here.

I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Current/future intention (""I've been having suicidal thoughts,"" ""thinking about partially planning"").
    - No past or very recent initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is clear, personal suicidal intent and desire to die.
    - Not 'Attempt' because no specific, potentially lethal action has been initiated.
    - Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The post explicitly states ""partially planning to die."" The definition of 'Ideation' specifies ""without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned."" The mention of ""planning"" moves this beyond mere ideation into the 'Behavior' category, as it indicates a step towards actualization, even if the plan is not fully formed or specific. The presence of *any* mention of a plan, method, or preparation falls under 'Behavior'.

209,"they took the last bit of stability i have. i just got laid off from my well paying, work from home, low stress, work at your own pace, non-entry level job on wednesday. they took the last bit of stability i have in my life. i live alone because my ex was an abusive pos who i escaped so i have no partner to help keep me afloat till i find something new. i can't rely on my mom because she just lost her job too and im too prideful to tell my dad i don't have a job anymore. i'm also in school which i may have to withdraw from. i lost everything that made me feel comfortable in life in a 5 minute zoom call. i can't ever find a job that pays as much because my role was very specific to the company and is not widely available elsewhere. it's also not something i can use as a marketable skill elsewhere. my life has always been shit but being able to finally support myself was the only thing that made me feel okay about being me. but i guess my ex was right about me, i'm an ugly useless stupid girl who is better off dead. and now its gone. and likely won't come back for years and years and years, if ever. i'm so tired of having everything decent or good in my life taken from me. theres no fucking reason to keep playing this bullshit game. its just struggle and work and work and work and then when you finally get something positive out of life it's ripped away from you. i'm just an ugly 27 year old woman with no degree, no partner, no job, no reason to keep going. ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears. now i really don't care any more. my parents are the reason i have to suffer, why should i care about them? they didnt care about my future to invest in it when they had the means to, why should i care about their emotional state?. i've been thinking i could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself. then i can rest in peace.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""better off dead,"" ""no reason to keep going,"" ""too scared to end it"" (past), ""now i really don't care any more"" (current), ""i've been thinking i could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself,"" ""then i can rest in peace.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hopelessness (""no reason to keep going,"" ""likely won't come back for years and years""), despair (""lost everything,"" ""life has always been shit,"" ""tired of having everything decent or good...taken from me""), worthlessness (""ugly useless stupid girl,"" ""ugly 27 year old woman with no degree, no partner, no job, no reason to keep going"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** Yes.
        *   Method: ""hang myself""
        *   Location/Plan: ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot""
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions past *thoughts* and *fear* of ending it (""ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it""), but not a past *initiated action*.
    *   **Imminence:** The shift from ""too scared to end it"" to ""now i really don't care any more"" combined with ""i've been thinking i could just drive out..."" indicates a current and active consideration of a plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A clear, strong desire to die is expressed (""better off dead,"" ""no reason to keep going,"" ""rest in peace,"" and the detailed plan to end their life).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""end it"" and ""hang myself"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent. ""Better off dead"" and ""no reason to keep going"" also clearly convey a desire to die.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, unequivocally.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite. The writer states ""now i really don't care any more"" indicating a willingness to act on these thoughts, overcoming past fear.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes. The method ""hang myself"" is explicitly stated. The location/plan ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot"" is a clear, specific plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The detailed description of the plan (driving, hiking, finding a spot) and the specific method go beyond mere ideation and indicate a concrete plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past thoughts/fear, and a current/future intention with a specific plan.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The past reference is to *thinking* about ending it and being *scared*, not an *initiated action*. The current content describes *thinking about* and *planning* an action, not having *initiated* it yet.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, it includes a specific method (""hang myself"") and a detailed plan/location (""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot""). This presence of a concrete plan and method rules out 'Ideation'.
    *   The post describes a *current plan* and *intention*, but it does not describe a *past or very recent initiated action* that was potentially lethal. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Based on the explicit personal desire to die *and* the detailed mention of a specific plan and method, the post fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore."" These are direct expressions of a desire for death/non-existence.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I don't enjoy anything,"" ""I am lonely,"" ""I am not healing,"" ""It is terrible."" These indicate anhedonia, loneliness, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post mentions seeking therapy and taking antidepressants, which are coping mechanisms, not suicidal preparations.
    *   References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    *   Imminence: The desire is stated in the present (""I want,"" ""I don't want""), but no specific timeline for action is given.
    *   Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and direct wish to die or not be alive. It is not expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts; it's a direct statement of desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statements are direct expressions of desire, not unwanted thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator', which lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

I'm part of a prestigious grad program for my field, one that I should be proud of and is undeniably an accomplishment. I volunteer regularly with womens groups and lgbtq groups.

People say to wait it out, but its been years. Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts. Its supposed to get better but I just want to know when. I read so many articles and videos and posts about people that have recovered from being suicidal and I just don't get why I'm plagued with this. I'm doing all the same things.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: Yes, ""unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"" are explicitly stated.

    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

    - Imminence of stated intentions: No specific imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is mentioned. The focus is on the chronic nature of the thoughts.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer states ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts."" This indicates a current, personal experience of suicidal thoughts and feelings. While they are trying to get better, the core statement is that they *are* suicidal.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the direct statement ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" expresses this. The struggle is with the persistence of this state, not a rejection of the thoughts themselves as unwanted.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? While the writer describes efforts to get better and fight cognitive distortions, the overarching statement is that they *are* suicidal. The primary sentiment is the enduring presence of these thoughts and feelings, indicating a current personal experience of being suicidal.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, ongoing state (""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal,"" ""Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal,"" ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts""). This clearly goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation to carry out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated action that was potentially lethal. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fucked up self,"" ""depression and anxiety,"" ""scared,"" ""literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and potential anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** None related to suicide. The only ""plan"" is to seek therapy.
    *   **References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** Not applicable, as no suicidal intentions are stated.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states a desire to get therapy to ""fix my fucked up self"" and address their ""depression and anxiety."" There is no stated desire to die or to end their life. The desire is to get help for their current state of distress and lack of motivation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a desire to get help for their current mental health struggles.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of severe distress (""don't even have the motivation to get up anymore"") and a future intention to seek therapy.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and lack of motivation (""depression and anxiety,"" ""fucked up self,"" ""don't even have the motivation to get up anymore"").
    *   However, it *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author*. The author's stated desire is to get therapy to ""fix"" themselves, not to end their life.
    *   There is no mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts.
    *   Based on the definitions, this fits the 'Indicator' category perfectly: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""new suicide method.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can,"" ""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that,"" ""sigh,"" ""i wish i wasn't like this :("". These indicate distress, a struggle against the thoughts, and a clear statement of *not* wanting to die or act on the thoughts.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""eye drops in his beverages"" as a ""new suicide method idea"" that ""didn't give me an idea"" (double negative, meaning it *did* give an idea). So, a method is identified as an idea that came to mind. No preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** None.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states, ""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that."" This is a strong negation of a desire to die or commit suicide. They are expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""new suicide method.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, the opposite is stated: ""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that."" This is a key point.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""eye drops in his beverages"" is mentioned as a ""new suicide method idea.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, while a method idea is present, it is presented in the context of *unwanted* thoughts that the author is trying to suppress, and they explicitly state they do *not* want to act on them. The presence of a method idea alone does not elevate it to 'Behavior' if the desire to die is explicitly negated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current struggle with thoughts and an idea that came to mind. No past or initiated actions are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains ""suicidal thoughts"" and even a ""method idea.""
    *   However, the defining characteristic is the explicit statement: ""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that."" This indicates the thoughts are *unwanted* and the author does *not* have a current personal desire to die or act on these thoughts.
    *   The 'Indicator' definition specifically covers this: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die').""
    *   This post perfectly aligns with the 'Indicator' definition because the author is expressing distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts and explicitly negates any personal desire to act on them, despite the thoughts themselves (and related ideas) being present. It is not 'Ideation' because there is no *desire* to die. It is not 'Behavior' because there is no desire to die *and* a plan. It is not 'Attempt' as no action was taken.

Then sabotaged myself."" This describes a past *plan and preparation* that was *not initiated* but *stopped* by the author themselves.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" suggests a current desire to re-engage with the past plan/intention.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die/act (""free myself of my problems,"" ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"") and a longing for the ""calm"" feeling associated with the plan.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""wrote a suicide note.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm the common denominator in all of my problems,"" ""free myself of my problems,"" ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite; they express a desire to ""coax the feeling back out"" and potentially act on it.

    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""primed and ready to be posted,"" ""Picked a time and place."" While the *exact* method isn't detailed, the extensive planning and preparation (note, time, place) are clearly present.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""primed and ready to be posted,"" ""Planned everything out.""
    *   If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. If there is *any* mention of a method or preparation, it leans towards 'Behavior'. Here, there are clear preparations and planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. It describes a past *plan and preparation* (""A month ago I wrote a suicide note... Planned everything out. Picked a time and place."") and a past *interruption of that plan before initiation* (""Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot""). It also describes a current/future intention to re-engage (""I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out... Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The key phrase is ""Then sabotaged myself"" and ""blocking my own shot."" This explicitly states that the *action was not initiated*. The plan was made, but the act itself was prevented by the author. This differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    *   If a past action is described, was it a concrete suicidal act or just thinking about one? It was a concrete *plan and preparation*, but not a concrete *initiated act*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent and detailed planning.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there are clear mentions of a plan and preparations (""wrote a suicide note,"" ""picked a time and place,"" ""planned everything out""), not just thoughts or desires.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits well. The post describes explicit personal suicidal thoughts/desire (""I'll actually be able to do it this time"") AND mentions a specific plan and preparations (""wrote a suicide note,"" ""planned everything out,"" ""picked a time and place""). The past event was a detailed plan and preparation, which aligns with 'Behavior'. The current sentiment is a desire to re-engage with such a plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The post explicitly states the action was *not initiated* (""Then sabotaged myself,"" ""blocking my own shot""). An 'Attempt' requires a concrete, initiated, potentially lethal action.

The post describes extensive planning and preparation for suicide, and a current desire to re-engage with that plan. While the past plan was not acted upon, the detailed nature of the planning and the current intent to pursue it falls under 'Behavior'.

I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states, ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone."" This is a strong implicit expression of a desire to not be alive or a belief that their absence would be inconsequential, which is a form of suicidal ideation. There are no explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" self-harm, or specific methods/means.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""suffering,"" ""don't feel it will ever end,"" ""utter hell,"" ""alone,"" ""forgotten,"" ""stain upon the world,"" ""crying,"" ""forsaken,"" ""pain,"" ""rotten pit,"" ""outcast,"" ""hanging on by threads,"" ""endless pain,"" ""fading memory."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions past abuse, past attempts to rekindle relationships, past health problems. No mention of past *suicidal* actions.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I am hanging on by threads at this moment."" This suggests a current, fragile state of coping.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" implies a personal desire or contemplation of non-existence. The subsequent sentence, ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain,"" indicates an active struggle against this thought of ""being gone,"" confirming it is a present, personal consideration.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" is a clear, personal expression of feeling that their absence would be unnoticed, which is a form of expressing a desire to not be alive or a belief that their non-existence is preferable/unconsequential.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states, ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain."" This indicates they are actively resisting the impulse or thought of ""being gone,"" but the thought itself is clearly present and personal. This resistance doesn't negate the presence of the suicidal ideation, but rather highlights a struggle with it.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state of intense suffering and a fragile hold on life (""hanging on by threads at this moment"").
    *   It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to not be alive or a belief in the inconsequential nature of their absence (""if I were gone""), coupled with immense despair and a struggle to stay. This goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it directly addresses their own non-existence.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, it does not fit the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it does not fit the definition of 'Attempt'.
    *   The content aligns best with 'Ideation' due to the explicit personal expression of a desire to not be alive (""if I were gone"") and suicidal thoughts (the struggle to ""stay now""), without any concrete plan or action.

I can tell you who to ask and they'll assure you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""want to die,"" ""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm done with life,"" ""all I cause is pain."" (hopelessness, despair, burden)
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""Tuesday,"" ""slit my wrist,"" ""get into my broken car"" (ambiguous but could imply a method like carbon monoxide or crashing), ""hang myself from a tree for my parents to see."" These are specific methods and a timeline.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""So Tuesday"" indicates a specific, near-future intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""all those word just make me want to die,"" ""I'm done with life."" Clear desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""want to die"" and describing specific self-harm methods with lethal intent (""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself"") clearly convey suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""want to die,"" ""I'm done with life.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire and intent are clearly expressed as current and personal.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes.
        - Methods: ""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself.""
        - Tools/Locations: ""wrist"" (implies a cutting tool), ""tree.""
        - Timeframe: ""Tuesday.""
    - Are there signs of preparation? The detailed plan for a specific day with specific methods constitutes a strong indication of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a clear future intention (""So Tuesday, I'm either going to..."").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's a future plan, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""want to die,"" ""I'm done with life""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post not only expresses a desire to die but also includes specific methods (""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself"") and a specific timeline (""Tuesday""). This goes beyond mere 'Ideation' and indicates a plan.
    - The post describes a future plan, not a past initiated action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with specific methods and a timeline fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

217,"Having a lot of suicidal thoughts but I dont think im depressed. Throwaway because people I know, know my main acc. Turned 17 in Jan. Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts,"" ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Everyone dies eventually,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please,"" ""I'm not afraid of death,"" ""suicide is selfish,"" ""next morning I'm dead?"", ""I present to you a dead son,"" ""suicide would be better.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""feel empty,"" ""struggle,"" ""stressing,"" ""not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts."" Despite listing positive life aspects, the core sentiment is a desire for non-existence and a questioning of life's purpose.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. No specific tool, location, substance, or action is described.
    - References to past actions: Mentions a past encounter with a robber, but this is not a suicidal action. No past suicidal actions are described.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No immediate plans or timelines for action are stated. The desire is present, but the author is also listing reasons *not* to act.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear and repeated personal desire to be dead (""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please,"" ""suicide would be better""). The author is struggling with the implications of acting on these thoughts, not stating that the thoughts themselves are unwanted or that they don't want to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""suicide is selfish,"" ""suicide would be better.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses the *desire* to be dead and struggles with the *reasons not to act*, rather than negating the desire itself.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current suicidal thoughts and a current desire for death. The past event (robbery) is irrelevant to suicidal action.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The content aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

218,"Hotline where they can't track me or call the police to come to me?. Last time I called a hotline just to have someone to talk to (didn't have a method or anything), I ended up having the cops called on me and they came to my dorm room and I got stuck in a psych ward for 3 days. It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly uses the word ""suicidal"" (""10x more suicidal"") and refers to ""suicide"" implicitly through the context of hotlines and past psychiatric hospitalization. It explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" for the *past* instance. No current method is mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""worried,"" ""paranoid,"" ""irrational,"" and the core statement ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there."" This indicates significant distress and an increase in suicidal feelings.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned for the *current* situation. The post clarifies that ""didn't have a method or anything"" during the *previous* hotline call.
    - References to past actions: The post describes a past experience of calling a hotline, having police called, and being hospitalized in a psych ward. This is a past *consequence* of seeking help, not a past suicidal action or attempt.
    - Imminence of intentions: The current search for a non-tracking hotline suggests current, ongoing distress and a need to discuss suicidal feelings.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is expressing that they are ""10x more suicidal"" and are seeking a safe way to talk about these feelings without involuntary intervention. This indicates a current struggle with suicidal thoughts or feelings.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""10x more suicidal.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The phrase ""10x more suicidal"" strongly implies a personal struggle with suicidal thoughts and feelings. While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" it signifies a significant increase in the intensity of suicidal ideation. The act of seeking a hotline due to this increased suicidality confirms these thoughts are present and problematic for the author.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is seeking a way to *talk about* being ""10x more suicidal,"" implying they are experiencing these thoughts and need support, not that they are unwanted in the sense of being intrusive and not representing their true desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The post explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" for the previous instance, and no current method is indicated.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (calling a hotline, hospitalization) and a current intention (seeking a hotline *now* due to increased suicidality).
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The past event was calling a hotline and subsequent hospitalization, not a suicidal act. The post clarifies ""didn't have a method or anything"" at that time.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator:** This category is for general distress or unwanted thoughts. The post goes beyond general distress by stating ""10x more suicidal,"" which is a direct, personal expression of increased suicidal feelings. It's not framed as unwanted thoughts that the author doesn't personally endorse.
    - **Ideation:** This category fits well. The post contains ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (""10x more suicidal"") and a clear intent to seek help for these feelings. There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - **Behavior:** This category requires a plan, method, or preparation. None are present in the post for the current situation.
    - **Attempt:** This category requires a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. The post describes a past hospitalization due to a hotline call, not a suicidal attempt. The author explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" at that time.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly indicates current suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan, method, or past attempt.

    - Emotional indicators: ""This is not right"" indicates distress. ""I just want be by myself"" indicates withdrawal or isolation.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The statement is in the present tense, indicating a current state of mind.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to not live anymore.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly those exact words.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I dont want to live anymore"" clearly expresses a desire to not be alive.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a personal feeling, not an unwanted thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current feeling/intention.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit personal expression of a desire to not be alive (""I dont want to live anymore""). This moves it beyond general distress.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.

Then they'll say 'oh why didn't he ask for help' BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT YOU SICK PIECE OF GARBAGE. Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post directly quotes someone saying ""If you are actually suicidal... you would've told no one and just ended it silently."" The author then says ""They won't believe it until I die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme rage, anger, frustration, feeling dismissed, feeling unheard, despair (""trying to fucking hold on to whatever the hell I have left,"" ""I still need help"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Everything I do that has something to do with my feelings I get called out for 'attention seeking.'"" ""BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT"" (referring to asking for help). No past suicidal actions are described.
    *   **Imminence:** No specific temporal markers for a suicidal act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states, ""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP."" This indicates a desire to *live* and get help, rather than a desire to die. The phrase ""They won't believe it until I die"" is a statement of frustration about being dismissed and a projection of a potential tragic outcome due to others' neglect, not a personal declaration of intent to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? ""Suicidal"" is mentioned in a quote from someone else, and ""ended it silently"" (referring to suicide). ""Until I die"" is also present.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The author is expressing extreme anger and frustration at being accused of ""attention seeking"" when they are ""trying to hold on"" and ""still need help."" The phrase ""They won't believe it until I die"" is a statement about the perceived consequence of others' neglect, not a personal desire or intent to die. The primary intent is to express distress and a need for help.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The author's statements ""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP"" strongly imply a desire *not* to die and a struggle to survive.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state of intense emotional distress and a history of being dismissed when seeking help.
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action was initiated in the past or recently.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Attempt:** No past or recent initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Behavior:** No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** This requires an ""explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" While the topic of suicide and death is present, the author explicitly states they are ""trying to hold on"" and ""still need help."" The ""until I die"" statement is a projection of what might happen if they continue to be neglected, not a direct statement of personal desire to die. The core message is a desperate cry for help and validation of their distress.
    *   **Indicator:** The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, anger, and a desperate need for help. It discusses suicide in the context of others' perceptions and as a potential consequence of neglect, but the author's stated desire is to ""hold on"" and get ""help."" This fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and mentions suicide without a clear, current, personal desire to die from the author, and explicitly states a desire to hold on and get help.

Based on the analysis, the author is expressing extreme distress and a need for help, while actively stating they are ""trying to hold on."" The mention of death (""until I die"") is a consequence of others' neglect, not a personal desire to die. This aligns best with 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I feel like killing myself every day,"" ""suicide note,"" ""this might be my final good bye.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""so lonely,"" ""so fucking tired,"" ""no more strenght,"" ""it hurts so much,"" ""sad to say,"" ""dissapointed.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done."" This explicitly states preparations are complete.
    - References to past actions: ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer"" - this refers to past attempts to find meaning in life, not past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: ""this might be my final good bye."" This suggests immediate or very near-future intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to die (""I feel like killing myself,"" ""final good bye"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and ""suicide note.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I feel like killing myself every day,"" ""this might be my final good bye"").
    - The desire is not negated; it is clearly present.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method is mentioned (e.g., pills, gun, bridge).
    - Yes, there are clear signs of preparation: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done."" The mention of a ""suicide note,"" ""bills,"" and ""testament"" being ""all done"" indicates concrete steps taken in preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current state of readiness and a future intention (""this might be my final good bye"").
    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. It describes preparations for a future act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit suicidal intent (""killing myself,"" ""final good bye"") and not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - It's not solely 'Ideation' because, in addition to the desire to die, there are explicit mentions of preparations (""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done""). The presence of preparations moves it beyond just thoughts/desire.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because the post describes preparations for a future act and a current state of readiness, not a past or very recent *initiated action* that was potentially lethal. The phrase ""Everythings ready"" signifies preparation, not an initiated attempt.

Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with clear preparations (suicide note, putting affairs in order) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post repeatedly uses ""kms"" (kill myself), states ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon,"" and mentions ""I can't stop cutting.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm holding it all in and i'm about to explode,"" ""I feel like I can't keep it to myself anymore,"" ""I'm not ok,"" ""I don't know what to do anymore."" These indicate extreme distress and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), location, or preparation (e.g., note writing, acquiring means) is mentioned for the act of ""kms."" ""Cutting"" is mentioned as an ongoing self-harm behavior, but not explicitly as the planned method for suicide.
    - References to past actions: ""I can't stop cutting"" refers to ongoing self-harm. There are no descriptions of past *suicide attempts* (initiated lethal actions).
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""very soon,"" ""about to kms, just not yet though,"" ""kms soon."" This indicates a clear future intention, with a slight delay mentioned (due to the dog).
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear and explicit desire to die and commit suicide (""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon."").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kms"" is used multiple times.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer states they have ""finally accepted"" the fact they are going to kill themselves, indicating a personal desire to act on these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. While ""cutting"" is mentioned, it's presented as an ongoing self-harm behavior, not as the specific *method* for the stated ""kms soon."" The post does not specify *how* the ""kms"" will occur.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of distress and a clear future intention (""very soon,"" ""soon"") to commit suicide.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. ""I can't stop cutting"" is ongoing self-harm, not a past initiated suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""I'm going to kms,"" ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon"").
    - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for carrying out the suicide (e.g., ""how"" they will kms). The mention of ""cutting"" is self-harm, but not detailed as the specific plan for the suicidal act.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicide attempt.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal intent without a specific plan/method.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself even more,"" and mentions ""suicide notes."" Crucially, states ""A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot,"" which is a specific method and indicates immediate desire. Also mentions ""burden of my death.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, anger, defiance (""I don't care,"" ""they deserve to live...with the burden of my death"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** Mentions ""one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash"" (past preparation). Mentions ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" (a specific method being considered/desired in the present moment).
    *   **References to past actions:** ""found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash"" (past preparation, not an attempt).
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" indicates a strong, immediate desire for a method.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** Clear, explicit, and strong desire to die/kill self. No indication of unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself"").
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present and strong.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""shoot myself"" is mentioned as a desired method, even if framed as a wish.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""one of my suicide notes I threw away"" indicates past preparation for suicide.
    *   If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. If there is *any* mention of a method or preparation, it leans towards 'Behavior'. Here, we have both a specific method considered (""shoot myself"") and past preparation (""suicide notes"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. It describes past events (intervention, notes found) and current/future intentions (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot,"" ""they deserve to live...with the burden of my death"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The ""suicide notes"" are preparation, not an initiated lethal action. The ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" is a desire/thought about a method, not an initiated action. Therefore, it's not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself even more""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""shoot myself on the spot"") as something the author wishes they could do immediately, and by referencing past preparations (""suicide notes""). This presence of a specific method and preparation elements classifies it as 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe an initiated, potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The combination of clear suicidal desire and the mention of a specific method and preparation firmly places it in 'Behavior'.

224,"Think I'm going to OD today. I have a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal and idk it's probably not even lethal but I feel like popping all of them at once and hope for the best, I can't feel anything right now and it's all I can think about. Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""OD today"", ""popping all of them at once"", ""suicide"". Specific medications are listed: ""venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""can't feel anything right now"", ""it's all I can think about"".
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""going to OD today"", ""popping all of them at once"", ""a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"". This indicates a specific method (overdose) and the means (specific medications are available).
    - References to past actions: ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"" - this refers to past *thoughts*, not past *actions*.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""going to OD today"" suggests immediate intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""feel like popping all of them at once and hope for the best"" clearly expresses a desire to act on suicidal thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a clear desire to die through the act (""feel like popping all of them at once and hope for the best""). The writer is not expressing distress about *unwanted* thoughts; they are expressing a desire to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""OD"", ""popping all of them at once"") and means (listing specific prescription medications and stating they have ""a month's prescription"") are mentioned. This is a clear plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""going to OD today"").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* in the past or very recently. It describes an intention to act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - Crucially, it includes a specific plan and method (""OD today"" using ""a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal""). This presence of a specific plan/method rules out 'Ideation'.
    - The post describes a future intention, not a past initiated action. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The combination of explicit suicidal intent and a detailed plan/method aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" is a strong euphemism for death, particularly in the context of a farewell message. No explicit mention of suicide or specific methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Sorry,"" ""nothing left,"" ""completely used up,"" ""sorry to anyone I've ever hurt,"" ""thank you to those who brought any light,"" ""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson,"" ""I'm sorry I wasn't a better person."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, and a clear sense of finality and farewell.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method or tool is mentioned. However, the entire post reads as a farewell message or suicide note, which is a form of preparation. The apologies, thanks, and expressions of love are characteristic elements of such a note.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""The end is the only thing that feels right *now*."" This suggests a current, strong desire for an immediate end.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" clearly expresses a desire for life to end. This is not about unwanted thoughts, but a stated preference for ""the end.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" in the context of a farewell message strongly indicates a desire for life to end. The overall tone is one of saying goodbye.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the sentiment is one of acceptance and desire for ""the end.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. The post itself functions as a goodbye message or suicide note, which is a form of preparation. The specific elements (apologies, thanks, expressions of love to specific individuals, sense of finality) strongly align with the definition's example of ""writing my suicide note."" The act of composing and sharing such a message is a preparation for ending one's life.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state and expresses farewells, implying a future action.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it does not describe any initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. It expresses a clear desire for ""the end"" and is structured as a farewell, moving it past 'Indicator'. It clearly fits 'Ideation' due to the explicit personal expression of desire for ""the end.""
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** While no specific *method* is mentioned, the post itself, with its strong farewells and finality, serves as a ""preparation"" (specifically, akin to ""writing my suicide note"" as per the definition's example). The act of writing and posting such a message indicates a step beyond mere thoughts. It's a final communication, a preparation for an implied imminent act. This pushes it into the 'Behavior' category.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No past or initiated action is described, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the presence of strong preparatory elements (the farewell message itself) combined with the desire for ""the end"" leads to 'Behavior'.

Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I was already suicidal"" (explicit mention of suicidal state). ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" (explicit mention of a specific method, ""cutting my god damn throat,"" and a clear desire to end distress/life using it).
    - Emotional indicators: ""feel so bad,"" ""terrible teribble,"" ""mind is going crazy,"" ""incredibly overwhelmed,"" ""don't know what to do,"" ""can't even cry."" (High distress, despair, overwhelm).
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific method. No explicit preparations are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""I was already suicidal and depressed"" refers to a past state, not a past initiated action.
    - Imminence: The desire is current (""all I want to do is...""). No specific timeframe like ""tonight"" but the intensity and immediate desire are clear.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear desire to end thoughts/life via a specific lethal method.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I was already suicidal.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" clearly expresses a desire to end consciousness/life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a strong desire *to* act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation mentioned.
    - The presence of a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat"") is key here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current strong desire/intention. It mentions a past suicidal state but no past *action*.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes a desire and a method, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and a desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - It's not just 'Ideation' because a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat"") is mentioned. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a specific method.""
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent *initiated action* is described. The post expresses a current desire and method, not a completed or interrupted act.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a specific method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill yourself"" but only within the context of a quote the user encountered. There are no emotional indicators from the user about their own state, no personal desire to die, no specific plans, methods, or preparations, and no mention of past actions by the user. The user is simply asking for more information about a quote.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT: The post mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself"" as part of a quote. However, the user themselves does not express a clear personal desire to die or suicidal intent. They are not stating ""I want to kill myself"" but rather ""this quote said 'if you want to kill yourself...'""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION: There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation by the user for themselves.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT: The post describes the user ""stumbling upon"" a quote, which is a past event. It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post discusses suicide, but only abstractly through a quote. The author is not expressing personal suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, a plan, or a past attempt. The core of the post is an inquiry about a quote, not a personal expression of suicidal ideation or intent. This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator' as it discusses suicide abstractly and lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", ""ready to join my dog"", ""i can't do this anymore"". These are strong expressions of a desire to die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""not happy anymore"", ""never been truly happy"", ""difficult"", ""give up on everything"", ""endless loop"", ""life will never get better"", ""accepted that"". These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and anhedonia.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. There is no mention of how the author intends to ""leave earth"" or ""join their dog"". No tools, locations, or specific actions are described.
    - References to past actions: ""i give up on everything in life over and over it's an endless loop of the same life event repeating themselves and i always end up wanting to die"". This describes a recurring *feeling* or *thought* (""wanting to die""), not a past initiated suicidal *action*.
    - Imminence: ""now i'm ready to join my dog"", ""i can't do this anymore"". This suggests a current and strong resolve.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and explicit wish to die/not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words, but ""i want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", and ""ready to join my dog"" are very clear expressions of a desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, absolutely.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly stated as current and accepted (""i've accepted that and now i'm ready"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die but no plan/method/preparation, this points towards 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention/desire (""now i'm ready"", ""i can't do this anymore"") and a recurring past feeling/thought (""always end up wanting to die"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The recurring ""wanting to die"" is a thought/feeling, not a concrete initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""i want to leave earth"", ""ready to join my dog"").
    - It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., how they would ""leave earth"" or ""join their dog""). Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life.

I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" It also mentions ""My grandpa passed away,"" ""losing her father,"" ""loss of a child,"" and ""his passing has saved my life.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author notes their mom is ""doing awful,"" and they ""couldn't add the loss of a child."" They express not wanting to ""make my mother cry the way I saw her cry."" There's a shift in perspective, ""gained a sort of appreciation for my life."" However, they also state, ""Nothing has changed for me,"" which is ambiguous but could imply underlying issues persist.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions a past *intention* (""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit"") but no specific method, tool, location, or preparation (e.g., pills, gun, note).
    *   **References to past actions:** The phrase ""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself"" refers to a past *decision* or *intent*, not a past *initiated action* (like an attempt).
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The past intention was for ""before Christmas."" The current state is that this intention is explicitly *negated* (""Now, I know I can't do that"") and ""saved my life for the time being.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer states a past desire to die (""I was going to kill myself""). However, they explicitly state a *current lack of intent to act* on that desire (""Now, I know I can't do that,"" ""his passing has saved my life for the time being""). While ""Nothing has changed for me"" is present, the stronger, more explicit statements indicate a current pause or negation of suicidal action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I was going to kill myself."" (Past intent)
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? It expresses a *past* desire. Crucially, it then states, ""Now, I know I can't do that,"" which negates the *current* desire to act on that intent.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer explicitly states they ""can't do that"" and that their life was ""saved for the time being,"" indicating a current decision *not* to act on past suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. Only a general past intent with a timeline.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past *intention* (""I was going to kill myself"") and a *current decision to halt* that intention due to external factors (""Now, I know I can't do that. ... saved my life for the time being"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. ""I was going to kill myself"" is a statement of intent, not a description of an initiated action or attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post mentions a past suicidal intent (""I was going to kill myself""). This moves it beyond general distress.
    *   There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past *initiated action* (attempt), only a past *intention*, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The core distinction between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' rests on the *current* personal expression of desire to die. While the author acknowledges a past suicidal intent, they explicitly state, ""Now, I know I can't do that"" and ""his passing has saved my life for the time being."" This indicates a *current lack of intent to act* on suicidal thoughts, even if the underlying issues (""Nothing has changed for me"") might persist. The post's primary message is about *not* acting on suicidal thoughts due to a change in perspective and external circumstances. This fits the 'Indicator' definition: ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" The explicit negation of current intent to act, and the statement about life being ""saved for the time being,"" strongly points to 'Indicator'.

When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, anger, frustration, self-doubt (""Am I faking my depression?"", ""feel like i'm doing it for attention,"" ""feel like i'm faking it,"" ""Am i being dramatic about this?""). Mentions social anxiety and seasonal depression.

While not a *finalized* plan, it indicates active engagement in *finding* a method, which aligns with ""mentions... a specific method, or preparations being taken"" under the 'Behavior' definition. It's more than just a thought; it's an action (research) related to means.
    *   **References to past actions:** Describes past periods of suicidal thoughts (""for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts,"" ""I could have these thoughts for days""). No past *initiated, potentially lethal actions* (attempts) are described.
    *   **Imminence:** No specific imminence is stated.
    *   **Stated desire:** Despite the self-doubt about ""faking,"" the post clearly states a personal desire/intent: ""I had serious thoughts about suicide,"" ""When we fight I always think about suicide,"" and ""actually want to commit suicide."" The self-doubt appears to be about the *validity* of the feelings, not a negation of the desire itself.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire (""actually want to commit suicide"").
    *   The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them; rather, they describe recurring thoughts and actively researching methods. The self-questioning (""Am I faking?"") is about the *reason* for the thoughts, not a rejection of the desire to die. This confirms it's beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   While a specific method is not chosen or detailed, the statement ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"" signifies active engagement in *identifying* a method. This goes beyond mere ideation and leans towards 'Behavior' because it's a step towards planning or preparation (researching means). It is not just thinking ""I want to die,"" but ""I want to die and I am looking into how to do it.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes recurring past thoughts and current/ongoing research related to suicide.
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and desire (""actually want to commit suicide"").
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past initiated, potentially lethal action is described.
    *   The crucial distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is thoughts and desire without a plan/method/preparations. 'Behavior' includes a plan, method, or preparations. The act of ""research[ing] for easy painless ways to kill myself"" constitutes a form of preparation or engagement with finding a method, which pushes it into the 'Behavior' category. It's an action taken towards a potential suicidal act, even if the final method isn't chosen or the plan isn't fully formed.

231,Life is useless. I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being. Death and suicide need to be normalized,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""Life is useless,"" ""Death and suicide need to be normalized."" The desire for a state ""without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being"" implies a desire to escape current existence, which is a form of desiring death or non-existence.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Life is useless"" (hopelessness, despair).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: None.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a clear negative view of life (""Life is useless"") and a desire for a state of non-existence or extreme detachment, along with advocating for the normalization of death and suicide. This indicates a personal desire to not be alive in the current form.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""Death and suicide need to be normalized."" While not ""I want to kill myself,"" the overall sentiment combined with this phrase strongly suggests a personal alignment with suicidal thoughts/desire for non-existence.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the description of a desired state ""without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being"" after stating ""Life is useless"" is a clear expression of wanting to escape life/existence.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite, they advocate for the normalization of suicide.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current feelings and a philosophical stance. No past actions.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses clear hopelessness (""Life is useless"") and a desire for a state of non-existence (""without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being""). The statement ""Death and suicide need to be normalized"" further reinforces the author's alignment with these concepts in a personal context. This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion, indicating a personal desire to not be alive. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - The explicit desire for a different state of being (non-existence) and the normalization of suicide moves it beyond mere 'Indicator'.

    - Mentions of death/dying: ""thought of death,"" ""never feel pain anymore,"" ""to be nothing in a black sea of infinity,"" ""to let go.""
    - Emotional indicators: Expresses a desire for an end to pain and hassle, implying current suffering. The framing of death as ""beautiful"" suggests a strong personal appeal of death as an escape.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not specified, but the contemplation is current.
    - Assesses the writer's stated desire: The writer is clearly expressing a personal desire for the cessation of pain and hassle, which they associate with death, framing it as ""beautiful."" This indicates a desire to not be alive in the current state.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the romanticization of death as an escape from pain and hassle (""To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing..."") strongly implies a desire for this state for the author. It's not abstract; it's a personal reflection on the allure of death.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the thoughts are presented positively and as desirable.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current contemplation and desire.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire for death as an escape from suffering, framing it as ""beautiful."" This goes beyond general distress or abstract thoughts about death and represents a personal desire to not be alive. Therefore, it's more than 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation to act on this desire, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated attempt, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The content aligns best with 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal feelings and a desire for death, without a concrete plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" ""I used to be afraid of death... but not anymore."" ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day."" ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer.""

(High levels of despair, hopelessness, isolation, feeling like a burden).
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" This is a conditional plan. ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day."" This indicates a strong intent to find and use a method, even if the specific one is not yet chosen. It signifies a move beyond just thinking to a commitment to action.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide attempts.
    - Imminence: The decision is tied to getting COVID test results ""tomorrow."" The phrase ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer"" suggests immediate distress and a critical state.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear and explicit desire to die is stated (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself,"" ""as long as i don't see another day"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""as long as i don't see another day"").
    - No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them. On the contrary, they express a clear intent to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a plan is mentioned: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself.""
    - A method is strongly implied by the statement ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day."" While not a *specific* method, this indicates a commitment to finding and utilizing *a* method, which moves it beyond pure ideation into the realm of planning/behavior. It's not just thinking about a method, but stating an intention to use *any* available method.
    - No explicit preparations are mentioned (e.g., writing notes, acquiring specific means).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a future intention, conditional on test results tomorrow.
    - No, it does not describe a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself,"" ""as long as i don't see another day""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere ideation by stating a conditional plan (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"") and, crucially, a commitment to finding and using ""any method"" to achieve this. This commitment to finding and using a method, even if unspecified, indicates a step towards execution, which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'. It's not just a thought, but a stated intent to act using available means.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal act, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent and the stated commitment to using ""any method"" to carry out the suicide, which implies a plan to find and use a means, the classification is 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""kill myself properly,"" ""kill mslef.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Failrure,"" ""burden,"" ""disappointment,"" ""Please help, i have nobody else"" (hopelessness, self-blame, isolation).
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" (specific substance and action).
    - References to past actions: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" clearly describes a past, initiated action.
    - Imminence: The question ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" indicates ongoing suicidal thoughts and desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""What shoul i do kill mslef and stop being a burden"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned, and a clear desire to die is expressed.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - A specific method (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"") is mentioned. However, it's described as a *past action* that failed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past, specific, potentially lethal action: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing."" This was an initiated action, even though it failed.
    - It also describes current ideation/desire (""What shoul i do kill mslef"").
    - The key here is the description of a *past initiated action*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death (e.g., 'I took all my pills last night but my friend found me').""
    - The phrase ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" perfectly fits this definition. It describes a concrete, self-initiated action that was potentially lethal but failed.
    - Even though there is current ideation, the presence of a clearly described past attempt takes precedence for classification.

    - It does not describe a past initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses clear personal suicidal intent (""end it,"" ""goodbye world,"" ""non existent""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It explicitly mentions a specific plan/method (""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil""), which distinguishes it from 'Ideation'.

    *   It also describes a future intention: ""I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

The phrase ""my first failed attempt in October"" fits this definition perfectly.
    *   The rules state: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
    *   Therefore, despite the current ideation and future plan, the presence of a clearly described past attempt makes 'Attempt' the most accurate classification.

The past ""suicide attempt"" is mentioned, but no details of the method are provided, nor are they relevant for *current* risk assessment in terms of plan/method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""one month from my last suicide attempt"") and current positive feelings/lack of suicidal intent.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""my last suicide attempt"" clearly indicates a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that occurred in the past.
    *   If a past action is described, was it a concrete suicidal act or just thinking about one? It was a concrete ""suicide attempt"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post directly refers to a ""last suicide attempt"" which occurred one month prior.
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' explicitly states: ""The content describes **past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death** (e.g., 'I took all my pills last night but my friend found me,' 'I tried to hang myself today but I stopped right before passing out,' 'when I overdosed two years ago'). A concrete, potentially life-threatening action by the author must have been *initiated*.""
    *   This post perfectly matches this definition due to the clear mention of a past ""suicide attempt."" Even though the current sentiment is positive and suicidal thoughts are absent, the presence of a clearly described past attempt dictates the classification.

240,I can't take it anymore. I don't have anyone I can reach out to and it's frustrating to hold my tears. My eyes are burning so bad because I can't sleep anymore. I can't bring myself to do what I enjoy. I tried to go out of the house today and I felt guilty for trying to do something nice for myself. I'm so tired. I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** No explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, or specific methods. However, ""I can't take it anymore"" indicates severe distress. The phrase ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts"" strongly implies that the ""awful thoughts"" are about self-harm or suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""can't take it anymore,"" ""frustrating to hold my tears,"" ""eyes are burning,"" ""can't sleep anymore,"" ""can't bring myself to do what I enjoy"" (anhedonia), ""felt guilty,"" ""so tired,"" ""drowning in these awful thoughts,"" ""so scared."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, anhedonia, and fear.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Explicitly states ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" No methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions related to suicide or self-harm are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** No specific temporal markers for intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The post does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" However, ""I can't take it anymore"" combined with ""drowning in these awful thoughts"" that are implied to be about hurting oneself, indicates a significant level of distress and preoccupation with self-harm/suicidal thoughts. The ""scared"" part suggests the thoughts are distressing and perhaps unwanted, but they are clearly present and overwhelming.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Not explicitly in those words. However, ""I can't take it anymore"" and ""drowning in these awful thoughts"" (which are implied to be about self-harm/suicide due to the subsequent negation of a plan to hurt self) indicate severe distress and the presence of suicidal ideation, even if the person is scared of these thoughts. The thoughts are personal and overwhelming.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The post states ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared."" This suggests the thoughts are unwanted or frightening, and the person is not actively planning. However, the *presence* of these ""awful thoughts"" which are clearly about self-harm (implied by the ""no plan to hurt myself"" clarification) constitutes personal suicidal ideation, even if the person is scared of them or doesn't have a plan. The definition of Ideation includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The post expresses having these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post explicitly states: ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state of distress and current overwhelming thoughts.
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post goes beyond general distress. The phrase ""drowning in these awful thoughts"" combined with the explicit statement ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"" strongly implies that the ""awful thoughts"" are about self-harm or suicide. This signifies the *presence* of personal, overwhelming suicidal thoughts, even if the author is scared of them and has no plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' (""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings""). It is not merely abstract discussion or general distress.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post explicitly states ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" Therefore, it lacks a specific plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No past or very recent initiated actions are described.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly indicates the presence of personal suicidal thoughts (""drowning in these awful thoughts"" which are implicitly about self-harm/suicide), even though the author states they have no plan and are scared. This aligns with 'Ideation'.

241,"I'm so afraid to die but I fucking hate being alive. Yesterday my mom woke me up after work and I was having a dream and after I woke up I felt so fucking angry. I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I'm so afraid to die but I fucking hate being alive."" ""I want to die or reverse time"". ""I haven't died because of the old 'your parents will be sad dummy' thing."" ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time"". ""I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself"" (but explicitly states ""I've never purposely hurt myself""). ""Hopefully the roof collapses or my matress turns into a large mouth and eats me"" (passive death wish, not self-initiated suicide).
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, anhedonia (doesn't want to play games, watch movies, listen to music, work, drive, eat), self-loathing (""I fucking hate myself"", ""pathetic"", ""man baby""), feeling like a burden (implied by ""parents will be sad dummy"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for suicide. The self-harm ideation is explicitly stated as never acted upon and is in imagination. The passive death wishes are not plans.
    - References to past actions: ""I was hospitalized in highschool for depression"" (mental health history, not a suicide attempt). ""I've never purposely hurt myself"" (negates past self-harm actions).
    - Imminence: ""every fucking day all the fucking time"" indicates ongoing thoughts, but no immediate plan.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every fucking day""). They state a reason for *not* acting (""parents will be sad""), but not that they *don't want* the thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying"" are direct expressions of desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, repeatedly (""I want to die"", ""I fucking hate being alive"", ""I think about dying every fucking day"").
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, they state a *reason* for not acting (parents), but the desire to die is clearly present and not negated.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The self-harm thoughts are explicitly not acted upon.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past mental health issues and current, ongoing suicidal ideation.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The author explicitly states ""I've never purposely hurt myself."" The hospitalization was for depression, not an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die and frequent suicidal thoughts (""I want to die,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. The self-harm ideation is explicitly stated as never acted upon. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. The author explicitly states they have never purposely hurt themselves. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" is a direct expression of a desire for death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""hurting,"" ""hurt so bad emotionally,"" ""so depressed,"" ""everything is so exhausting,"" ""my own body is giving up."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. ""Die in my sleep"" is a passive wish for death, not an active plan or method.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""tonight"" indicates a current and immediate desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, explicit wish to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" is a clear expression of a desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a personal hope, not an unwanted thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""Die in my sleep"" is not an active method or plan.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire for a future outcome (""tonight"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations being taken (e.g., specific pills, a specific action, acquiring means, writing a note). The wish to ""die in my sleep"" is a passive desire, not an active plan for suicide. This means it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. This means it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it contains an explicit personal expression of a desire to die, without any specific plan or method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""Zoloft overdose"" and ""wasn't enough to kill me"" clearly indicate suicidal intent and an action taken towards that end.
    - Emotional indicators: While not explicitly stated, the act of attempting an overdose implies significant distress. The current state is described as ""completely fine now apart from slight nausea and I'm really sweaty.""
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"" is a specific method (pills, dosage) and an action taken.
    - References to past actions: Yes, ""at 11:30 I took 6 pills..."" describes a completed past action.
    - Imminence: The action occurred ""at 11:30,"" which is a recent past event.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""wasn't enough to kill me"" explicitly states the desire to die at the time the action was taken.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""wasn't enough to kill me"" is a very strong implicit statement of suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the action taken and the phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" clearly indicate a desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""Zoloft overdose,"" ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg."" This is a specific method and substance.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills is the execution of a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""at 11:30 I took..."").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"" with the clear intent to ""kill me."" This is a concrete, self-initiated action, even if it failed to cause death.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly describes a past, self-initiated action (""took 6 pills"") that was intended to be lethal (""wasn't enough to kill me""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt', which focuses on ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The question about going to the hospital indicates a current concern about the physical consequences of the past action, but the core event described is an initiated suicidal act.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", ""At peace knowing it's soon"", ""Hope my plan works though"", ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"". These phrases strongly indicate suicidal intent and a decision to end life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""chronic stress"", ""hellish trauma"", ""best up the one thing I had going good, my health"", ""severe chronic fatigue syndrome"", ""feel so calm about it"", ""At peace knowing it's soon"". The calmness suggests a resolved decision.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""Hope my plan works though"" explicitly mentions a ""plan"". No specific method or location is detailed, but the existence of a plan is stated.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""it's soon"". This indicates a current and near-future intention.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear and stated desire to die, expressed through ""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", and ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? While not using ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" directly, phrases like ""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"", and ""At peace knowing it's soon"" in context clearly convey a personal desire to die and end their life. Yes.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses feeling ""calm"" and ""at peace"" about their decision, indicating a desire to act on these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""Hope my plan works though"" explicitly states the existence of a ""plan."" This counts as mentioning a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current decision and future intention (""destined to do it"", ""it's soon"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, there is no description of a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up""). This clearly moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly mentions ""my plan"" (""Hope my plan works though""). According to the definition of 'Behavior', this category includes posts that ""also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". Even without a specific method, the explicit mention of a ""plan"" fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Since a ""plan"" is mentioned, it is more specific than 'Ideation'.

Based on the analysis, the explicit mention of a ""plan"" alongside a clear desire to die places it in the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum."" This is a direct reference to suicide. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Hopeless,"" ""felt hopeless for months,"" ""realizing you're hopeless is too much."" These indicate profound despair and hopelessness. ""I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better"" reinforces the depth of despair and a potential lack of desire to continue.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The desire is to *find* a forum, not to execute a plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions, initiated or otherwise, are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No specific temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses profound hopelessness and actively seeks a ""suicide forum,"" which strongly implies a personal desire to engage with or explore suicide for themselves. This is not expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts; rather, it's a stated intent to find a resource related to suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide forum.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the combination of profound hopelessness (""realizing you're hopeless is too much""), rejection of encouragement, and the active seeking of a ""suicide forum"" strongly implies a desire to end their suffering, which is synonymous with a desire to not be alive.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they are seeking out a forum related to suicide.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Conclusion: No clear plan, method, or preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current/future intention to find a forum.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent through the explicit mention of ""suicide forum"" in the context of deep despair and hopelessness, and a rejection of help/encouragement. This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., ""I have pills,"" ""I'm going to X location,"" ""I'm writing a note""). The desire is to *find* a forum, which is a step towards potential planning or gathering information, but not a plan itself. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Based on the explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to not be alive (implied by seeking a suicide forum in this context) but without a plan/method/preparation, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""die"", ""slash my wrists"", ""want an end"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""disgusting to look at"", ""low my expectations"", ""Why couldn't I get even that?"", ""on the verge of trying"", ""idc just want an end"" - indicates self-loathing, hopelessness, despair, and a strong desire to end life.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""slash my wrists"" is a specific method. ""on the verge of trying"" indicates imminence and proximity to action.
    - References to past actions: ""I tried, I guess."" This is vague and does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated. It seems more like a general statement of struggle or trying to cope.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists"" indicates high imminence.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, genuine wish to die (""just want an end"", ""die"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No direct ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""die"" and ""want an end"" in the context of self-harm are clear expressions of intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""just want an end"", ""die"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer states ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die even though I know it's painful idc just want an end,"" indicating a desire to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""slash my wrists"" is a specific method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? ""on the verge of trying"" implies active consideration and near-readiness to execute the method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? The primary focus is on a current/future intention (""on the verge of trying""). The phrase ""I tried, I guess"" is too vague to describe a concrete, potentially lethal past action.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. ""I tried, I guess"" does not meet the criteria for a specific, initiated, potentially lethal action. The post describes an imminent plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die and personal suicidal intent, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It explicitly mentions a specific method (""slash my wrists"") and indicates imminence (""on the verge of trying""), which constitutes a plan or preparation. This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    - It does not describe a *past initiated action* that was potentially lethal. The vague ""I tried, I guess"" is not sufficient for 'Attempt'. The core of the post is about a current, imminent plan.
    - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal desire combined with a specific method/plan and imminence fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

247,how do I tell people my life is not able to be fixed. cause no-one I know has gone through the things I have gone through. they always say life will get better. That is the most bullshit phase I have ever heard. I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone. ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""I cannot wait to die,"" ""at least the pain will all be gone,"" ""funeral costs.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""life is not able to be fixed,"" ""no-one I know has gone through the things I have gone through,"" ""bullshit phase,"" ""pain will all be gone."" (Hopelessness, despair, feeling misunderstood, desire for an end to suffering).
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it."" This is a clear statement of preparation for death.
    - Past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I cannot wait to die"" expresses a strong desire for death.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear, personal desire to die (""I cannot wait to die"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases.
    - Expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I cannot wait to die.""
    - Does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the desire is clearly stated as wanted.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Specific method/tool/substance/location mentioned? No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned.
    - Signs of preparation? Yes, ""ill fix all of the funeral costs."" This is a concrete preparatory action for death.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Describes a past event, current/future intention? Current desire and future preparation.
    - Describes a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated? No, it describes a *preparation* for a future event, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I cannot wait to die""), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a clear mention of preparation for death (""ill fix all of the funeral costs""). This element of preparation, even without a specific method, elevates it beyond simple 'Ideation'.
    - It does not describe an *initiated* potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The combination of explicit desire to die and a preparatory action fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

(Forgive me if I am being egoic / self-indulgent)",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions. The phrase ""what's really the point?"" implies a questioning of existence or purpose.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""life won't ever be as good again,"" ""can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past""), despair (""what's really the point?""), feeling of being ""destined to live a depressed life.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: Refers to past happiness, not past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: Not applicable, no direct suicidal statement.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses profound hopelessness and questions the purpose of life given their perceived future. They are asking for ""wisdom"" regarding this ""dilemma."" While deeply distressed, they do not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I was dead."" The question ""what's really the point?"" is an expression of existential despair rather than a direct statement of suicidal intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, not explicitly. The phrase ""what's really the point?"" in context suggests a loss of purpose and severe despair, which could *lead* to suicidal ideation, but it is not a direct statement of wanting to die. It's a question seeking meaning.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as direct suicidal thoughts aren't stated.
    - Given the ambiguity around a direct desire to die, and the phrasing as a question about ""the point"" of life, it leans towards 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Describes current feelings of despair and a bleak future outlook.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, and profound hopelessness (""life won't ever be as good again,"" ""destined to live a depressed life"").
    - It includes a questioning of the value of life (""what's really the point?""), which is a strong sign of existential despair.
    - However, it *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or explicit suicidal intent* from the author. The phrasing is a question seeking ""wisdom"" about a ""dilemma,"" not a declaration of intent to end life.
    - There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation.
    - There is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - According to the definitions, 'Ideation' requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" While concerning, ""what's really the point?"" is not as explicit as ""I want to die."" The rule states: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" This post fits the 'Indicator' definition due to general distress and questioning of life's purpose without explicit suicidal desire.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""highest chance of death"", ""hopefully everything pans out the way I want"" (implying the success of the suicidal act).
    - Emotional indicators: ""I doubt anyone will answer me but it's worth the shot"" suggests desperation and a final plea, but the core is the intent.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""jump from a bridge"" is a specific method and location type. ""which one do I have the highest chance of death"" indicates seeking specific information for a successful attempt. ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend"" is a clear statement of preparation and a timeline for action.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""by the weekend"" is very imminent.
    - Stated desire: A clear desire to die, expressed through seeking the most effective means to achieve it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No direct use of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""highest chance of death"" in the context of jumping from a bridge is an unambiguous expression of suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""highest chance of death"" and seeking the ""best bet"" for a successful jump.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively planning to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""jump from a bridge"" is a specific method and type of location. The user is asking for specific details to choose a location.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend"" is a clear step in preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""by the weekend"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, this is about a future planned action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and is not just general distress or unwanted thoughts, so it's beyond 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a specific method (""jump from a bridge"") and a clear timeline for selecting a specific location and acting (""pick one by the weekend""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation' because a plan and preparation are present.
    - It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific method and clear steps of preparation/planning (selecting a bridge, timeline) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

Not just them, I just need someone in my life who would see that I am trying, who would see that this is not who I want to be. But this is how it supposed to be, right? I supposed to be an alien, I supposed to suffer. This is my place in the world. I am here to live in pain. I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny, right? Do I deserve it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post states ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free."" This is a statement of being trapped in life and pain, not a desire to die. It's the opposite of expressing a wish for death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""treat me like shit,"" ""suffer,"" ""live in pain,"" ""pain will never loosen it's grip."" These indicate significant despair, hopelessness, and chronic suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not applicable.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire to be ""free"" from pain and suffering, but explicitly states ""I am convinced that I will never die,"" which negates a personal desire for death. The primary sentiment is being trapped in pain.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. In fact, it states ""I am convinced that I will never die,"" which is a statement of being unable to die, not a desire to die. While there's a desire for pain to end, it's not explicitly linked to a desire for death.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned. The statement ""I am convinced that I will never die"" implies a lack of belief in death as an escape, rather than a desire for it.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current feelings and a fatalistic belief about the future.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses profound distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped in pain. However, it explicitly lacks a personal desire to die. The phrase ""I am convinced that I will never die"" indicates a feeling of being unable to escape pain through death, rather than a desire for death itself.
    - According to the definitions:
        - 'Ideation' requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" This is not present; in fact, the opposite is implied regarding death.
        - 'Indicator' states: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.**"" This perfectly matches the post's content. The distress is high, but the suicidal intent is not personally expressed.
    - Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" by the author. It also refers to the sister ""willingly and voluntarily ended her life"" and ""made attempts in the past"" (these are about another person). The author expresses a desire for a ""welcome end to everything"" and finds the ""idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from,"" indicating a desire for permanent non-existence/death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""What's the point?"", ""can't shake the pain,"" ""so much doubt about myself,"" ""doesn't feel that far-fetched,"" ""don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore,"" ""why bother going through all of it?""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for the author's current feelings.
    *   **References to past actions:** Crucially, the author states: ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't."" This is a clear description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence:** The author states, ""But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."" This indicates current ideation.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for death/non-existence (""welcome end,"" ""sleep lasting forever"") but also a stated protective factor (parents).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Not for current intent, but it uses phrases like ""welcome end to everything"" and ""sleep lasting forever"" which convey a desire for death/non-existence.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, as noted above.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer identifies a reason *not* to act (parents) but does not negate the desire for death/non-existence itself.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, not for current intent.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for current intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" This is a concrete, self-initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear current suicidal ideation (""welcome end,"" ""sleep lasting forever"").
    *   However, the most definitive element, according to the definitions, is the explicit mention of a past ""aborted attempt at suicide."" The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death (e.g., 'I took all my pills last night but my friend found me')."" It also clarifies: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The description ""aborted attempt at suicide"" fits this criterion perfectly.
    *   Therefore, despite the presence of current ideation, the past *initiated action* described by the author leads to the 'Attempt' classification.

I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess"" strongly implies a specific suicide method (e.g., cutting wrists in a bathtub to contain blood). The concluding ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You."" functions as a farewell.
    - Emotional indicators: ""disappointment,"" ""nothing,"" ""No hope anymore,"" ""No joy anymore,"" ""No emotion anymore,"" ""The pain in numb now."" These indicate severe hopelessness, anhedonia, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" specifies a location and implies a method. The ""less of a mess"" comment indicates practical consideration for the act. The farewell message is a form of preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I plan on doing it"" indicates a current, active intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I can't continue this disappointment."" and ""I plan on doing it"" clearly indicate a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't continue this disappointment,"" and ""I plan on doing it"" in this context clearly convey a desire to end their life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses clear intent to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""in the tub"" is a specific location, strongly implying a method like cutting wrists or drowning. The ""less of a mess"" comment reinforces this.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the farewell message (""I'm sorry to those who cared about me... Thank You."") is a clear sign of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""I plan on doing it"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes an *intention* to act, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die and personal suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere thoughts/desire by mentioning a specific location/method (""in the tub"") and a clear sign of preparation (the farewell message). This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    - It describes a future plan, not a past or recently initiated action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal desire combined with a specific plan/method (location) and preparation (farewell) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""pain"" (distress, suffering). ""Can someone just hug me please"" (desire for comfort, support). ""I just want the pain to go away"" (desire for relief from suffering).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Implies current distress.
    - Asses the writer's stated desire: The stated desire is for the ""pain to go away,"" which is a general expression of distress and a wish for relief, not an explicit wish to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""I just want the pain to go away"" is a general expression of distress and a desire for relief from suffering. While it *could* be a precursor to suicidal thoughts, it does not explicitly state a desire for death or to not be alive. It's ambiguous.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.
    - Given the ambiguity and the rule ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator,"" this leans towards 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current distress and a plea for comfort/relief.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses general distress and a desire for relief from that distress.
    - It does not contain any explicit personal expression of suicidal intent, a desire to die, or a plan/method.
    - The phrase ""I just want the pain to go away"" is a common expression of emotional suffering and a desire for relief, which does not inherently equate to suicidal ideation without further context or explicit suicidal phrasing.
    - This fits the definition of 'Indicator' which covers general distress, sadness, and hopelessness without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. It lacks the explicit suicidal thoughts/desire required for 'Ideation'. It certainly lacks a plan/method for 'Behavior' or a past initiated action for 'Attempt'.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols.

I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" This is a clear expression of suicidal intent. It details extensive suffering. It mentions ""Taking pain killers and antidepressants... secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self."" This describes self-harm/addiction leading to physical damage, but it's framed as coping/addiction, not a direct suicidal attempt with intent to die.
    - **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, feeling like a failure, being neglected, trauma, loneliness, rejection, physical and mental health issues (epilepsy, body dysmorphia, anorexia, melancholic mind, brain fog, inability to concentrate).
    - **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation for ""ending it"" is mentioned. The paracetamol use is described as a past coping/addiction behavior that caused harm, not a current or past *suicidal method* with intent to die.
    - **References to past actions:** The post describes past experiences of neglect, trauma, bullying, diagnosis of epilepsy, loss of grandfather, rejection of dreams, and the addiction to paracetamol which damaged the liver. The paracetamol use is framed as a coping mechanism and addiction that led to physical harm, not a past *suicidal attempt*.
    - **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""IM GOING TO END IT"" implies a current or future intention, but no specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""soon.""
    - **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire to ""end it."" The post is titled ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end it"" is a very strong and direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is expressing the *reasons why* they *are going to* act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The paracetamol use is described as a past coping mechanism/addiction, not a current or past *suicidal method* with intent to die.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""IM GOING TO END IT"") and provides extensive past context and experiences that lead to this intention.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? The paracetamol misuse and starvation are described as a consequence of addiction and coping, not as an *initiated suicidal action* with the intent to die. The phrasing ""to cope with those racing thoughts"" indicates the primary intent was managing distress, not ending life. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post expresses a clear, personal desire to ""end it,"" not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - **Ideation:** This fits best. There is an explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT,"" ""wanting to end it""). However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for carrying out the suicidal act. The past paracetamol misuse is framed as a coping mechanism/addiction, not a suicidal attempt.
    - **Behavior:** Ruled out. While there is clear suicidal intent, there is no mention of a *specific plan, method, or preparation* for committing suicide.
    - **Attempt:** Ruled out. The past actions (paracetamol misuse, starvation) are described as coping/addiction with physical consequences, not as initiated actions with the intent to die. The post is about the *reasons* for a future intent to ""end it,"" not a past attempt.

Final determination is Ideation due to clear suicidal intent without a stated plan or a past attempt.

My parents found out I have been talking to him online and told me they don't want me talking to him ever again. They also don't trust me anymore and keep on asking what I'm doing on my phone. I really want to fucking kill myself. Not only did I lose my boyfriend, I lost the respect of my parents and I lost my respect for them. I have no one. I was getting over my suicidal thoughts when I was with him, but now they're coming back. I'm thinking about running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head. We both unfollowed each other on social media and deleted our conversations. He said he was crying. I felt like crying. I feel like cutting myself again. Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I really want to fucking kill myself,"" ""lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head,"" ""cutting myself again.""
    - Emotional indicators: Despair (""I have no one""), hopelessness, anger (""Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything."").
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" This is a clear method and location.
    - References to past actions: ""I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts,"" ""I feel like cutting myself again"" (implies past self-harm).
    - Imminence: ""I really want to fucking kill myself"" (current strong desire). ""I'm thinking about running away..."" (current thought about a future action).
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""I really want to fucking kill myself.""
    - Yes, expresses a clear desire to die.
    - The writer expresses a desire to act on the thoughts, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method and location are mentioned: ""lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head"" at ""the train station near my house."" This is a detailed plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""I really want to fucking kill myself,"" ""I'm thinking about running away..."").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* in the past or very recently. While ""cutting myself again"" implies past self-harm, it's not described as a past *suicide attempt* (an action initiated with lethal intent). The train track scenario is a current plan, not a past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses explicit personal suicidal intent (""I really want to fucking kill myself""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond just thoughts/desire by including a specific, detailed plan involving a method and location (""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head""). This moves it past 'Ideation'.
    - It does not describe a past *initiated* suicidal action, so 'Attempt' is not the primary classification. The detailed plan for a future action fits 'Behavior'.

If I am forced to live then put me on a thorazine dri0 so I can be a zombie until the world lets me die.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""wanted to die,"" ""suicide attempts,"" ""kill myself,"" ""not allowed to die,"" ""lets me die.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""medication resilient major depressive disorder,"" ""forced to live""), despair, anhedonia (""only times I have been happy... has been to alter my state of reality""), anger (""jealous and pissed as fuck,"" ""trash"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No *current* specific plan, method, or preparation for a new act is mentioned. The ""thorazine drip"" is a hypothetical desired state of being, not a plan for suicide.
    - References to past actions: Explicitly states, ""I had a few suicide attempts,"" and describes one as ""the most successful attempt involved me being saved."" This is a clear description of past initiated actions.
    - Imminence: No immediate imminence for a new attempt, but a persistent, long-standing desire to die.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear and strong desire to die (""I have wanted to die,"" ""I should be able to kill myself,"" ""until the world lets me die""). They express no regret for past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself,"" and expresses a clear desire to die.
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they express frustration at being prevented from dying and no regret for past attempts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific *current* plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a *new* suicidal act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a long-standing past desire (""Every day for 4,808. I have wanted to die"") and explicitly details *past, initiated, potentially lethal actions*: ""I had a few suicide attempts, i don't regret them, and the most successful attempt involved me being saved..."" This fits the definition of 'Attempt' as it describes concrete, self-initiated actions that were potentially lethal, even if failed or interrupted. While there is also strong current ideation, the explicit description of past attempts is the defining characteristic for this category.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains strong ideation and a clear desire to die.
    - However, the most salient and definitive element, according to the definitions, is the explicit description of ""a few suicide attempts"" and a ""most successful attempt involved me being saved."" This directly matches the 'Attempt' category definition: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The rule also states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""end my own life,"" ""failing,"" ""I'm going to try again.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair (""Nothing in my life feels real""), guilt, pain, anger, shame, self-loathing (""I'm such a fucking loser""), feelings of abandonment and worthlessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" This implies a specific, potentially lethal method, likely an overdose given the ""math is off"" comment. While the exact method isn't named, the description of its characteristics (""easier,"" ""not so easy to back out of"") suggests a concrete plan.
    - References to past actions: ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real."" ""I feel shame for failing."" These clearly indicate past initiated actions (attempts).
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""I'm going to try again,"" ""I think tommorow maybe."" The timeframe is somewhat vague (""Maybe tommorow, maybe next week, maybe next month, maybe next year"") but the intent is firm and ongoing.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/end life, and to act on it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""end my own life.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and to act on it (""I'm going to try again"").
    - No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific type of method is strongly implied: ""this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" The ""math is off"" part suggests a dosage-related method, like an overdose, indicating a specific plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both past events and future intentions.
    - Crucially, it describes *specific, potentially lethal actions* that were initiated in the past: ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real."" and ""I feel shame for failing."" These phrases indicate that the author has previously *acted* on suicidal intent, even if those actions were unsuccessful. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It also includes a clear plan/method for a future attempt, which would typically lead to 'Behavior'.
    - However, the post *also* explicitly describes past, initiated, potentially lethal actions by the author (""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real,"" ""I feel shame for failing""). The definition of 'Attempt' specifically covers ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" Since the post clearly describes past attempts, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification, as per the rule: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""All I want is courage to end it"" strongly implies a desire to end their life. ""It's over"" also contributes to a sense of finality and despair.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Satanic Groundhog day,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No income,"" ""Nothing to do,"" ""Reminded every second of others successes,"" ""No bueno,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""No money will rot your brain.""

    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: The desire is current (""All I want is...""), but contingent on gaining ""courage."" No specific timeline.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire to ""end it,"" which means to end their life. This is not about unwanted thoughts, but a stated wish.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end it"" in this context is a strong, clear euphemism for ending one's life.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""All I want is courage to end it"" expresses a clear desire to end their life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a *desire* for the courage to act, indicating a personal wish to end it.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of despair and a current desire to end their life.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to end their life (""All I want is courage to end it""). This moves it beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific pills, a gun, a location, writing a note). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I'm going out,"" ""going out of this world,"" ""offing myself,"" ""Goodbye world."" ""Offing myself"" is a direct and explicit statement of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm not worth living"" indicates hopelessness and low self-worth.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: The post specifies a precise date and time (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours"") for the action. This is a clear temporal plan. ""Goodbye world"" acts as a farewell, which is a form of preparation. While a specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is not mentioned, the precise timing and farewell constitute elements of a plan and preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The specified date and time indicate a future, planned action.
    - Stated desire: There is a clear and explicit desire to die (""I'm offing myself then"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""offing myself,"" which is a direct phrase for suicide.
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm going out,"" ""going out of this world"").
    - There is no statement negating these thoughts or desires.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - A specific method is not mentioned.
    - However, a specific *time* for the action is stated (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours""), which is a key element of a plan.
    - ""Goodbye world"" is a clear sign of preparation (a farewell note/message).
    - The combination of specific timing and a farewell indicates a concrete plan and preparations.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a future intention (""I'm going out... then"").
    - It does not describe a past, initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""I'm offing myself,"" ""I'm not worth living,"" ""Goodbye world""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere ideation because it includes elements of a plan (specific date and time) and preparation (""Goodbye world""). The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" The specified date/time is a plan element, and ""Goodbye world"" is a preparation.
    - It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""I want to kill myself so bad.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive (""I dont want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefully"").
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them; the desire is clearly expressed as their own.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned in relation to a suicidal act.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - Since there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, this points towards 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current intentions and feelings.
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of these words.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" (feeling like a burden, self-blame, hopelessness), ""can't do this anymore"" (despair, exhaustion), ""upset and pain and hurt I cause"" (guilt, suffering), ""I have to make it stop"" (desire for cessation of pain/existence).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I have to make it stop"" suggests a current, pressing need.
    - Assessed desire: The phrase ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" strongly implies a desire to not be alive, linking their absence to others' happiness. ""I have to make it stop"" in this context points to stopping their existence or the overwhelming pain. This is a clear, personal expression of a desire for cessation of life/existence.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" combined with ""I have to make it stop"" clearly indicates a personal desire for their non-existence as a solution to their pain and perceived burden.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the sentiment is one of wanting to ""make it stop,"" implying a desire to act on the underlying feelings.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of despair and a current/future intention to ""make it stop.""
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) by expressing a clear, personal desire for cessation of existence (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me. I have to make it stop.""). This indicates a personal suicidal intent, even without using explicit suicide terminology.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/feelings or a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I would have done it already"" (implies suicide), ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it"" (implies suicide), ""I don't belong here,"" ""nothing is better than this. It has to be better."" (implies death is better).
    - Emotional indicators: ""lost,"" ""alone,"" ""no one understands me,"" ""hate myself,"" ""make mistakes,"" ""make it everyone's life progressively worse,"" ""can't anymore,"" ""on the edge,"" ""can't do this,"" ""living hell,"" ""unbearable."" (Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, feeling like a burden).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post explicitly states a fear of ""botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital,"" which indicates a lack of a concrete, actionable plan.
    - References to past actions: ""I would have done it already"" is a hypothetical statement about a past desire, not a description of an initiated action. ""I tried going to therapy"" is not a suicidal action.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this."" This suggests current, intense distress and a desire to end it, but no specific timeline or method.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a very clear and strong desire to die or not be alive: ""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge, I just can't do this,"" ""I would have done it already,"" ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it,"" ""I don't belong here,"" ""nothing is better than this. It has to be better.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly using those exact words, but phrases like ""I would have done it already"" and ""if I did it"" are very strong and clear implications of suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, absolutely. ""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge, I just can't do this,"" ""I don't belong here,"" ""nothing is better than this. It has to be better."" This is a clear, personal expression of a desire to end their life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to act, but is held back by fear of failure or consequences, not a lack of desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - The post explicitly states a fear of ""botching it,"" which reinforces the absence of a concrete plan or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire/intention (""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge,"" ""I just can't do this""). The phrase ""I would have done it already"" refers to a hypothetical past action, not an initiated one.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. There is no description of any initiated suicidal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die and clear suicidal intent (""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge,"" ""I would have done it already,"" ""nothing is better than this""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations being taken. The fear of ""botching it"" further confirms the lack of a concrete plan. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated* suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

263,"Ramble about hating myself. Just joined but I have a problem. I'm a 30 year old Male single parent of a 7 about to be 8 year old son. I can afford my bills (barely) but we have food and a roof over our head. But even before he was born I have had depression. I'm sure his mom cheating on me and leaving us 4 years ago didn't help. ( Not doctor diagnosed but I assume do to always been looking at things as glass being empty and not wanting to live.) Now as I'm getting older I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life. Of course I will wait till he's an adult but I just can't seem to get my life together. Every job I have ever wanted I can't get because my experience is in different fields. Females don't like me because of the dad bod. I feel I'm at the point of just no success. I'm over being a failure. But I don't have motivation. I have tried but i just feel like a waste of space. This thing called a life is too much. I would say I'm suicidal but I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that. 11 more years then yes I could be there but for now he just has a non successful dad that he is probably ashamed of. How do I deal with the pain of life. I feel like I'm a failure to my son, my parents, and everyone around me. Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""not wanting to live,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""I would say I'm suicidal,"" ""Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Self-hatred, depression, hopelessness, feeling like a failure, lack of motivation, feeling like a ""waste of space,"" ""pain of life.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal *actions* are described, only past feelings/thoughts.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** Explicitly states ""Of course I will wait till he's an adult"" and ""11 more years then yes I could be there."" This indicates a *lack of immediate intent*.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a desire to ""not want to live"" and being ""comfortable with leaving this life,"" and states ""I would say I'm suicidal."" However, they also state ""I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that."" This indicates a desire to die, but a clear current barrier to acting on it.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I would say I'm suicidal.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""not wanting to live,"" ""more and more comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states they ""don't have the balls to actually do it"" and will wait ""11 more years"" for their son's sake. This is a clear statement against *acting* on the thoughts *currently*, but the desire to die is still present.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past feelings, current feelings of despair and suicidal thoughts, and a very distant future intention (after 11 years).
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""not wanting to live,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""I would say I'm suicidal""). This rules out 'Indicator' which lacks clear personal intent.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific pills, a location, writing a note). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The explicit expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without a plan or past action, fits the definition of 'Ideation'. The statement about waiting 11 years indicates a lack of *immediate* intent to act, but does not negate the presence of suicidal ideation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""I just want off this life"" is a clear expression of a desire to die or not be alive.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Struggling to hold on,"" ""depressed and feeling like shit for years &amp; years"" indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and chronic suffering.
    *   Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past actions: None mentioned.
    *   Imminence: ""Struggling to hold on"" suggests current and ongoing distress, but no specific timeframe for action is given.
    *   Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a genuine wish to die (""I just want off this life"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want off this life"" clearly conveys a desire to die or cease to exist.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as their own.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**

    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it includes a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""I just want off this life"").
    *   It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe any initiated past or very recent potentially lethal action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it aligns with 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive, without a concrete plan or preparations.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I need to kill myself"", ""me killing myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""completely failing school"", ""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore"", ""life just isn't worth it"" (hopelessness, anhedonia, despair). ""terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends"" (concern about being a burden, internal conflict).

    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I need to kill myself"" indicates a strong current desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""I need to kill myself"", ""life just isn't worth it""). The fear of hurting others is a conflicting emotion, but does not negate the stated desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes. ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" is a strong expression of intent to no longer be alive. The context of hopelessness reinforces this.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the post expresses a desire for the struggle to end, implying a desire for death.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:

    - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, feeling burdened by parents' reactions to medical bills.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for a *current* act.
    - References to past actions: ""another attempt"" explicitly indicates a past initiated suicidal action.
    - Imminence: ""I hope I don't make it"" suggests a desire for a current or very near future event to be fatal, but the core context is the reflection on a past attempt.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear wish to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:

    - Are there signs of preparation for a *current* act? No.
    - However, the phrase ""another attempt"" refers to a past initiated action, which is a key element for the 'Attempt' category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""another attempt"") and expresses a current desire related to the outcome of that past event (not surviving it) or a future one.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""another attempt"" directly indicates a past initiated suicidal act. The post is framed around the experience of having made an attempt and the desire for a future one to succeed or for the consequences of a past one to be fatal.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The explicit mention of ""another attempt"" is the defining factor. This directly refers to a past, initiated, potentially lethal action by the author.
    - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes **past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death**... If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""suicide attempt,"" ""vaguely suicidal stuff,"" ""testing my method,"" ""point of no return,"" ""intention of dying,"" ""stopped myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""struggle to not think about,"" ""genuinely bothered me,"" ""weighing on me,"" ""bothering me.""
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: A ""method"" is mentioned, and the actions described (""went until shortly before the point of no return,"" ""went in with the intention of dying"") imply specific, initiated actions using this method. The specific method isn't named, but the *initiation* of a potentially lethal action is clear.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: The entire post revolves around two specific past events where the author initiated a ""method"" with suicidal intent (at least for the second event) and then stopped themselves.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No current or future intentions are stated. The actions are explicitly in the past (""long enough ago,"" ""in the past year or two"").
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: For the second event, the writer explicitly states, ""I went in with the intention of dying."" This indicates a genuine wish to die at that past moment. The current reflection is about categorizing these past actions, not expressing current suicidal desire.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide attempt,"" and ""intention of dying.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, for the second past event, ""I went in with the intention of dying.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post is about reflecting on past actions that involved suicidal intent and initiation.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? A ""method"" is mentioned, and the description ""went until shortly before the point of no return"" and ""stopped myself"" indicates a concrete, physical action was initiated using this method. While the method is not named, the *action* of initiating it is clear.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The initiation of a ""method"" implies preparation, but the focus is on the action itself.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past events exclusively (""Both of these happened long enough ago,"" ""in the past year or two""). There are no current or future suicidal intentions.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes. For the first event, ""I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped."" For the second, ""I went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself."" These are clear descriptions of initiated, potentially lethal actions that were self-interrupted.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post describes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The phrases ""went until shortly before the point of no return"" and ""went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself"" directly align with the definition of an 'Attempt'. The author initiated a potentially lethal act with intent (at least for the second event) and then stopped. This is not merely ideation or planning; it's the description of a concrete action that was initiated.
    - It is not 'Indicator' as there is clear past suicidal intent and initiated action.
    - It is not 'Ideation' as concrete actions were initiated, not just thoughts or desires.
    - It is not 'Behavior' as it describes past, initiated actions, not current or future plans. The 'Attempt' category specifically covers these types of past actions.

Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I really want to die."" It also says, ""Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone."" and questions ""So what do I have to live for?"" and ""What is this pile of shit called life"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness (""never meant to be happy,"" ""nothing ever gets better,"" ""never achieve my goals""), despair, deep-seated anger, betrayal, self-blame (""I am the one ruining my own life afterall""), and a pervasive sense of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge), tools, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** The post details past experiences of bullying and parental abuse. However, it does *not* mention any past *suicidal actions* or attempts.
    *   **Imminence:** The desire to die is stated as a current feeling (""I really want to die""). No specific timeline like ""tonight"" or ""soon"" is given for an action, but the desire is present.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and direct expression of a desire to die (""I really want to die""). This is not distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a personal wish.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""I really want to die"" is a very explicit and personal desire for death.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I really want to die.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to die is stated as a personal and current wish.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Conclusion: There is a clear desire to die, but no indication of a plan, method, or preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past negative life experiences contributing to current despair and a current desire to die.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. There is no mention of any initiated suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, explicit, personal expression of a desire to die (""I really want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' lacks such clear personal intent.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated* suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/desire to die without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""contemplating suicide"", ""looking up how to do it"", ""wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depression ruined a great life"", ""fucking hell"", ""destroys any hope"", ""never ending pit"", ""nightmare"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""jump in front of a car"" (method), ""stab myself"" (method), ""looking up how to do it"" (preparation/research). These are mentioned as desired actions, and research has been conducted.
    *   **References to past actions:** No initiated past actions, only past research (""looking up how to do it"").
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I wish I had the courage"" implies a current desire but a barrier to immediate action, not a definite timeline.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die (""so this nightmare could all be over"") and a clear contemplation of suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""contemplating suicide"".
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself so this nightmare could all be over"" clearly expresses a desire to die to end suffering.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to act, limited by courage.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself"" are specific methods.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""looking up how to do it"" is a form of research or preparation. While the phrase ""I wish I had the courage"" indicates a current barrier to action, the *mention* of specific methods and the *action* of looking up how to do it fits the criteria for 'Behavior' which includes ""a specific method, or preparations being taken."" The definition of Behavior includes examples like ""thinking of overdosing on X pills"" or ""want to jump from Y,"" which are similar to ""I wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current contemplation (""contemplating suicide"") and a desired future action (""I wish I had the courage to jump... or stab myself"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes a *wish* for action and past research, not an initiated attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and contemplate suicide, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning specific methods (""jump in front of a car"", ""stab myself"") and a concrete step of preparation/research (""looking up how to do it""). The presence of these specific elements, even with the ""wish I had the courage"" qualifier, aligns with the 'Behavior' definition which includes mentioning a specific method or preparations. It's not just a general desire to die, but a desire linked to specific means and research.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the post fits the 'Behavior' category due to the explicit desire to die, the mention of specific methods, and the indication of preparation (looking up how to do it).

If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post contains phrases like ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" and ""I want to leave and never come back."" These are clear expressions of a desire to cease existing or die. There is also a wish for a ""nuclear bomb would just kill us all,"" which is a desire for death, but it's a collective, abstract wish, not a personal suicide method.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Nothing Is Beautiful,"" ""so fucking done with this shit,"" ""All my life has been is work, be alone, disappointment and failure""), despair, anger (""Fuck the entire human race""), and feelings of betrayal/distrust.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None for personal suicide. The nuclear bomb is a general wish for collective death, not a personal plan.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: None related to suicide attempts.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No specific temporal markers like ""tonight"" or ""soon"" related to personal suicidal intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to not be alive (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" and ""I want to leave and never come back"" unequivocally express a desire to cease existing.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as personal and wanted (""I want out"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The wish for a nuclear bomb is a general desire for collective death, not a personal method for suicide.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire to not be alive.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die or not be alive (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad""). This moves it beyond general distress (Indicator).
    - However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out these feelings. The nuclear bomb wish is a general, abstract desire for collective death, not a personal suicide plan. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The content fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer, without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""It will all be done after I die,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I'm just going to pull the trigger.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""so much pressure from my skin color"" indicates distress and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods: ""pull the trigger"" is a specific method (implying a gun).
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" suggests a current, immediate intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear and explicit desire to die (""I want to die"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to die.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    - No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""pull the trigger"" clearly implies using a gun.
    - No explicit signs of preparation beyond the stated intent and method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""I'm just going to pull the trigger"").
    - It does not describe a past or very recent specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit personal expression of a desire to die (""I want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post also mentions a specific method (""pull the trigger""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation' and into 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts/desire *and* a specific method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free."" This is a clear expression of a desire for death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""I hurt myself,"" ""I couldn't hide my pain,"" ""tired of putting a mask on,"" ""tired all the time."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and emotional exhaustion.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned for a future suicidal act.
    - References to past actions: ""I hurt myself two months ago."" This describes a past act of self-harm. The phrase ""I don't know why"" adds ambiguity regarding the specific suicidal intent at that time, though it clearly indicates distress. The wounds are visible (""forearms with my wounds are visible"").
    - Imminence: No specific imminence for a suicidal act.
    - Assessed desire: There is a genuine wish for death as an escape (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" expresses a clear desire for death as a solution to suffering.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire for death is presented as a solution.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation for a *future* suicidal act.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. It describes a past self-harm event (""I hurt myself two months ago"") and a current desire for death (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? The phrase ""I hurt myself"" describes a past action. However, the post does not specify the method or severity of the self-harm to confirm if it was ""potentially lethal"" or intended as a suicidal act. Self-harm (Non-Suicidal Self-Injury, NSSI) is distinct from a suicide attempt, though it can be a risk factor. Without more information, it is ambiguous whether this past act was a *suicidal attempt* (i.e., intended to be lethal). The phrase ""I don't know why"" further complicates classifying it as a clear suicidal attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire for death (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""). This goes beyond general distress and indicates suicidal intent, moving it past 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for a *future* suicidal act. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - The mention of ""I hurt myself two months ago"" is a past action. For it to be classified as 'Attempt', it must be a ""specific, self-initiated action... that was potentially lethal."" The description ""I hurt myself"" is not specific enough to confirm lethality or explicit suicidal intent at that time, especially with the ""I don't know why"" qualifier. While self-harm is serious, not all self-harm is a suicide attempt. Given the ambiguity of the past action's suicidal intent/lethality, and the clear presence of *current* suicidal ideation, the current state takes precedence if the past action is not definitively an 'Attempt'. The primary, unambiguous suicidal element is the current desire for death.
    - Therefore, the most fitting category is 'Ideation' due to the explicit personal expression of a desire to die, without a specific plan.

I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much. At the same time, this is so much to carry alone, it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone. It's too much. I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" ""suicide,"" ""detailed plans in my journal"" (implying suicide plans), and ""conversations with myself about suicide.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""alone,"" ""sad all the time,"" ""too much to carry alone,"" ""wish I could tell someone this."" Expresses a strong desire for ""help and to get better.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** ""I write detailed plans in my journal"" is mentioned. However, no specific method, tool, or location is described. The plans are *in a journal*, not being physically prepared for.
    *   **References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""Everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get,"" ""seriously consider it only once a week or so."" No immediate imminence for action is stated.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** This is crucial. The writer states: ""But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did."" This is a clear negation of intent to act. The primary desire is ""More than anything I want help and to get better"" and to ""tell someone about all of this"" without being hospitalized. The distress is about *having* these thoughts and plans, not a desire to act on them.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal,"" ""suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. While suicidal thoughts are present, the writer explicitly states, ""I know I would never do it."" The desire is to *get help* and *get better*, not to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I know I would never do it."" This indicates the thoughts are unwanted and not representative of a current desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method, tool, or location is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I write detailed plans in my journal"" is a sign of *conceptual* planning or processing of thoughts, but it is not a physical preparation for an imminent act. The plans exist *in a journal*, not in physical reality or active acquisition of means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings, ongoing thoughts, and the act of writing plans in a journal.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The presence of ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" thoughts, along with ""detailed plans in my journal,"" might initially suggest Ideation or Behavior.
    *   However, the critical element is the writer's explicit negation of intent: ""But I know I would never do it."" This statement, coupled with the strong desire for ""help and to get better,"" indicates that the suicidal thoughts and plans are experienced as distressing and unwanted, rather than representing a current personal desire to die or to act.
    *   The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The post clearly fits this description, as the writer is expressing distress about having these thoughts and plans, but explicitly states they would not act on them. The ""detailed plans"" are a manifestation of the intrusive, unwanted thoughts, not active preparation for an intended act.
    *   'Ideation' requires an ""explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" The desire to die is explicitly negated here.
    *   'Behavior' requires a ""desire to die AND also mentions... a plan... or preparations."" The desire to die is absent/negated.
    *   'Attempt' requires a past initiated action, which is not present.
    *   Therefore, despite the mention of ""detailed plans,"" the explicit negation of intent to act and the focus on seeking help places this post in the 'Indicator' category, as the primary sentiment is distress over unwanted thoughts and a desire for support.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""The pain is unreal."" These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Expresses a current state of being overwhelmed, but not a specific imminent suicidal action.
    - Assesses the writer's stated desire: Expresses profound pain and inability to cope, but *not* an explicit desire to die or suicidal intent. It's a statement of distress.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. While ""I can't take it anymore"" conveys extreme distress, it does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't here.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. This post falls into this category due to the lack of explicit suicidal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Describes a current feeling/state of being.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out as there is no description of a past initiated action.
    - 'Behavior' is ruled out as there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation.
    - 'Ideation' requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" The post expresses intense pain and distress (""I can't take it anymore,"" ""The pain is unreal""), but it does *not* explicitly state a desire to die, to end their life, or specific suicidal thoughts. It's a general cry of distress.
    - 'Indicator' is defined as expressing ""general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.**"" The post fits this definition perfectly. The phrase ""I can't take it anymore"" is a strong expression of distress, but not explicit suicidal intent. The rule also states, ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""committing suicide.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The tone is dark and sarcastic, linking sobriety (from AA) to the *capability* of committing suicide, suggesting a profound and perhaps twisted sense of despair or intent.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun), or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The statement focuses on the *capability* rather than the *how*.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are described.
    *   **Imminence:** No specific imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober"" indicates a personal, current assessment of their ability to act on suicidal thoughts. It's not expressing distress about *unwanted* thoughts; it's a statement about a perceived personal readiness or capability to die by suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""commiting suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober"" strongly implies a personal desire or at least a serious consideration/intent to die by suicide, framed as a newfound capability.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement implies a *readiness* or *capability* to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there is a clear expression of suicidal intent/capability but no explicit plan, method, or preparation, this leans towards 'Ideation'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current perceived capability/intention.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. It's about a perceived *capability* to act, not an initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal, current intention or capability related to suicide (""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., ""how,"" ""where,"" ""with what""). This prevents it from being classified as 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""I just want tit to be over"" and ""I wasn't to be down"" (interpreted as ""I want to be done"" or ""I want to be gone/dead"") strongly imply a desire for life to end.
    - Emotional indicators: ""drunk because I'm a piece of shit,"" ""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I don't want to be alone any more,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" ""I'm sick and tired."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and exhaustion.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated with a timeframe, but the distress is clearly current and overwhelming.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrases ""I just want tit to be over"" and ""I wasn't to be down"" (interpreted as ""I want to be done/gone/dead"") express a clear desire for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want tit to be over"" and ""I wasn't to be down"" (interpreted as ""I want to be done/gone/dead"") strongly convey a desire for cessation of existence.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post expresses a desire for ""it to be over,"" not distress about unwanted thoughts.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. In this case, the desire to be ""over"" or ""down"" (gone) is clearly expressed and not negated.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire for life to end.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive (""I just want tit to be over,"" ""I wasn't to be down"" interpreted as ""I want to be gone/dead""). This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion, placing it in 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations, which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, distinguishing it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" and ""I will use my suicide"".
    - Emotional indicators: The user expresses a strong, disturbing intent (""existential terrorist,"" ""disturb people for my own satisfaction,"" ""hate capitalism"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific new plan, method, or preparation for a *future* act is mentioned. The statement ""I will use my suicide"" is a general intent, not a specific plan.
    - References to past actions: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" is a direct reference to multiple past, initiated, potentially lethal actions.
    - Imminence: No specific imminence for a new act is stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a clear desire to die by suicide in the future, framed as a means to disturb others.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times and states ""I will use my suicide,"" indicating a clear desire to die by suicide.
    - The writer does not negate these thoughts or state they are unwanted; rather, they are embraced and framed with a specific purpose.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned for a *future* suicidal act. No signs of preparation for a new act are present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both past events (""I have attempted suicide 11 times"") and a future intention (""I will use my suicide"").
    - Crucially, it describes *specific, potentially lethal actions* that were initiated in the past (""attempted suicide 11 times""). This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The most prominent and definitive element in the post is the explicit statement of past suicide attempts: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times.""
    - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" This perfectly matches the first sentence of the post.
    - The rules also state: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The past action is clearly described.
    - While there is also current ideation/intent (""I will use my suicide""), the presence of explicit past attempts takes precedence for classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/suicide: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""bottom of hell,"" ""bad break up that really messed me up,"" ""fell into depression,"" ""flunked college,"" ""fired,"" ""lonely,"" ""no real friends anymore,"" ""most fucked up thing,"" ""given up completely,"" ""want the pain to end,"" ""don't recognise myself any more."" These indicate severe despair, hopelessness, and a desire for suffering to cease.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned for a *current* or *future* act.
    - References to past actions: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This is a direct statement of past initiated actions.
    - Imminence: The statement ""I just want the pain to end"" indicates current distress and a desire for cessation, but the most concrete action described is past.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I just want the pain to end"" implies a desire to die to escape suffering.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"" is explicit.
    - Yes, ""I just want the pain to end"" expresses a clear desire for cessation of suffering, which in this context implies a desire to not be alive.
    - The writer does not negate these thoughts; rather, they express deep despair and past actions.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a *current* or *future* suicidal act. The mention of ""tried to kill myself"" refers to past actions without detailing the methods.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes past events (""bad break up 2 years ago,"" ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"") and current feelings/state (""I've just given up completely,"" ""I just want the pain to end,"" ""I don't recognise myself any more"").
    - Crucially, it describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This is a clear statement of initiated suicidal acts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""
    - While there is clear current ideation (""I just want the pain to end,"" ""given up completely""), the presence of described past *initiated actions* makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate category as per the instructions: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Yes. ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death."" ""I don't want my head to explode via shotgun..."" ""...if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth."" ""I've looked into other options..."" ""Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed..."" ""A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate."" ""my body is continuously accompanied by death."" ""End it now.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""in hell,"" ""so alone,"" ""painful feeling of inability to connect,"" ""sadder,"" ""terribly scared,"" ""depression,"" ""physical pain,"" ""high anxiety,"" ""It doesn't get better,"" ""never ending pain."" Shows extreme hopelessness, despair, and fear.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** Yes. Mentions ""shotgun,"" ""handguns,"" ""overdosing"" as methods. Specifies ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth."" Mentions ""I've looked into other options,"" indicating research/planning for methods. No explicit preparation like notes, but the detailed consideration of methods serves a similar function.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions Mark Linkous's overdose, but this is an external example, not the author's own past action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""End it now"" suggests a current, immediate desire to act.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die, despite fear of the process (""terribly scared of how to accomplish death""). Not expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts; rather, they are actively contemplating how to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide"" is mentioned (""A failed suicide...""), and ""shooting myself"" implies ""kill myself."" ""End it now"" is a direct expression of desire to die.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death,"" ""End it now.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively considering methods and expressing a desire to die, despite fear of the process itself.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes. Methods include ""shotgun,"" ""handguns,"" ""overdosing."" A specific action is described: ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I've looked into other options"" indicates research into methods, which is a form of preparation/planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current/future intention. The detailed discussion of methods and fear of ""how to accomplish death"" points to current contemplation and future intent.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The post discusses *considering* methods and the *fear* of attempting, but does not describe an *initiated action* by the author. The Mark Linkous reference is an external example.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes far beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide (ruling out 'Indicator').
    *   It expresses a clear personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, but crucially, it also discusses specific methods (""shotgun,"" ""handguns,"" ""overdosing"") and a detailed potential action (""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth""), along with research into options (""I've looked into other options""). This detailed consideration of *how* to die, including specific means, elevates it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe any past or very recent *initiated action* by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit personal desire to die, combined with the detailed discussion of specific methods and means, and research into options, the post best fits the 'Behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""never ever wake up"" implies a desire for an end to life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Can't do any of it!"" (hopelessness, despair, feeling overwhelmed), ""Just don't want this anymore"" (despair, desire for cessation of suffering).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. ""Sleep and never wake up"" is a desired outcome, not a method or plan.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the desire is present and current.
    - Assessed desire: The writer expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" clearly indicates a desire for cessation of life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as personal and current. This points towards 'Ideation'.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""Sleep and never wake up"" is the desired outcome, not a specific method of achieving it.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there's no plan/method/preparation, this rules out 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention (""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.
    - This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to not be alive (""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"") and feelings of hopelessness (""Can't do any of it! Just don't want this anymore""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it is an ""explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    - It does not contain any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe any initiated past action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - It is more than just general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a clear personal desire to cease existing, so it's not 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""I want to die"" is stated twice.
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""so tired of everything,"" ""Tired of pretending, tired of lying, tied of being scared,"" ""What's the point."" These indicate significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and exhaustion.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the desire is current.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, explicit desire to die (""I want to die""). The ""but I'm scared"" indicates internal conflict but does not negate the desire itself. The plea for help (""Can someone please help me work out what to do"") indicates distress and a potential openness to intervention, but it doesn't change the underlying desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I want to die"" is a direct and clear expression of suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"" is stated clearly and repeatedly.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to die, even if they are scared of the act itself. The fear is about the process, not a negation of the desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator:** No, because there is a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die (""I want to die""), which goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - **Ideation:** Yes, the post includes an explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive (""I want to die""). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned.
    - **Behavior:** No, because no specific plan, method, or preparations are mentioned.
    - **Attempt:** No, because no past or very recent initiated suicidal action is described.

The post clearly expresses a desire to die without any mention of a plan, method, or past attempt. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I can't stop thinking about suicide,"" ""end it,"" ""suffer till I end it,"" ""where I'll attempt.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""not ok,"" ""cry about it,"" ""suffering emotionally,"" ""hopeless,"" ""will never be ok.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have a plan,"" ""I know where I'll attempt, I know how, I know what I need, I know how and when I can run away from home."" ""It must be a Tuesday to run away."" This explicitly indicates the existence of a plan, method, location, and means.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The mention of ""Tuesday to run away"" suggests a future, specific timeline for the plan.
    - Writer's stated desire: There's a clear desire to end suffering through suicide, despite some stated ambivalence (""idk if I should do it"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and phrases like ""end it,"" ""where I'll attempt,"" clearly expressing a personal desire to die or end suffering through suicide.
    - The writer does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them; rather, they are grappling with the decision to act on a known plan.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post explicitly states, ""I have a plan,"" and further details: ""I know where I'll attempt, I know how, I know what I need, I know how and when I can run away from home."" This clearly indicates a specific plan, knowledge of a method (""how""), location (""where""), and means (""what I need""), as well as a temporal aspect (""when I can run away from home,"" ""It must be a Tuesday""). This meets the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current thoughts and a future intention with a plan.
    - It does not describe a past or very recent *initiated action*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which would qualify for 'Ideation'.
    - However, it goes beyond mere ideation by explicitly stating, ""I have a plan,"" and detailing that the author knows the ""where,"" ""how,"" and ""what I need"" for an attempt, and a specific timeline (""Tuesday""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die *AND* mention of a plan, method, or preparations.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    - The content is far too specific and direct in its suicidal intent and planning to be classified as 'Indicator'.

Based on the explicit mention of a plan, method, and location, the classification is 'Behavior'.

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse.

    - Emotional indicators: ""angry,"" ""upset,"" ""completely done with the world,"" ""crying in the garage at 3am,"" ""guilty,"" ""beyond pissed,"" ""down,"" ""migraine"" making feelings worse. ""Can't see a solution or a way out"" indicates hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are described.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The desire to die/not exist is current (""right now,"" ""I'm done"").
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, repeated, and personal desire to die or not exist. It is not presented as unwanted thoughts, but as a genuine wish for cessation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, multiple times: ""want to die,"" ""I want it to be over,"" ""I don't want to be here,"" ""want to not exist,"" ""I'm done,"" ""I want to be done,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I do not want to exist anymore.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly expressed as a personal wish. The phrase ""fight the urge to go wandering off into the night"" is about fighting an urge for reckless behavior stemming from indifference, not fighting the *desire* to die or not exist.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""Wandering off into the night"" is vague and does not constitute a specific lethal method or plan.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current feelings and intentions.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear and repeated personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""want to die,"" ""want to not exist,"" ""I'm done,"" etc.). This rules out 'Indicator' because there is explicit personal intent.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out suicide. The phrase ""wandering off into the night"" is an expression of indifference or recklessness, not a concrete plan or method for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and desire to die/not exist without a specific plan or method.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""ideations of suicide"", ""battling to stay alive"", ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive"", ""Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it"", ""I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.""
    - Emotional indicators: High levels of distress, hopelessness, shame, isolation, anhedonia (loss of appetite, difficulty leaving bed, not going to gym), feeling like a burden.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post explicitly states ""ideations"" but no concrete plan or method.
    - References to past actions: Mentions past depression, past decisions/mistakes, losing friends, but no past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: The language ""Everyday I feel like..."", ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive,"" ""battling to stay alive"" indicates an ongoing, persistent state of suicidal ideation and desire to not be alive, rather than an immediate plan.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, repeated desire to not be alive and comfort found in suicidal thoughts (""The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide"", ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive"", ""people/the world would be better off without me"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""ideations of suicide"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive,"" ""Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it,"" ""people/the world would be better off without me.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer finds ""comfort"" in these ideations, even while ""battling to stay alive."" The fear of police intervention is about the consequence of *revealing* the ideations, not about the ideations being unwanted.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

I just want connection. I can't take this anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""thinking about killing myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""so lonely,"" ""painful,"" ""can't take this anymore,"" ""What the fuck is wrong with me?"" - indicates severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""I can't take this anymore"" suggests a current crisis point, but no specific timeline for action.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is clearly experiencing suicidal thoughts (""thinking about killing myself""). While they state ""If I had just one friend I wouldn't be thinking about killing myself,"" this indicates the *cause* of the thoughts, not a negation of their presence or a statement that they don't want to act on them. The overall tone, especially ""I can't take this anymore,"" suggests a genuine desire for the pain to end, which is consistent with suicidal ideation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""thinking about killing myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the combination of ""thinking about killing myself"" and ""I can't take this anymore"" strongly indicates a desire for the current suffering to end, which is a form of suicidal intent.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. While they link the thoughts to loneliness, they do not explicitly state they don't want to die or don't want to act on the thoughts. The phrase ""I can't take this anymore"" suggests the opposite.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current thoughts and feelings (""I'm thinking,"" ""I can't take this anymore"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts (""thinking about killing myself"") and a desire for the current situation to end (""I can't take this anymore""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post describes a desire for ""constant anxiety and sadness... to stop by crashing into another car"" and expresses fear of ""won't die on impact."" This clearly indicates a desire for death via a specific method (car crash).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""constant anxiety and sadness,"" ""pointless situation.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""crashing into another car"" is a specific method.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""frequently come close to doing it but never can because I'm afraid that I won't die on impact."" This describes an ongoing impulse and near-actions, but explicitly states the action is *not* completed or initiated due to fear of failure.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""frequently come close to doing it"" suggests ongoing, current impulses.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for suffering to end by dying, specifically through a car crash. The fear is of *not* dying, which reinforces the desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the desire for the ""situation to stop by crashing into another car"" and the fear of ""won't die on impact"" clearly indicate a desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to act, with the only hesitation being fear of the attempt failing.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""crashing into another car"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations like notes or acquiring items, but the repeated ""frequently come close to doing it"" suggests a recurring engagement with the method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and an ongoing, frequently considered future intention (""frequently come close to doing it"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The phrase ""never can"" explicitly states that the action has *not* been initiated. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I want... to stop by crashing into another car""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly mentions a specific method (""crashing into another car""). This presence of a specific method or plan moves it beyond 'Ideation' and into 'Behavior'.
    *   The post explicitly states the action is ""never can"" be carried out, meaning a concrete, potentially lethal action has not been initiated. This rules out 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions a specific method.

    - Imminence: ""Only a matter of when."" This indicates a current, ongoing intent, not a past thought or a fleeting idea.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die, explicitly stated as ""I'm going to kill myself.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes.

    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:

    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, explicit, personal expression of suicidal intent and a desire to die (""I'm going to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly uses ""Death is an option,"" ""die,"" and ""suicidal thought.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The phrase ""It's not the worst outcome"" regarding accidental death suggests a significant lack of desire to live or an indifference to life, bordering on a passive death wish.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. The user explicitly states, ""I won't commit.""
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** Not applicable as no active intention is stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer states ""I won't commit,"" which negates active self-harm. However, they also state that death, particularly accidental death without suffering, is ""not the worst outcome."" This indicates an acceptance of death, or a passive desire not to be alive, rather than a strong desire to live. They are also questioning if *their own thoughts* about death being an option are suicidal, implying they are experiencing such thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, it uses ""suicidal thought"" in reference to their own thinking.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? While not an active ""I want to die,"" the statement ""Death is an option"" and ""It's not the worst outcome"" for accidental death indicates a passive death wish or a profound indifference to being alive. This aligns with ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states ""I won't commit,"" which negates acting on a plan. However, they are not stating that they *don't want* the thoughts themselves. Instead, they are contemplating and questioning the nature of these thoughts. The acceptance of death as ""not the worst outcome"" is a key indicator of a passive desire for death.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned.
    *   No signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current thought process (""Death is an option. Does thinking..."").
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action was initiated in the past or recently.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') because the author explicitly mentions ""suicidal thought"" in relation to their own thinking and expresses a passive acceptance/desire for death (""Death is an option,"" ""It's not the worst outcome""). This is a personal expression of thoughts about death as an acceptable outcome for themselves.
    *   It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past or very recent initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The explicit personal contemplation of death as an option and an acceptable outcome, even if passive and without a plan, fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill me"", ""finally kill me"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""I wish i didnt have to do this"" (indicates distress, but the overall tone is determined intent).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Tonight is the last chance"", ""Its been a year since i planned this"", ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"". This strongly indicates a plan and preparations.
    - References to past actions: ""Its been a year since i planned this"" refers to past *planning*, not a past initiated attempt.
    - Imminence: ""Tonight is the last chance"". Very imminent.
    - Stated desire: Clear desire to ""finally kill me"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill me"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""finally kill me"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, despite a fleeting ""wish I didn't have to do this"", the post concludes with ""im doing the right after all"" and expresses determination to proceed.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Not explicitly, but ""have the stuff prepared and everything"" strongly implies concrete preparation for a method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""have the stuff prepared and everything"".
    - This clearly leans towards 'Behavior' due to the explicit mention of planning and preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past planning phase (""Its been a year since i planned this"") and a very imminent current/future intention (""Tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. It describes planning and current preparation, but no *initiated action* that was stopped or failed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit suicidal intent and desire to die.
    - Not 'Ideation' because there is more than just thoughts/desire; there is explicit mention of planning (""planned this"") and preparation (""have the stuff prepared and everything"").
    - Not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent *initiated action* (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself"") is described. The ""planned this"" refers to the conceptualization phase, not an action.
    - This fits 'Behavior' because it contains explicit suicidal intent, a clear timeframe for action, and specific mentions of planning and having preparations (""stuff prepared"").

    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, self-loathing (""I hate my body""), despair, desire for an end.
    - Specific plans, methods: ""decided to stop eating all together and stave myself"". This is a stated method to achieve death.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I've decided to stop eating all together"" indicates a current decision to initiate a method.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"" clearly expresses a desire to die. The preceding phrase ""I'm to much of a pussy to kill myself"" refers to a *specific method* (e.g., immediate, active self-harm), but is immediately followed by the articulation of an *alternative method* to achieve the same end (death), confirming the underlying desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to act on the thoughts, albeit through a specific, chosen method.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""stop eating all together and stave myself"" is a clear, specific method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? ""I've decided to stop eating all together"" indicates the initiation of this method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current decision and intention (""I've decided to stop eating"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes a *decision to initiate* a plan, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It also explicitly mentions a specific plan/method to achieve this: ""decided to stop eating all together and stave myself."" This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    - It does not describe a past initiated action that was potentially lethal and then stopped or failed. It describes a current decision to implement a plan. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of a clear desire to die *and* a specific method/plan places it firmly in the 'Behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or specific methods. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is present, which is a negation, implying that sometimes they *do* wish to be gone, but it's not a direct statement of intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""not ok,"" ""cold, broken heart,"" ""dragged my face through the muds of life,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness."" These indicate significant general distress, past trauma, and current emotional pain.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: Describes past difficult life experiences (""stripped away from my character,"" ""dragged my face through the muds of life""), but not past suicidal actions or attempts.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No intentions are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer states ""I don't always wish to be gone,"" which suggests that sometimes they might, but it's not a clear, current, explicit desire to die. The overall tone is one of profound distress and loneliness, but also resilience (""somehow I'm still standing"") and a plea for connection (""I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No clear, explicit, current desire. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is ambiguous and a negation, not an affirmation of a desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" acts similarly, indicating that the desire to be ""gone"" is not constant or necessarily a current, active intent. The primary sentiment is distress and loneliness.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past traumatic experiences and current feelings of profound distress, confusion, and loneliness. No current or future suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and loneliness (""not ok,"" ""cold, broken heart,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness"").
    - It lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or explicit suicidal intent from the author. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is ambiguous and does not constitute a clear, present suicidal desire.
    - There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations.
    - There are no descriptions of past initiated suicidal actions.
    - Given the ambiguity around the desire to be ""gone"" and the strong emphasis on general distress and seeking connection, the 'Indicator' category, which covers general distress and lacks clear, current, personal suicidal intent, is the most appropriate fit. The rule ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator"" also applies here.

The only person I have is my sibling, but I only feel worse knowing I'm hurting to delay the pain my death will cause. When I look at myself, I just feel pathetic and wish I wasn't so broken. I want a restart :/",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal"", ""my death"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""permanently fucked up this life"", ""destroyed myself"", ""depressed constantly"", ""lonely"", ""barely even have the strength to go to school"", ""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?"", ""hurting to delay the pain my death will cause"", ""pathetic"", ""broken"". These show severe hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being a burden.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to a suicidal act.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated, but the phrase ""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?"" and ""delay the pain my death will cause"" suggests a current desire to end suffering, even if not immediate.
    - Assessed desire: The writer explicitly states ""I'm depressed constantly, suicidal, and lonely."" This is a direct statement of having suicidal feelings. The desire for a ""restart"" or to not ""push on"" in the context of being suicidal indicates a desire to end their current existence.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?"", ""delay the pain my death will cause"" (implying death is desired or expected), and the general context of being ""suicidal"" and wanting a ""restart"" from a ""fucked up"" life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement ""I'm depressed constantly, suicidal, and lonely"" is a direct affirmation of these feelings without negation.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a future outlook/desire (""Why push on..."", ""my death will cause"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""suicidal"" and expresses a clear desire to not continue living in its current state (""Why push on..."", ""wish I could restart""). This goes beyond general distress and indicates a personal desire to die or end existence, thus ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, without a plan, method, or preparation.

Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""take my own life,"" ""end myself,"" ""best I head out."" These are direct and clear expressions of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Nothing is happening in my life,"" ""stagnant""), despair, feeling trapped (""can't quit,"" ""can't stop working""), physical pain (""destroyed my body"").

    - References to past actions: No past suicidal *actions* are mentioned, only past *thoughts* (""Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself"").
    - Imminence: ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life"" suggests uncertainty about timing, not immediate imminence. ""Suicide becoming more enticing"" suggests a growing inclination.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die/end life. The thoughts are presented as a potential solution, not as unwanted intrusions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""take my own life,"" and ""end myself.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive (""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""best to end myself,"" ""best I head out"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - The phrase ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life"" confirms the absence of a concrete plan.

    - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, and a future, uncertain intention (""I don't know if or when I will take my own life"").
    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. It describes *thinking* about such actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I just slit my wrists,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" ""I just want to get it over with,"" ""if you are seeing this then its already too late,"" ""radial artery,"" ""dremel and put the saw attachment on,"" ""followed the lines,"" ""wont have much time to live,"" ""Goodbye.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""so distant to everyone,"" ""not a good person,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" ""despair,"" ""want to get it over with.""
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: The post explicitly describes a method (""slit my wrists""), a tool (""dremel and put the saw attachment on""), and anatomical targeting (""radial artery,"" ""marked where the my artery should be,"" ""looked at many different pictures and graphs""). It also describes preparation (""typed this out before and will post it once i have done it"").
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: ""I just slit my wrists."" This is a clear statement of an action that has already been initiated. ""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it"" further confirms the action preceded the posting.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""wont have much time to live,"" ""if you are seeing this then its already too late."" High imminence.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die and end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but it clearly expresses a desire for death (""my death will only benefit people,"" ""I just want to get it over with"") and describes a lethal act with intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, absolutely.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer has clearly acted on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""slit my wrists"" with a ""dremel and put the saw attachment on"" targeting the ""radial artery."" This is extremely specific.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""looked at many different pictures and graphs of where the radial artery is,"" ""marked where the my artery should be,"" and typing the post *before* the act to post *after* the act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past, initiated action: ""I just slit my wrists."" The statement ""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it"" confirms the action occurred *before* the post was made.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""I just slit my wrists"" using a specific tool and targeting a specific artery. This is a concrete, potentially lethal action that was initiated.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly states a past, initiated, potentially lethal action: ""I just slit my wrists."" The detailed description of the method and the statement about posting after the act confirm that a concrete suicidal act has already taken place. This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - It is not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit suicidal intent and action.
    - It is not 'Ideation' because there is a specific initiated action, not just thoughts or desire.
    - It is not 'Behavior' because 'Behavior' implies a plan for a *future* act, whereas this post describes an act that has *already been initiated*.

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself. Is it better to be honest or is keeping quiet, potentially for his own health, better?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The author explicitly states, ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself.""

    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current personal struggle and desire (""I'm suicidal myself,"" ""I don't want to keep going myself"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. It describes thoughts and feelings, not an initiated action.

    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past or very recent initiated suicidal action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""kill myself"" is explicitly stated.
    - Emotional indicators: Blame, anger, and a sense of being wronged (""It's other people's fault,"" ""It's everyone else's fault""). There's an implication of distress (""If I become worse"").
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The intention is conditional (""If I become worse...""). It's a future possibility, not immediate intent, but it is a direct statement of potential suicide.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer states ""kill myself"" as a potential action, attributing the cause to others. There is no negation of this desire; rather, it's presented as a potential outcome.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? It expresses the *potential* for the author to kill themselves, framed as a consequence of others' actions. This is a direct, personal expression of suicidal ideation, even if conditional.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer does not negate the thought or potential action.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a conditional future intention (""If I become worse and... kill myself"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""kill myself"" by the author. This moves it beyond 'Indicator' because it's a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent, even if conditional.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the explicit, personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") without a plan or past action fits the definition of 'Ideation'. The conditional nature of the statement does not negate the presence of the suicidal thought itself.

    - Imminence: Not present for any suicidal intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: This is critical. The post states ""I wanted to die when i made that post"" (referring to a past feeling while drafting a message), but then explicitly states ""i just don't want to die"".

    - There is no current desire to die, no plan, no method, and no past initiated suicidal action described.
    - The primary message is one of struggling with overwhelming feelings and a desperate need for support, despite the presence of unwanted suicidal thoughts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself,"" ""fear of death,"" ""scared to die,"" ""hope that I don't wake up.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I hate it,"" ""scared,"" ""cry myself to sleep,"" ""neverending cycle,"" ""I'm done."" These clearly indicate despair, hopelessness, and a strong desire for the current state to end.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions parents taking ""any means they can think of,"" implying a history of concern or past actions (by parents) to prevent, but the author does not state a current specific plan, method, or preparation *they* are undertaking. ""I could do it right now"" expresses perceived capability and imminence, but not a method.
    - References to past actions: The mention of parents taking means refers to past preventative actions by others, not a past initiated suicidal act by the author.
    - Imminence: ""I could do it right now"" suggests a current, immediate potential, even if fear is a barrier.
    - Asses the writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to die (""The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it,"" ""hope that I don't wake up,"" ""I'm done""). The fear is of the act of dying and what comes after, not a negation of the desire to die itself.

    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it,"" and ""hope that I don't wake up,"" and ""I'm done.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to die is present, even with fear as a barrier. The fear is of death, not of the suicidal thoughts themselves.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The post mentions parents removing ""means,"" but the author does not state *their* current specific method or tool. ""I could do it right now"" is a statement of capability, not a description of a method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current/future intention (""I could do it right now,"" ""I'm done""). The mention of parents taking means is contextual background, not a description of a past initiated action by the author.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The post describes intense suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but not a concrete, initiated suicidal act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""killing myself,"" ""I'm done,"" ""hope that I don't wake up""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation by the author for carrying out suicide. The phrase ""I could do it right now"" indicates imminence and capability but lacks a specific *how*. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated* suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the the post fits the 'Ideation' category as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, without a specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

It was extraordinarily painful, but what was hurting me is about to end. The light at the end of the tunnel is almost here. I came extraordinarily close to killing myself. As in, my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""came extraordinarily close to killing myself.""
    *   Emotional indicators: The post describes past ""desperate"" and ""extraordinarily painful"" feelings, but the current sentiment is positive (""made the decision to live,"" ""no longer as desperate,"" ""light at the end of the tunnel"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""my letters were written,"" ""I had a set plan,"" ""days away from going through with."" These are described as *past* preparations and a plan.
    *   References to past actions: The author explicitly states, ""I came extraordinarily close to killing myself. As in, my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with."" This refers to a past period of high risk.
    *   Imminence: The past plan was ""days away from going through with."" The current state is one of choosing to live.
    *   Writer's stated desire: Currently, the writer states they ""made the decision to live."" The past desire was to die, leading to the described preparations.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" in the context of a past, very near-suicidal act.
    *   The post describes a past clear desire to die, evidenced by the preparations and plan. The *current* desire is to live.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions preparations: ""my letters were written"" and ""I had a set plan."" These are concrete signs of preparation for a suicidal act. These are described as *past* preparations.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a *past* period of suicidal intent and preparation (""came extraordinarily close,"" ""letters were written,"" ""set plan,"" ""days away from going through with""). The current context is one of having overcome that period.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The post states the author was ""days away from going through with"" the plan, meaning the lethal action itself was *not initiated*. ""My letters were written"" is a preparation, not an initiated lethal action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' (which requires a concrete, potentially lethal action to have been *initiated*).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly details a *past* period where the author had explicit suicidal intent, a set plan, and concrete preparations (""letters were written"").
    *   This description of a plan and preparations, even if past, fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" The post explicitly describes past preparations and a plan.
    *   It does not fit 'Attempt' because no potentially lethal action was *initiated*; the author was only ""days away from going through with"" it.
    *   It is more severe than 'Ideation' because concrete preparations (writing letters) and a plan were involved.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because the past intent was explicit and involved concrete steps.
    *   Even though the current sentiment is positive, the post *contains* a clear description of past suicidal behavior.

And I'm angry that it would be considered selfish by so many",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""not doing it years ago"" (implying suicide), ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" ""wish that I had just done it,"" ""wouldn't be here now.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""angry at myself,"" ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" ""angry that it would be considered selfish."" Shows despair, regret, and a desire for an end to suffering.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: The post refers to past *thoughts* and *desires* (""first time I thought about it,"" ""not doing it years ago,"" ""wished I wasn't alive... since 2012""), not actual initiated attempts. The phrasing ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it"" explicitly states that the action was *not* taken.
    - Imminence: No immediate intention stated. The focus is on past regret and ongoing desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to not be alive and regret for not having acted on past suicidal thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No direct mention, but phrases like ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it"" strongly imply suicide in context.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I've wished I wasn't alive and wanted things to be over fairly regularly since about 2012.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses regret for *not* acting on them in the past.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past and ongoing feelings/desires (""since 2012"") and current regret about past *inaction* (""angry at myself for not doing it years ago,"" ""wish that I had just done it"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The post explicitly states ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it,"" which means the action was *not* taken. It's a regret about *not* having attempted, not a description of an attempt itself.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to not be alive and regret for not having died in the past. This is more than general distress; it's explicit suicidal thought/desire. So, not 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. So, not 'Behavior'.
    - The post describes *not* having acted on past thoughts, and wishing they *had* acted. It does *not* describe a past initiated, potentially lethal action. The key phrases ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it"" confirm the absence of an actual attempt. So, not 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""killing myself,"" ""dead.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depressed,"" ""It sucks so much.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user states, ""I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a clear preparation (a suicide note/will).
    *   **References to past actions:** The note is described as something already written (""I have past the point where i have written a note""). This is a completed preparation, not an initiated lethal action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""there are times where i just get ready to die"" suggests current intent, though interrupted by other thoughts.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""still wanting to die,"" ""I'm depressed and suicidal."" There is a clear, genuine wish to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" ""still wanting to die,"" and ""killing myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    *   No, the writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions; rather, they state they *do* want to die despite the administrative hurdles.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned.
    *   Yes, there is a clear sign of preparation: ""I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a definitive preparation.
    *   Since there is a desire to die and a clear preparation, this points towards 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state of suicidal desire (""still wanting to die,"" ""get ready to die"") and a completed preparation (""have written a note"").
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. Writing a note is a preparation, not an initiated attempt. The post describes *getting ready to die* but being stopped by a thought, not an actual physical attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""suicidal,"" ""still wanting to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post mentions a specific preparation: ""I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a concrete step taken towards a suicidal act, which goes beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    *   The post does not describe a past or very recent *initiated* potentially lethal action. Writing a note is preparation, not an 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific preparation (the note) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

311,"I want to help my suicidal online friend who has been through literal hell but I don't know how and I'm scared. I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks. Sorry for the post that is all over the place I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above. Thanks, have a good day.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end my own life,"" ""suicide,"" ""killing myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""anger issues,"" ""caused hurt,"" ""emotional pain,"" ""numbers dwindle,"" ""cry for help.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post is highly analytical and philosophical.
    - References to past actions: ""never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own"" refers to anger, not a past suicide attempt.
    - Imminence: The writer is currently ""checking I'm making the right decision"" and ""haven't been able to convince myself"" against it, indicating a current and active consideration of suicide.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states, ""I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic."" While a ""cry for help"" is acknowledged, the dominant sentiment is a reasoned conclusion that suicide is the correct path, and they are seeking a counter-argument they haven't found. This is a clear personal desire to die.

    - Specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied: No.
    - Signs of preparation: No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Describes a past event, current/future intention, or both: Primarily a current logical conclusion and a future intention (""to end my own life,"" ""making the right decision"").
    - Describes a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently: No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, explicit, personal desire to die (""I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life""). It's not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.

I won't ever be happy in this world and how it is now. Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure. I'm from the UK, so i can't get hold of a gun which would solve everything. Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""end it all,"" ""solve everything"" (in context of ending life), ""don't want to be here.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""tired,"" ""thoughts always just come back to this,"" ""won't ever be happy,"" ""everything is a chore,"" ""everyday is pressure."" This indicates hopelessness and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions a ""gun which would solve everything"" and expresses frustration about not being able to get one due to being from the UK. It also asks, ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"" This indicates a desire for a specific method and a search for options.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated, but the current distress is clear.
    - Stated desire: There is a clear desire to die/end life (""I don't want it anymore,"" ""end it all,"" ""don't want to be here"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No direct phrase, but ""end it all"" and ""don't want to be here,"" in context, clearly convey suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""I won't ever be happy in this world,"" ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is expressing a desire to act on them, or at least find a way to.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, a ""gun"" is mentioned as a desired method (""would solve everything""). The subsequent question ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"" implies an active search or desire for a viable method. While not a concrete, actionable plan in progress, the explicit mention of a specific method (even if unobtainable) and the expressed desire for ""a good option"" to ""end it all"" moves it beyond mere ideation.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current distress and a future intention/desire to end life.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's a clear, personal desire to die/end life.
    - It's not 'Attempt' as no past initiated action is described.
    - It's between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which is 'Ideation'. However, it goes further by mentioning a specific method (""gun"") as something that ""would solve everything"" and then explicitly asks for ""a good option for us to end it all."" This indicates a consideration of *how* to carry out the suicidal intent, even if the preferred method is unavailable and no concrete plan is detailed. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" The mention of a ""gun"" as a desired method and the search for ""a good option"" for ""us to end it all"" constitutes mentioning a specific method or a desire for one, which aligns with 'Behavior'.

Final decision: The explicit desire to die, coupled with the mention of a specific method (gun) and the search for ""a good option"" to ""end it all,"" fits the criteria for 'Behavior' as it indicates thinking about means to carry out the intent.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not. I believe in God but sometimes he feels so far away. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to post. I have no one to talk to.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post states ""I wish I could die"" twice and ""I wish I could curl up and die."" No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning,"" ""I feel like a failure""), despair (""I wish I could die""), anxiety, depression, feeling alone (""I have no one to talk to"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicidal acts.
    - Imminence of intentions: The wishes are general expressions of distress, not immediate plans.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die,"" indicating a desire for non-existence. While there is ambivalence (""I would worry about them if I died,"" ""I love them. I would die for them.""), the direct wish to die is present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die"" express a clear desire to die/not be alive.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses the wish directly, not as an unwanted thought. The ambivalence is a reason *not* to act, but doesn't negate the stated desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""I wish I could die,"" ""I wish I could curl up and die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator', which lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her.

    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The act of masturbating is described as a coping mechanism tied to the thoughts, not a plan for suicide.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: No, it describes internal thoughts and feelings, and a disturbing coping mechanism, but not an initiated suicidal act.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""kept thinking about wanting to kill myself"" indicates ongoing, persistent thoughts and desire.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes ongoing thoughts and feelings (""kept thinking about wanting to kill myself"") and a coping mechanism.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed?

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support.

I've had issues with self harm in the past and I've gotten to the point where nobody really believes that im in pain. A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly mentions ""cutting"" multiple times (""your not cutting your faking it!"", ""I've had issues with self harm in the past"", ""she saw my arm"", ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"", ""Btw theres about a dozen scars""). It describes a specific past instance: ""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out."" This is a clear description of a self-harm incident. The post also mentions ""encouraging K to kill herself,"" but this is directed at the girlfriend, not the author.
    - Emotional indicators: ""tired,"" ""in pain,"" ""numb and empty inside,"" ""cried myself to sleep,"" ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and questioning of life's value.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No current plans, methods, or preparations for *suicide* are mentioned. The past action described is self-harm (cutting).
    - References to past actions: Yes, a very specific past self-harm incident is described (""A few months ago... used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out""). General past self-harm is also mentioned (""I've had issues with self harm in the past"").
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" indicates current despair but no immediate suicidal intent.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses deep distress and questions the worth of life, but does not explicitly state a current desire to die or commit suicide. The past self-harm was stated as being ""to relieve some of the pain.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not for the author.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" indicates significant despair and a questioning of the value of life, which is a strong indicator of suicidal ideation. However, it's not a direct ""I want to die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, not for a *suicidal* act. The past action was ""cutting,"" which is a method of self-harm.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. It describes a specific past self-harm incident (""A few months ago... used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out"") and current despair (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes. The description of cutting ""a few months ago"" where the girlfriend ""freaked out"" upon seeing the arm, clearly indicates a specific, self-initiated action. While the stated intent was ""to relieve some of the pain"" (often associated with non-suicidal self-injury), cutting can be a potentially lethal action depending on its severity. The definition of 'Attempt' covers ""specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" This fits the description of the past cutting incident.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains elements of 'Ideation' (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"") due to the expression of despair and questioning the worth of life.
    - However, the most definitive element, according to the provided definitions, is the clear description of a past, specific, self-initiated action of self-harm (cutting) that was discovered. While the stated intent was pain relief, the act of cutting is a physical action that can be ""potentially lethal."" The 'Attempt' definition focuses on the *initiation of a potentially lethal action*, not solely on explicit suicidal intent at the time of the act.
    - The rule states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The past cutting incident is clearly described as an initiated action.

Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification because of the detailed description of a past, specific, initiated self-harm action that could be considered potentially lethal.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""depressive spell,"" ""spiraling worse,"" ""worry,"" ""nightmare,"" ""long wait in depression time scales."" Also mentions bipolar 1, visual hallucinations, and delusions.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The user is actively trying to *avoid* acting on thoughts.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal *actions* (attempts) are mentioned. Only a history of symptoms.
    - Imminence of intentions: No imminent intention to act. The user is struggling with the thoughts and seeking solutions (going to hospital, coping methods).
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states, ""I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point"" and ""I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change."" This indicates a desire *not* to act on the thoughts, but rather to manage them or seek help.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal ideation,"" ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a desire to *avoid* acting on these thoughts and to seek help.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I'd rather... go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts."" This is a key phrase.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current struggles with suicidal ideation and future considerations for seeking help (going to the hospital).
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts,"" so it's more than just general distress. This might initially point to 'Ideation'.
    - However, the crucial part is the writer's stated desire: ""I'd rather... go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point."" And ""I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change."" This explicitly states that the thoughts are present, but the writer *does not want to act on them* and is actively seeking alternatives/help.
    - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" This aligns perfectly with the user's statement. The primary sentiment is distress *about* having suicidal thoughts and the barriers to getting help, not a personal desire to die.
    - There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no past initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, despite the presence of ""suicidal ideation,"" the explicit negation of desire to act and the focus on seeking help places it in 'Indicator'.

My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, anger (""Fuck that,"" ""Fuck them!,"" ""They will pay for how they made me feel!"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily."" This is a specific, self-initiated, ongoing behavior that is inherently dangerous and potentially lethal. It is mentioned in conjunction with a clear desire to die. While not explicitly stated as *the* suicide method, it serves as a concrete, high-risk action that aligns with the stated intent to die. No explicit notes or giving things away.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I once took an anti psychotic..."" (This refers to medication side effects, not a past suicide attempt).
    *   **Imminence:** ""Soon I will be finally dead.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die: ""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead."" This is explicit personal intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The user mentions ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily."" This is a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action involving a substance. While not a *plan* for a discrete future act like ""I will overdose tonight,"" it is a *current, ongoing, specific action* that is highly dangerous and serves as a means of self-harm or achieving death, especially when coupled with the explicit desire to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current, ongoing action (""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily"") and a future intention (""Soon I will be finally dead"").
    *   The crucial element is ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily."" This is a ""specific, self-initiated action by the author that was potentially lethal."" Even though it's ongoing rather than a single, failed event, it fits the criteria of an *initiated, potentially lethal action*. The ""very recent"" part of the 'Attempt' definition can encompass an action that has very recently begun and is continuing. It is more than just a plan (Behavior) because it is actively being carried out.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to clear desire to die and specific actions.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is a specific, ongoing, potentially lethal action (daily heroin use) beyond just thoughts or desires.
    *   **Behavior:** This category typically refers to a *plan* for a future act (e.g., ""thinking of overdosing,"" ""want to jump""). While the heroin use could be seen as a ""method,"" the phrasing ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily"" describes a *current, initiated, ongoing action*, not just a future plan or preparation.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The daily heroin use is a ""specific, self-initiated action"" that is ""potentially lethal."" The phrase ""have started to do"" implies a very recent initiation of this ongoing action. This ongoing, active, and potentially lethal behavior, explicitly linked to a desire to die, aligns most closely with the 'Attempt' category, as it describes a concrete, initiated action rather than just a plan or ideation. It's a continuous, self-harming act that is actively being performed and is highly dangerous.

    The key here is that the user is *currently engaging* in a specific, potentially lethal behavior (daily heroin use) and explicitly links it to their desire to die. This is an initiated action, not just a thought or a future plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods: Yes, ""gun,"" ""hitting the brain stem."" This is a specific lethal method.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you... I genuinely do not care for any of those things."" This indicates a strong sense of despair, anhedonia, and a clear rejection of reasons to live, suggesting a genuine desire to die.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: Yes, the question ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem"" is a direct inquiry about the execution of a specific lethal method. This implies planning or researching a method.
    - References to past actions: No.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated, but the query about method details suggests current consideration.
    - Writer's stated desire: The dismissal of reasons to live strongly indicates a personal desire to die, not just unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, by asking about a specific lethal method and explicitly stating indifference to reasons for living, a clear personal desire to die is strongly implied.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite. The post implies a desire to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""gun"" and ""hitting the brain stem"" are specific method and target.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Asking for optimal positioning for a lethal method is a form of planning/research, indicating a step towards preparation.
    - If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. If there is *any* mention of a method or preparation, it leans towards 'Behavior'. Here, there is a clear method (gun) and a specific detail about its application.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention, seeking information for a potential future act.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it is not describing a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is incorrect because there is a clear personal desire to die (implied) and a specific method being discussed.
    - 'Ideation' is incorrect because the post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire; it discusses a specific method (""gun"") and seeks details on its execution (""position... for hitting the brain stem""). This constitutes a plan/method.
    - 'Behavior' is the best fit. The post expresses a clear desire to die (by dismissing reasons to live) and explicitly mentions a specific method (gun) while seeking information about how to carry out that method effectively. This falls under mentioning a plan or method.
    - 'Attempt' is incorrect because the post is asking for information on *how* to do something, not describing an action that has already been initiated or completed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thought about killing myself"", ""self harm scars"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""everything just keeps getting worse"", ""upset"", ""dramatic"". The ""lol"" seems to be a dismissive or sarcastic reaction to the mother, not an indicator of positive emotion.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""self harm scars"" indicates past self-harm, but not a past suicide *attempt* (an initiated, potentially lethal action). ""haven't thought about killing myself"" refers to persistent thoughts, not an initiated action.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated, but the persistence (""single day,"" ""won't leave my head"") suggests ongoing distress.
    - Writer's stated desire: The constant thoughts of ""killing myself"" in a context of worsening despair strongly imply a personal struggle with suicidal ideation. The phrase ""it won't leave my head"" indicates the intrusive and persistent nature of these thoughts, but doesn't negate the underlying suicidal intent; rather, it highlights the author's current state of being consumed by them.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The persistent and intrusive nature of ""killing myself"" thoughts, combined with the worsening situation, indicates a clear struggle with suicidal intent.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post states ""it won't leave my head,"" which describes the persistence of the thoughts, not a rejection of the desire to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? ""haven't thought about killing myself"" describes a persistent, ongoing state (current/past continuous). ""everything just keeps getting worse"" describes a current worsening situation. ""self harm scars"" refers to past self-harm.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The self-harm scars are not described as a suicide *attempt*, and the thoughts of ""killing myself"" are not described as an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""thought about killing myself"") and a desire to not be alive (implied by the constant thoughts in a context of despair).
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicide attempt. The mention of self-harm scars is not described as a suicide attempt.
    - Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category.

    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; the writer states ""my mind has won"" and ""I am not fighting anymore.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? ""Overdose"" is mentioned as the method for past attempts. For the imminent future attempt, a specific method isn't explicitly detailed, but the intent to ""attempt again"" is clear and imminent. ""Goodbye"" is a strong indicator of preparation.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Goodbye."" and the statement of giving up.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        - Past: ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out,"" ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year."" These are concrete, initiated, potentially lethal actions.
        - Current/Future: ""Just a few more hours... I'm going to attempt again."" This is a clear, imminent future intention.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""I've tried to overdose three times"" and ""my first attempt"" clearly describe initiated, potentially lethal actions by the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains strong current ideation and an imminent plan for a future attempt (""Just a few more hours... I'm going to attempt again""). This would typically point towards 'Behavior'.
    - However, the post also explicitly describes *multiple past, initiated, potentially lethal actions* by the author: ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year.""
    - According to the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" It also states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
    - Given the clear descriptions of past initiated actions, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate and overriding category.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" is a strong indicator of a desire for cessation of suffering, which often implies a desire for death. No explicit mention of suicide or self-harm methods. The mention of his mother's heart stopping and ""hopefully restart until it doesn't"" refers to her death, not his own.
    - Emotional indicators: ""fighting it but I can't anymore,"" ""stuck away,"" ""doing nothing for her everyday,"" ""best friend drowned,"" ""mom doesnt even remember,"" ""father is a pedophile,"" ""family on both sides wants nothing to do with me,"" ""became an alcoholic."" These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, feeling overwhelmed, isolated, and burdened.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""My best friend drowned in front of me and I saved the person that killed him"" is a traumatic past event, not a suicidal action by the author.
    - Imminence: ""I can't anymore"" suggests a current breaking point. ""I just want this pain to end"" is a present desire.
    - Assessed desire: The writer expresses a clear desire for ""this pain to end,"" which in the context of overwhelming despair and feeling unable to continue (""I can't anymore""), strongly implies a desire for death as the ultimate cessation of suffering.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want this pain to end"" in this context strongly conveys a desire for death or non-existence as a release from overwhelming suffering.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is implied by ""I can't anymore"" and the desire for the pain to end.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and intentions (""I can't anymore,"" ""I just want this pain to end"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses overwhelming distress and a desire for ""this pain to end,"" which, given the context of ""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore,"" clearly indicates a personal desire for cessation of life or existence as a means to escape suffering. This goes beyond general distress or abstract thoughts about suicide.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'm suicidal,"" ""time for me to fucking go""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without detailing a plan, method, or preparation.

327,"It's over for me. I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry. I'm so sorry. There is no putting me back together. Im broken. I'm damaged. I'm all fucked up. I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""It's over for me."" ""kill myself,"" ""I should have killed myself a long time ago,"" ""hanging is painless,"" ""I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" ""I promise I wont fail this time."" ""I'm gonna buy the right stuff."" ""Gonna be gone after this weekend.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""It's over for me,"" ""no putting me back together,"" ""broken,"" ""damaged,"" ""all fucked up""), despair (""drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this.""), self-hatred (""fucked up garbage,"" ""monster,"" ""mistake,"" ""trash,"" ""mentally disabled piece of shit,"" ""disgrace"").
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: Mentions ""hanging"" as a method. ""I'm gonna buy the right stuff"" indicates acquiring means/tools. ""Say my goodbyes to the one I love"" indicates preparation. ""Gonna be gone after this weekend"" provides a timeframe.
    - References to past actions: ""I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This is a clear statement of a past, initiated, but failed, suicidal act.
    - Imminence: ""Gonna be gone after this weekend"" indicates a near-future intention.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, strong desire to die and end their life (""It's over for me,"" ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""I promise I won't fail this time"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""It's over for me,"" ""I can't take it anymore"").
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they express a firm intention to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""hanging"") is mentioned.
    - Yes, signs of preparation are mentioned: ""buy the right stuff"" and ""Say my goodbyes.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both a past event and a current/future intention.
    - Crucially, it describes a past, specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated but failed: ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This is a direct statement of a past suicide attempt.
    - The post also describes current planning and future intent (""I promise I won't fail this time. I'm gonna buy the right stuff... Gonna be gone after this weekend."").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes far beyond 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal intent and desire to die.
    - It goes beyond 'Ideation' because it includes a specific method and preparations, which would typically classify it as 'Behavior'.
    - However, the post explicitly describes a *past initiated action* that was potentially lethal: ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This fits the definition of 'Attempt'. The rule states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The past action is clearly described as an initiated attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm planning on killing myself"", ""Adios i can't. It's not worth it."", ""this life for me isn't it.""
    - Emotional indicators: Expresses current distress (""I don't know what's wrong with me"") and projects potential future despair (""if i still feel the same or worse"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) or preparation (e.g., note writing, acquiring means) is mentioned. The ""plan"" is solely temporal (""at 30 or 25"").
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: Not imminent. The intention is explicitly set for ""at 30 or 25"", with ""a long time to rethink"" and ""over the course of the passing years.""
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die under certain future conditions. It is not presented as unwanted thoughts, but as a potential course of action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Adios i can't. It's not worth it. I'm sorry to the people i know in advance."", ""this life for me isn't it."" This desire is conditional on future feelings but is clearly stated.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, they state a plan for potential future action, even if it's far off and conditional.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No. The ""planning"" is about *when*, not *how*, and involves no concrete steps.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A future intention, conditional on how the writer feels at a specific age.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'm planning on killing myself"", ""this life for me isn't it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - However, there is no mention of a specific plan (e.g., ""how"" they will do it), method (e.g., pills, gun), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The ""plan"" is only temporal (at a future age), not a specific means of execution. This absence of a concrete method/plan/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but without a specific plan, method, or preparations for carrying it out. The future-dated nature of the intent does not change it from Ideation, as the core element of a desire to die is present.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post mentions ""suicide rate"" but in a general, statistical context, not as a personal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" indicates significant distress, feeling overwhelmed or at a breaking point. ""Perceived as male and a threat"" highlights a source of this distress.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No stated intentions.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses distress and empathy for others' experiences, but does not state a genuine wish to die or suicidal intent for themselves. ""Teetering on the edge"" implies being close to a breaking point, but not explicitly a desire for death.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not in a personal, intentional way. It refers to ""suicide rate"" as a societal observation.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. ""Teetering on the edge"" indicates distress and being at risk, but not a direct statement of wanting to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as personal suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current feeling (""Been teetering on the edge lately"") and an observation about society. No specific action.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" indicates general distress and being at a breaking point, which aligns with the 'Indicator' definition of expressing general distress or hopelessness.
    - The discussion of ""suicide rate"" is abstract and observational, not a personal expression of suicidal intent.
    - There is no explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent stated by the author for themselves.
    - There are no mentions of a plan, method, or preparation.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - Therefore, the post fits the 'Indicator' category as it expresses general distress and discusses suicide abstractly, without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""suicide is a coward way to go out"" (mentioned by mom), ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" (author's direct statement of intent to die).
    - Emotional indicators: Sarcasm (""Thanks mom""), despair/sadness ("":(""), empathy for others (""struggling""). The overall tone is one of resignation and finality.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned. However, ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :("" functions as a farewell message, which is a common form of preparation for suicide.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""within 24 hours"" indicates very high imminence.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The phrase ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" clearly expresses a genuine wish to die and an intent to act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? While ""suicide"" is mentioned by the mom, the author's personal intent is conveyed through ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours,"" which is a clear, direct phrase indicating intent to die by suicide.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" combined with the farewell clearly expresses a desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the author is expressing an intention to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :("" is a clear farewell message, which is a form of preparation (saying goodbye, tying up loose ends emotionally). The high imminence (""within 24 hours"") further supports that this is not just ideation but a planned action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""within 24 hours"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's a statement of future intent, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly goes beyond 'Indicator' because it expresses a direct, personal desire to die and an intent to act, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - It expresses explicit personal suicidal intent, so it's at least 'Ideation'.
    - To determine if it's 'Behavior', we look for a plan, method, or preparations. While a specific method is absent, the farewell message (""Peace out all..."") is a strong indicator of preparation. The very high imminence (""within 24 hours"") also suggests a concrete intention to act, moving beyond mere thoughts. The farewell message serves as a ""preparation being taken"" as per the definition of 'Behavior'. Even without a specific method, the combination of clear intent, imminence, and a farewell (preparation) fits the 'Behavior' category.
    - It is not 'Attempt' as no past initiated action is described.

Conclusion: The post contains explicit suicidal intent, high imminence, and a farewell message which constitutes a preparation. This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.

The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""it's killing me"" is present, but this is an idiom for extreme distress, not a literal statement of suicidal intent. No other direct mentions of suicide, self-harm, or death.
    - Emotional indicators: High levels of distress, feeling trapped (""don't have a choice,"" ""forced into staying silent""), self-hatred (""I hate myself for letting them do that""), hopelessness regarding their situation (""no proof,"" ""can't go to counseling,"" ""parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out"").
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: Past abuse, past attempts to contact authorities, past manipulation. No past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a strong desire to escape their current situation (""I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both"") and intense emotional pain, but *not* a desire to die or end their life. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is clearly metaphorical for the emotional burden.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is an idiom for extreme distress, not a literal desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? N/A, as no suicidal thoughts are mentioned.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. This applies here.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes ongoing abuse and distress.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant emotional distress, a feeling of being trapped, and hopelessness about their current life situation due to abuse.
    - However, there is no explicit personal expression of a desire to die, suicidal thoughts, or intent to harm oneself. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is a common idiom for severe emotional pain.
    - There is no mention of a plan, method, or past attempt.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and hopelessness without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""self harm"" (repeatedly), ""bloodying myself up now"", ""kill myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, frustration, hopelessness (""What the hell makes them think this won't end badly"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned for the act of ""killing myself"". The current self-harm (""bloodying myself up now"") is present, but it is not explicitly stated as the *method* for the ultimate act of killing oneself, rather as a current behavior and a precursor to the stated suicidal intent.
    - References to past actions: ""four months without self harm"", ""I'm self harming again"". These are past and current *self-harm* actions, not past *suicidal attempts*.
    - Imminence: ""It's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time."" This indicates high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""kill myself"", ""I should do it now and save time"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I should do it now and save time"").
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method (e.g., ""overdosing on X pills,"" ""jumping from Y bridge"") or preparation (e.g., ""writing my suicide note,"" ""getting a rope"") for the *suicidal act* is mentioned. While current self-harm is described, it's not explicitly stated as the *method* for the suicidal intent. The phrase ""I should do it now and save time"" expresses urgency but not a concrete plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes past self-harm, current self-harm (""bloodying myself up now""), and a clear future intention to kill oneself (""it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time."").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal *suicidal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently. The ""bloodying myself up now"" is self-harm, not explicitly described as an initiated suicidal attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""kill myself"", ""I should do it now and save time"").
    - Not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal *suicidal action* is described. The self-harm is current but not framed as an attempt to die.
    - The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. However, it *lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations* for carrying out the suicide. The current self-harm is mentioned, but it's not explicitly stated as the method for the suicidal intent. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Since no specific method or preparation for the act of killing oneself is detailed, it falls under 'Ideation'.

I always see people who fucking cheat and mercilessly get bashed for it. i fucking deserve death, im tired if these stupidass ignorant people. please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""someone blow my head off,"" ""im fucking done,"" ""deserve death,"" ""please kill me.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""im fucking done""), self-loathing (""i fucking deserve death""), despair, anger (""tired if these stupidass ignorant people""), fear of harming others (""before i hurt someone"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the author for themselves. The phrases ""someone blow my head off"" and ""please kill me"" are pleas for external action, not an internal plan or method the author intends to use.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""im fucking done,"" ""before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience"" indicates a current, intense state of distress and desire for death.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and strong wish to die or not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not ""kill myself,"" but ""someone blow my head off,"" ""deserve death,"" and ""please kill me"" are very direct expressions of a desire for death.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, unequivocally.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly expressed.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act *by the author themselves*? No. While ""blow my head off"" implies a method (gunshot), it's framed as a request for someone *else* to do it, not a plan the author is making for themselves. There's no mention of the author possessing a gun or having a plan to use one.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there's a strong desire to die but no clear indication of a self-initiated plan/method/preparation, it leans towards 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of despair and a current desire for death.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""im fucking done,"" ""deserve death,"" ""please kill me""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation *by the author* to carry out suicide. The phrases ""someone blow my head off"" and ""please kill me"" are pleas for external action, not internal plans for self-harm. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, but without a specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out by the author.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now,"" which are direct expressions of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""very anxious,"" ""struggle,"" ""can't keep a job,"" ""won't work out long term."" These indicate significant distress and hopelessness about the future.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None are mentioned. There's no indication of how the life would be cut short, or any steps being taken.
    - References to past actions: No past actions related to suicide are mentioned.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""My only option is to cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now"" suggest a current consideration and desire, but not an immediate, concrete plan for *how* or *when* beyond the general ""right now"" as a hypothetical solution.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear and direct wish to die as a solution to their perceived insurmountable problems.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life"" are direct equivalents.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""My only option is to cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now this wouldn't be a problem"" clearly express this desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the thoughts are presented as a potential solution.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire and future intention (""My only option is to cut my life short"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""cut my life short,"" ""ended my life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparations (e.g., ""how"" or ""with what""). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning."" This clearly indicates suicidal intent and a specific method (overdose of pills).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""failure,"" ""can't stand the person looking back at me,"" ""despise myself,"" ""hate myself,"" ""scared,"" ""content in knowing that if I was gone."" These show profound despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The act of ""took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" is a specific method and an action taken.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" are clear references to past, initiated actions.
    *   **Imminence:** The actions described (""yesterday,"" ""last 4 days"") are very recent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning,"" ""content in knowing that if I was gone"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and ""end it all"" (a common euphemism for suicide).
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die, expressed through ""hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning"" and the general sentiment.
    *   No, the writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts; rather, they describe acting on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers."" This is a concrete action involving substances.
    *   The act of *taking* the pills implies preparation (acquiring them).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a current intention (""I want to die"") and, crucially, very recent past actions: ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again.""
    *   Yes, it describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* (taking a large overdose of pills) that was initiated ""yesterday"" with the intent to die, but failed (""here I am""). The phrase ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" further confirms recent initiated actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit ideation (""I want to die"") and mentions of methods/plans (""took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers""). However, the key element here is the description of a *past, initiated, potentially lethal action* that ultimately failed. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'. The phrase ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" further solidifies this, indicating multiple recent attempts.

    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.

    - Imminence of stated intentions: No intentions stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: No stated desire to die. The post is a lament about life's unfairness and personal struggles.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm feeling suicidal"", ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more"", ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""not able to deal with what's going to happen"", ""getting panic attacks"", ""not able to sleep properly"", ""feel like a burden"".
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post talks about suicide as an ""escape"" but does not detail how, when, or with what means.
    - References to past actions: The past action mentioned is being caught with alcohol and weed, which is the trigger for the distress, not a suicidal action.
    - Imminence: The distress is current and increasing, tied to an imminent event (management's decision today). The suicidal thoughts are described as increasing, and suicide as ""the only escape,"" suggesting a current desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear stated desire: ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide."" This is a personal expression of wanting to die as a solution.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" as an ""escape.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive (""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide"").
    - The writer does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts; rather, they are presented as an increasing and seemingly viable option for escape.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned in relation to a suicidal act.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current/future intentions and increasing thoughts in response to an ongoing stressful situation.
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I feel the only escape... is suicide""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific means, location, or preparatory actions like writing a note). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die without a specific plan, method, or preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""end it,"" ""suicide ideation,"" ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink,"" ""my death,"" ""stay on the tracks,"" ""train schedule.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Coward,"" ""up against a wall,"" ""SO MUCH,"" ""twisted and brutal,"" ""too much for anyone to hear,"" ""pain,"" ""heart is too tired and fragile,"" ""accumulated trauma,"" ""no justice,"" ""panic and jump away and start crying."" (Strong indicators of despair, hopelessness, and emotional exhaustion).
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""I know the way I will end it."" ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"" (specific method and location). ""I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks"" (knowledge of details related to the method/location, suggesting familiarity and potential preparation). ""How do I stay on the tracks?"" (implies a desire to overcome the self-interruption).
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: ""the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute."" (Describes past initiated actions where the person reached the point of trying but self-interrupted). ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."" (Explicit mention of a past suicide attempt that led to external intervention).
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The post describes a current struggle with acting on the plan (""I just want to know how not to be a coward and jump away when I see it approaching"").
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: ""I really do not want to do this . But I know this is all I have left."" This shows ambivalence, but the overall context, the detailed planning, and the desire to overcome the ""cowardice"" to ""stay on the tracks"" indicates a strong underlying desire to die despite the internal conflict.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""suicide ideation,"" ""I know the way I will end it,"" ""my death,"" ""wanting to jump.""
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die, despite the stated internal conflict. The question ""How do I stay on the tracks?"" indicates a desire to go through with it.
    - While the writer states ""I really do not want to do this,"" this is immediately followed by ""But I know this is all I have left"" and a plea for help to *overcome* the self-preservation instinct (""How do I stay on the tracks?""). This is not simply distress about unwanted thoughts, but a struggle to act on a desired outcome.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"" is a specific method and location.
    - Yes, ""I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks"" suggests familiarity with the method/location and a level of preparation/reconnaissance.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both past events and current/future intentions.
    - Crucially, it describes *specific, potentially lethal actions* that were initiated in the past:
        - ""the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute"" - This indicates initiated actions (getting to the point of trying to jump) that were self-interrupted.
        - ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."" - This is an explicit and clear description of a past suicide attempt that led to external intervention. This is a concrete, potentially lethal action that was initiated.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly contains ideation and behavior (plan/method). However, the definition of 'Attempt' states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
    - The phrase ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted"" is a clear and unambiguous description of a past initiated suicide attempt. This takes precedence.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""People tell me I'm a burden."" This indicates feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or being a burden.

    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide/self-harm.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No intentions stated.
    - Assessed desire: No stated desire to die or not be alive. The post describes current difficult life circumstances and feelings of being a burden.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current circumstances and feelings.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.
    - Conclusion: No past or recent initiated suicidal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden, along with severe functional impairment.
    - However, it **lacks any clear, current, personal expression of a desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.** There are no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't here,"" or any direct suicidal ideation.
    - Based on the definitions:
        - It does not meet 'Ideation' because there is no explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to not be alive.
        - It does not meet 'Behavior' because there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
        - It does not meet 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past or very recent initiated potentially lethal action.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation. There's nothing there for me and nobody wants me to be there either. I don't even want to be there.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""I don't know how much longer I can last.""
        *   ""I don't know how much longer I can hang on.""
        *   ""most people want me dead.""
        *   ""I don't have much to live for.""
        *   ""I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night."" (Explicit suicide intent with a timeframe)
        *   ""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life tbh"" (Explicit method and desire to die)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""Things aren't getting better,"" ""I don't know what else to do""), despair, feeling unwanted/a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:**
        *   ""kill myself on graduation night"" (Temporal plan/event)
        *   ""stick some knives through my stomach"" (Specific method/tool)
    *   **References to past actions:** None related to suicidal acts. Mentions past bullying and trying to get help at school.
    *   **Imminence:** ""graduation night"" is a specific future event. The desire for the knife method is stated as a current strong wish.
    *   **Stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die and end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I can kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't have much to live for,"" ""be done with life.""
    *   Does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a clear desire to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""stick some knives through my stomach"" is a specific method involving a tool.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night"" indicates a conditional plan with a specific future timeframe. While not active preparation like acquiring means, it's a stated intention with a defined future event.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past experiences leading to current distress and future intentions.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, there is no description of a past *initiated* suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and a desire to die (""I can kill myself,"" ""I don't have much to live for,"" ""be done with life""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""stick some knives through my stomach"") and a conditional plan tied to a future event (""kill myself on graduation night""). This presence of a method and a plan moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past *initiated* suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit mention of a specific method (""knives through my stomach"") and a conditional plan with a timeframe (""kill myself on graduation night""), the most appropriate classification is 'Behavior'.

    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. It describes planning and preparation for a future act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die.
    - It's not 'Ideation' because it explicitly mentions plans, methods (""tall bridges,"" ""a few methods to try""), and preparations (""drafted my suicide notes"").
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent *initiated action* (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to jump"") is described. The actions described are planning and preparation.

Of course there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it, but I need to have the option to end it all. So, with those obstacles out of the way, I'm free to get cracking. I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row, and once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision. Live or die. This is a weight off my chest. It could finally be my time.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""end it all"" (repeatedly), ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't"" (euphemism for suicide), ""end it,"" ""Live or die."" No specific method is named, but ""looking into my options"" implies exploring methods.
    - Emotional indicators: ""free,"" ""blessing,"" ""weight off my chest,"" ""my time."" These indicate a sense of relief and resolution regarding the possibility of suicide.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" ""once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision.""

    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to act on them and is actively preparing.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method is named, but ""looking into my options"" strongly implies the process of identifying a method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""getting my ducks in a row"" and the intention to ""wish you all a farewell"" before acting are clear signs of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current and future intention. ""I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row, and once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision.""
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, there is no description of a past initiated action.

    - Emotional indicators: Implied despair/hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on."" This specifies a method (overdose) and the means/substances (Benadryl, Prozac, specific amounts). The phrase ""Have 1g..."" indicates possession, which is a form of preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""soon"" indicates a current/future intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/end life.

345,"I'm Lonely. I don't know why but I'm constantly feeling alone. When I was in kinder I was always bullied and I didn't really make much friends. The neighbors that I had before were my playmates, but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I'm sorry if this was too long a read.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" (specific method, past uncompleted action). ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood."" (visualization of death, implies method). ""My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it."" (explicit mention of suicide and desire to act).
    - Emotional indicators: ""Lonely,"" ""constantly feeling alone,"" ""don't fit in,"" ""inconvenience,"" ""coward for not going through with it."" (Hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, self-criticism).
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""knife to my wrist"" is a specific method. While referring to past actions, the current desire (""I feel like I just need to do it"") and the feeling of being a ""coward for not going through with it"" suggest this method is still actively considered or linked to their current suicidal ideation. The visualization of ""dead in a pool of my own blood"" also aligns with this method. No explicit current preparations like notes or acquiring new means are mentioned.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" This describes a past action where a method was present and initiated (knife to wrist), but the lethal part (the cut) was explicitly *not completed*. This is a crucial distinction for 'Attempt'.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""I feel like I just need to do it"" indicates a current, strong desire.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die/commit suicide (""I feel like I just need to do it"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide"" and ""I feel like I just need to do it.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I feel like I just need to do it.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they express a desire to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""knife to my wrist"" is a specific method. Although it refers to past *uncompleted* actions, the current desire (""I feel like I just need to do it"") and the feeling of being a ""coward"" for not completing it strongly imply this method is still part of their current suicidal thoughts and considerations. The visualization of ""dead in a pool of my own blood"" further reinforces this.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit current preparations are mentioned (e.g., writing a note, acquiring new means). However, the specific method is present in their thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        - Past: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" This describes a past *gestural/preparatory action* but explicitly states the *lethal action* (the cut) was *not completed*.
        - Current/Future: ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead..."" and ""I feel like I just need to do it."" These are current thoughts and desires.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? The past actions (""knife to my wrist... couldn't cut"") do not meet the definition of a *completed* or *initiated potentially lethal action* that was then interrupted or failed. The explicit ""couldn't cut"" means the lethal part of the action was not initiated. Therefore, it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and a desire to die (""I feel like I just need to do it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post mentions a specific method (""knife to my wrist"") which is clearly linked to their current suicidal thoughts and feelings (feeling like a ""coward"" for not going through with it, imagining the bloody outcome). This presence of a specific method, even if from past uncompleted actions, when combined with current intent, moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    - The past actions described (""couldn't cut"") explicitly state that the lethal act was *not completed*. This means it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt', which requires an *initiated potentially lethal action*.

Based on the explicit personal desire to die and the mention of a specific method (knife to wrist) that is clearly part of their current suicidal contemplation, the post best fits 'Behavior'.

    - Emotional indicators: ""fucked up stuff,"" ""not entirely a good person,"" ""need to feel loved,"" ""is there any hope of still being loved despite it?"" - These indicate feelings of unworthiness, despair, and a longing for connection, which are emotional distress indicators.

    - References to past actions: ""I have done fucked up stuff,"" ""everything I have been through and everything I have done to others"" - These refer to general past actions, not past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: ""before I kill myself"" implies a future intention, but it's conditional on not feeling loved, not an immediate, fixed timeline.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die (""kill myself"") if the condition of feeling loved is not met. This is not expressing distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts; it's a direct statement of intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""I would like to feel that before I kill myself"" clearly indicates a desire to die if the preceding condition is not met.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement is a conditional intent to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""before I kill myself"") contingent on a condition. It also mentions general past actions, but not past suicidal actions.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, explicit personal expression of suicidal intent (""kill myself"") and a desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - It explicitly states ""kill myself"" and a desire to die, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated action* that was potentially lethal. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""kill myself"") but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparations. This aligns directly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

348,"To anyone that might read this. During lockdown here in Denmark, we had a long winter. I've always felt I've never done what I set out to do and never really connected with people. The lockdown and cold winter put everything that much more true. I've never felt as alone as I did there. I was very depressed, bored and lots of anxiety. Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write. Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful and even more so to the ones that's suffered so much. For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""what if I wasn't in this world"", ""on the verge on becoming suicidal"", ""suicidal thoughts"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""alone"", ""depressed"", ""bored"", ""anxiety"", ""couldn't sleep"".
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: Describes past feelings and thoughts (""During lockdown... At some point my thoughts came to... These thoughts scared me... It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out."").
    - Imminence: No current or future intention. The post is reflective and then offers advice.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states that the suicidal thoughts ""scared me"" and they ""never really thought I would act it out."" The primary sentiment is distress about past unwanted thoughts and then offering support/advice to others.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""on the verge on becoming suicidal.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The thoughts of ""what if I wasn't in this world"" are presented as something that ""scared"" the author, and they explicitly state they ""never really thought I would act it out."" The post then pivots to offering advice and emphasizing the beauty of life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out."" This indicates the thoughts were unwanted and not acted upon.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past feelings and thoughts during a lockdown period. There is no current or future intention of suicide.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. It describes *thoughts* and being ""on the verge on becoming suicidal,"" but explicitly states ""Never really thought I would act it out.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post discusses past ""suicidal thoughts"" and being ""on the verge on becoming suicidal."" However, it explicitly states these thoughts ""scared me"" and that the author ""never really thought I would act it out."" There is no current personal desire to die or suicidal intent expressed. The post concludes by offering advice to others experiencing suicidal thoughts.
    - This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die.""
    - It is not 'Ideation' because there is no *current* personal desire to die. The past thoughts were unwanted and not acted upon.
    - It is not 'Behavior' as there is no plan, method, or preparation.
    - It is not 'Attempt' as no specific, potentially lethal action was initiated.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""end myself,"" ""end it.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""really depressed and sad atm,"" ""crying basically all night.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""tonight,"" ""overdose."" The phrase ""again"" suggests a past attempt, but the current statement is about a future action.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""end myself again,"" ""end it tonight again."" This indicates a history of suicidal behavior, but the core statement is about a *future* intention.
    *   **Imminence:** ""tonight.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to ""end myself"" / ""end it.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly states ""I think i'm gonna try to end myself.""
    *   Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""end it"").
    *   No, the desire is not negated; it's stated as an intention.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""Probably by trying to overdose.""
    *   The imminence (""tonight"") combined with the method constitutes a clear plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a *future intention* (""gonna try to end myself again tonight"").
    *   While ""again"" implies a past attempt, the post *does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently*. It describes a *future intent* to act. The 'Attempt' category requires a description of an *initiated action*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes a specific method (""overdose"") and a timeframe (""tonight""), which constitutes a plan. This rules out 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method).
    *   Although the word ""again"" suggests a past attempt, the post's primary focus is on a *future action* (""I think i'm gonna try to end myself again tonight"") with a specific method. It does not describe a past *initiated action* in detail as required for 'Attempt'. The presence of a current plan and method places it squarely in 'Behavior'.

350,"I think my time on this earth is coming to an end in the next month or two. It's like when a cat knows they're dying and they go into some dark corner to die. That's almost how I feel. I know I'm at the end. I can't fight anymore, I can't try anymore. When you're so tired that your eyelids feel as heavy as boulders, that's how I feel with life and its pain. For anyone who has read this, thank you. Even if just one person reads this, it means a lot to me that you did. Some people just aren't meant for this world, and that's okay. My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""know they're dying,"" ""I'm at the end,"" ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""can't fight anymore, I can't try anymore""), despair (""so tired,"" ""life and its pain,"" ""tortured soul"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, or specific preparations (like writing a note or acquiring means). The ""thank you"" is general, not a specific farewell.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""in the next month or two"" suggests a future timeframe, but not immediate.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to die as a release from pain (""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, very clearly. Phrases like ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I'm at the end,"" and ""My death will release my pain"" all indicate a desire to die. The cat analogy reinforces this.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire for death is presented as a desired outcome to end suffering.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of despair and a future intention (""coming to an end in the next month or two"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die and a sense of being at the end of life, which goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive any longer, without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain .

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it,"" ""I'm ready to do it,"" ""about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills,"" ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""I hope I can get the peace i need.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Run out of options,"" ""hit rock bottom,"" ""complete failure,"" ""horrible and fake,"" ""fucked everything up,"" ""too overwhelming,"" ""can't bear the thought,"" ""shame,"" ""awful,"" ""scared."" High level of despair, hopelessness, and overwhelm.

    - References to past actions: Mentions a past ""mental breakdown"" but no past *suicidal actions*.
    - Imminence: ""about to lock myself,"" ""It's currently 6 in the morning here,"" ""I'm ready to do it."" The intention is immediate.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I'm ready to do it,"" ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""I hope I can get the peace i need."" While there's internal conflict (""I don't want to do this but I've run out of options""), the overall intent and readiness to act with a specific plan are clear.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide is on my mind.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm ready to do it,"" ""I hope I can get the peace i need.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states ""I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options."" However, this is immediately followed by a detailed, imminent plan, indicating that despite the internal conflict, the intent to act is present and strong. The desire to end suffering outweighs the desire not to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes. Method: ""knife and some pills."" Location: ""bathroom.""
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""about to lock myself in the bathroom.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily a current/future, imminent intention (""about to lock myself"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. It describes a *plan* for an imminent action, not a past *attempt*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The post includes a specific plan, method, and preparations (""lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills,"" ""about to lock myself""), which goes beyond mere ideation. This rules out 'Ideation'.
    - The post describes an imminent plan but does not describe a past or very recent *initiated action* that was potentially lethal. This rules out 'Attempt'.

352,Even when the 'fog' has lifted I still have no interest in modern life. I get windows of relief which is nice.but yet suicidal thoughts constantly round and round. I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day. What's really worrying is I'm 26 now and each year has got worse yes there's lots of factors but there's levels of depression I didn't think we're possible. As you all well know,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""no interest in modern life,"" ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible,"" ""each year has got worse.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day."" While no specific method is named, the *act* of contemplating method is a direct engagement with the practicalities of a suicidal act, which is a component of planning.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""constantly round and round"" suggests ongoing and persistent thoughts.
    - Writer's stated desire: The presence of ""suicidal thoughts constantly"" and actively ""contemplating method"" indicates a personal struggle with suicidal intent and engagement with the idea of carrying it out.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Explicitly mentions ""suicide"": Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"".
    - Expresses a clear desire to die: The context of constant suicidal thoughts and contemplating method strongly implies a desire or serious engagement with the idea of dying by suicide. It's not stated as an unwanted thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method is named (e.g., ""pills,"" ""gun"").
    - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations mentioned.
    - However, the phrase ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" is critical. This indicates active engagement with the *how* of suicide, which constitutes a form of planning, even if the specific method isn't disclosed. It goes beyond merely having suicidal thoughts; it involves thinking about the means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Describes a past event, current/future intention: Current/ongoing intention (""constantly round and round,"" ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"").
    - Describes a specific, potentially lethal action initiated in the past/recently: No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is clear, personal suicidal intent and engagement with ""method.""
    - The presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" confirms it's at least 'Ideation'.
    - The key distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is thoughts/desire without a plan/method. 'Behavior' includes thoughts/desire *with* a plan, method, or preparations. The phrase ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" signifies active engagement with the *means* or *how* to commit suicide. While a specific method isn't named, the *act of contemplating method* is a direct step towards planning. This moves it beyond pure ideation into the realm of 'Behavior' as it indicates a degree of planning or consideration of means.
    - Not 'Attempt' as no past initiated action is described.

Therefore, the contemplation of ""method"" pushes this into 'Behavior'.

I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a clear, specific, and lethal method of self-harm/suicide. ""Suicide hotline"" is also mentioned, linking the thought to suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what to do,"" ""I feel like I'm a fuck up,"" ""can never get anything right,"" ""genuinely stupid human being,"" ""can't think for herself."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and low self-worth.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a specific method. The person is ""sitting in my car right now,"" which provides the immediate means/context for this plan.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""sitting in my car right now thinking of driving..."" indicates a current, active thought process with potential for immediate action.
    - Writer's stated desire: The thought of driving into a tree implies a desire to die. The hesitation about calling a hotline is due to fear of consequences, not a negation of the suicidal thought itself.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide hotline"" is mentioned, and the thought of ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the specific lethal plan indicates a desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is expressing distress about the situation and fear of being locked up, but not that they *don't want* the suicidal thoughts or to act on them. The thought is presented as a current consideration.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a very specific method and location. The person is ""sitting in my car right now,"" indicating they are in immediate proximity to the means.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Being in the car, contemplating the act, is a form of immediate preparation/proximity to means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current thought and intention (""sitting in my car right now thinking of driving..."").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, this is a current thought/plan, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator': There is clear, personal, and explicit suicidal intent with a specific method.
    - Not 'Ideation': While ideation is present, the mention of a specific plan/method (""driving 100 mph into a tree"") and the current context (""sitting in my car right now"") moves it beyond mere thoughts into the 'Behavior' category.
    - Not 'Attempt': No past initiated action is described. The post describes a current thought/plan, not a completed or interrupted past act.
    - Fits 'Behavior': The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"") AND mentions a specific plan/method (""driving 100 mph into a tree""). The person is currently in the car, which is the immediate means for this method. This constitutes a specific plan.

    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/not be alive (""I don't see any future,"" ""joining her as well,"" ""my passing"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""I've struggled with suicide before"" and ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well,"" ""pain I will cause with my passing.""
    - Yes, clear desire to die.
    - No negation of desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for the *current* suicidal thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both past events (""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."") and future intentions (""once my mum passes I will be joining her as well,"" ""pain I will cause with my passing"").
    - The phrase ""I was hospitalised for it previously"" is crucial. Hospitalization *for* suicide implies a concrete, potentially lethal action was initiated or a severe crisis requiring intervention occurred, aligning with the definition of an 'Attempt'. It is not merely thinking about an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses current suicidal ideation (""I don't see any future,"" ""joining her as well,"" ""my passing""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - While there's no *current* plan/method mentioned, the post explicitly describes a *past* event: ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" This phrase strongly implies a past initiated action or a severe crisis that led to intervention, which fits the definition of 'Attempt'. The 'Attempt' definition explicitly states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death... If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The hospitalization due to suicide is a clear description of a past event.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" (in the context of intense, unresolvable suffering) strongly imply a desire to end their life.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Nothing, nothing changes,"" ""Nothing makes it go away,"" ""I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head""), despair (""My mind is hell,"" ""eating my mind every night,"" ""tear me down every night""), feeling ""stupid"" and ""weak.""
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" suggests a sense of urgency.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses being ""tired of living"" and needing to ""stop it"" because ""nothing makes it go away."" This indicates a clear desire to end their current state of existence, which, given the severe emotional pain, points towards a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I wake up even more tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" (in the context of overwhelming despair and lack of relief) convey a clear desire to end their life or current suffering.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to ""stop it,"" which implies acting on the underlying thoughts/feelings.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current ongoing suffering and a future intention (""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress. The phrases ""tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" clearly indicate a personal desire to end their life or current state of being, which is a core component of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal feelings of suicidal thoughts/desire to not be alive, but without a plan or method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""constantly contemplate suicide"", ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't want to anymore"" (repeated), ""hate cooking, I hate cleaning, I hate taking care of myself,"" ""tired and exhausted,"" ""fucked up my brain,"" ""depressed,"" ""don't know where I want to go,"" ""don't know anything anymore."" These show significant distress, anhedonia, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""I tried making some art"" (not suicidal). ""All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide"" (contemplation, not an action).
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""constantly contemplate suicide"" indicates ongoing thoughts, not an immediate plan. The phrase ""I hope I'll get out of this soon. But maybe I won't. And that's life too."" suggests a sense of resignation rather than immediate intent.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire not to be here (""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"") and explicit mention of ""constantly contemplate suicide.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""constantly contemplate suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the contemplation is presented as a current, ongoing state, and the desire not to be here is expressed.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and ongoing contemplation (""constantly contemplate suicide"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The contemplation of suicide is a thought process, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts (""constantly contemplate suicide"") and a desire not to be alive (""Would've been better for me to not be here at all""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly asks ""When to know if suicide is better."" It also refers to ""the release is better as their life is a bust,"" which strongly implies death as a release.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""trauma, ocd, anhedonia, no friends, abuse,"" ""life is a bust,"" ""impossible situation."" These indicate profound distress, hopelessness, and a sense of life being unbearable.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparations (e.g., writing notes, saying goodbye) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions living with trauma etc. since age 12/13. No past *suicidal actions* are described.
    *   **Imminence:** ""When to know if suicide is better"" is a contemplation, not an immediate statement of intent, but it is a direct consideration of suicide.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer is personally contemplating if ""suicide is better"" and if ""the release is better."" This indicates a personal desire to escape suffering through death.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide is better.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrasing ""the release is better as their life is a bust"" in the context of asking about suicide clearly indicates a desire for the release that death would bring.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite; they are exploring if it *is* a better option.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past suffering and a current contemplation of suicide as a potential future solution.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a personal consideration of it as a ""better"" option and a desire for ""release."" This moves it beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts (Indicator) because there is a clear personal contemplation and desire for death/suicide.
    *   However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of any past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I wanna go sleep forever"" is a clear euphemism for wanting to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""can't take this shit no more,"" ""sick and tired of my shitty life"" indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** The post explicitly states ""I have 58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg"". This is a specific mention of substances (medications) and their quantities, indicating a clear method (overdose) and means (the pills themselves).
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I wanna go sleep"" suggests a current desire and potential imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, stated desire to die (""go sleep forever"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wanna go sleep forever"" is a clear expression of a desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present and not negated.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, the mention of specific medications (seroquel, viepax) and their quantities (""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg"") constitutes a clear method (overdose) and the means (the pills).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Possessing the specific medications and stating the intent to ""go sleep forever"" with them implies preparation for an overdose.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention (""I wanna go sleep forever"") and the current possession of specific means.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes a current intention and possession of means, not an *initiated action*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I wanna go sleep forever""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post *also* explicitly mentions specific medications and their quantities (""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg"") as the means, implying a method (overdose). This presence of a specific method/means goes beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not describe a past or very recent *initiated action*, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it best fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a specific method/means.

    - Emotional indicators: ""I hate myself so much,"" ""I am scared,"" ""I can't do it,"" ""don't want to traumatize anyone."" (Despair, self-loathing, fear, ambivalence).
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations:

        - Current/Future: ""I have a rope"" (possession of a means), ""There's a building"" (potential location).
    - References to past actions: ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times,"" ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" These are descriptions of initiated actions.
    - Imminence: ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have to do it."" Suggests a strong current drive.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I want this to end,"" ""I have to do it."" Clear desire to die/end life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but the context of past attempts, current means, and desire for it ""to end"" strongly implies suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want this to end,"" ""I have to do it.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the ambivalence is about the fear/traumatizing others, not a desire to live.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""knife"" (past action), ""rope"" (current means), ""building"" (potential location).
    - Are there signs of preparation? ""I have a rope"" is a sign of acquiring means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes. ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This explicitly describes a past self-initiated action that was potentially lethal, even though it ""didn't work."" The phrase ""tried and bailed out multiple times"" further reinforces past initiated actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear descriptions of past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (""I tried with a knife. It didn't work.""). This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt' (""describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death"").
    - While there is also current ideation (""I want this to end,"" ""I have to do it"") and mention of current means/plans (""I have a rope,"" ""There's a building""), the presence of a described past *attempt* takes precedence according to the rules: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""I just want to end it"" strongly implies a desire to end life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Tired of it,"" ""No point to anything in life with depression,"" ""I feel pain,"" ""useless,"" ""most useless pos,"" ""A fly is worth more than i am."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, and feelings of being a burden/worthless.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but ""I just want to end it"" is a current desire.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated wish to ""end it,"" which in this context means to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to end it"" in the context of extreme despair and worthlessness clearly expresses a desire to die or cease existing.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the desire to ""end it"" is presented as a personal wish.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Conclusion: No plan, method, or preparation is identified.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention (""I just want to end it"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to ""end it"" (die), coupled with intense feelings of hopelessness, pain, and worthlessness. This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, indicating a personal suicidal intent. Therefore, it's not 'Indicator'.
    - However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation to carry out this desire. This absence means it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the explicit personal expression of a desire to die (""I just want to end it"") without any plan or method, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow."" This indicates a desire to die or not be alive.
    - Suicide/self-harm/methods: ""attempt properly again."" This is a direct reference to a past suicidal act that was initiated.
    - Emotional indicators: ""depressed,"" ""Tired of being alone."" (Hopelessness, despair, loneliness).
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No specific plan or method is mentioned for a *future* attempt. However, the word ""attempt"" itself refers to a past initiated action.
    - References to past actions: ""attempt properly again"" clearly indicates a past, initiated suicidal action.
    - Imminence: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" suggests a desire for immediate cessation of life, though it's immediately qualified by ""But I will, as always."" The *future* potential attempt is linked to Christmas.
    - Stated desire: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" is a clear desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" expresses a clear desire to die. ""attempt properly again"" implies suicidal intent.
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive.
    - No negation of desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a *future* act.
    - However, the crucial element here is the reference to a *past* initiated action: ""attempt properly again."" This implies a past specific action, even if the details aren't provided.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past event (""attempt properly again""), a current desire (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow""), and a future intention (""that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"").
    - The key is the phrase ""attempt properly again."" This describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past. The definition of 'Attempt' explicitly covers ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The phrase ""attempt properly again"" fits this perfectly as it refers to a concrete, initiated suicidal act in the past.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear ideation (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"").
    - It also explicitly mentions a *past attempt*: ""attempt properly again."" The 'Attempt' definition states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The phrase ""attempt properly again"" is a clear description of a past, initiated action, making 'Attempt' the most appropriate category.

364,Can someone harvest my organs?. Hi i am looking for someone to kill me and hide my body so that my family will never find out. I am happy for u to chop me up as long as i never get found again,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""kill me"", ""never get found again"", ""chop me up"".
    - Emotional indicators: A strong desire for cessation of life and to not be found, implying deep despair or hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""I am looking for someone to kill me and hide my body"". This is a specific desired method (being killed by another person) and a plan for what should happen afterward (""hide my body"", ""chop me up"").
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The phrase ""I am looking for someone to kill me"" indicates a current, active desire for this plan to be carried out.
    - Writer's stated desire: A very clear and explicit desire to die and not be found.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? While not ""kill myself,"" the phrase ""looking for someone to kill me"" is a direct expression of intent to die via a lethal act.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I am looking for someone to kill me"" and ""as long as i never get found again"" clearly express a desire to die and cease to exist.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively seeking to act on this desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, the method is being killed by another person, and the post specifies actions to be taken with the body (""hide my body"", ""chop me up""). This is a specific, albeit externalized, method for achieving death.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The act of ""looking for someone"" to carry out the act is a form of preparation or seeking means to execute the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention/desire for a future action (""I am looking for someone to kill me"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, this is a current desire/plan, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is incorrect because there is a clear, explicit personal desire to die.
    - 'Ideation' is incorrect because there is more than just a desire to die; there is a specific method being sought and details about what should happen.
    - 'Behavior' is the best fit. The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire (""looking for someone to kill me"") AND mentions a specific method (""someone to kill me"", ""hide my body"", ""chop me up""). The act of ""looking for someone"" also implies a step towards executing a plan.
    - 'Attempt' is incorrect because no past or very recent initiated action is described.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly indicates a desire to die along with a specific method/plan involving another person.

Every fucking day, something just snaps on in my head and then I'm fantasizing about my death. I fight to suppress them; some days are easier than others. Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here. I have no desire to die. But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""fighting down suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death,"" ""some days I consider it"" (implying considering suicide).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fed up,"" ""rock bottom lows,"" ""fight to suppress them,"" ""so fed up with fighting this crap.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""10 years that I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts."" This refers to a long-term struggle with thoughts, not a past initiated suicidal act.
    *   **Imminence:** ""Every fucking day,"" ""some days I consider it."" No immediate or specific timeline for action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Crucially, the post states, ""I have no desire to die."" This indicates the thoughts are unwanted and not reflective of a genuine wish to die, despite their presence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The post explicitly states, ""I have no desire to die.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I fight to suppress them,"" and ""I have no desire to die."" The primary sentiment is distress *about* the unwanted thoughts, rather than a desire to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes an ongoing, long-term struggle with thoughts (""10 years,"" ""Every fucking day"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. It describes fighting *thoughts*, not initiating a physical act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death,"" which might initially suggest 'Ideation'.
    *   However, the definition of 'Ideation' requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" The author explicitly negates this by stating, ""I have no desire to die.""
    *   The 'Indicator' definition specifically states: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" This perfectly matches the user's statement of having suicidal thoughts but ""no desire to die"" and ""fighting to suppress them."" The ""some days I consider it"" is framed as being ""fed up with fighting this crap,"" reinforcing the idea that the consideration stems from exhaustion with the unwanted thoughts, not a genuine desire for death.
    *   There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal act, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the explicit negation of a desire to die, despite the presence of suicidal thoughts, places this post firmly in the 'Indicator' category.

366,"My problems are getting worse, and I just really wish to end my life, but I just can't. Every day, I'm struggling more and more with my problems. I was emotionally neglected by my parents, and searching for the love and attention I never got is the only thing keeping my alive. Every thing I do is controlled by this. It usually starts by seeing someone getting praised for something, which leads to me thinking that I need to be able to do/ have these things to be loved. Every time I see things as simple as a drawing, just gets me more and more depressed. I can't go to a therapist or something like that, because my mom's mad at me for being even sad in the slightest. I can't talk a single word about mental health at all, without being scared that she will scream at me another time. I feel like I'm unimportant. Other people have problems much worse than mine. They deserve being cared for, unlike me. Hearing other people's problems just makes me feel sad, and envious, because these people are getting all this love that I never got, and I never will get.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""wish to end my life"", ""end all this"", ""can't harm myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""problems are getting worse"", ""struggling more and more"", ""depressed"", ""scared"", ""unimportant"", ""sad"", ""envious"", ""no more options"".
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post explicitly states ""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest.""
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide/self-harm.
    - Imminence: The desire to end life is stated as a current feeling (""wish to end my life"", ""no more options here"").
    - Assessed desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die (""wish to end my life"", ""end all this""). However, there is also a stated inability to act on this desire (""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""wish to end my life"" and ""end all this"" are direct expressions of a desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just really wish to end my life,"" ""I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states an *inability* to act (""I just can't harm myself""), not a lack of desire for the outcome or a rejection of the thoughts themselves. The desire to die is present.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - The post explicitly negates the presence of a plan/method/preparation by stating ""The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention (""wish to end my life"", ""end all this"") and a current inability to act on it.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""wish to end my life"", ""end all this""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - Crucially, the post explicitly states an *inability* to harm oneself (""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest""), which means there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of a clear desire to die, coupled with the absence of a plan (and even an explicit statement of inability to act), places it squarely in 'Ideation'.

367,I lost control. I've lost control of my head I just want to cry I can't breathe I want to scream help please I don't want to live this again,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No.
    - Emotional indicators: ""lost control,"" ""can't breathe,"" ""want to scream help,"" ""don't want to live this again."" These indicate extreme distress, overwhelm, and a desire for current suffering to cease.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""don't want to live this again"" implies a past negative experience that the author does not wish to repeat. It does not describe a past suicidal action.
    - Imminence: The distress is immediate, but no specific timeframe for suicidal action is mentioned.
    - Asses the writer's stated desire: The core phrase is ""I don't want to live this again."" This expresses a desire to escape a current painful state. It is ambiguous whether this directly translates to a desire to die or merely a desire for the current suffering to end. It's not a clear ""I want to die.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? ""I don't want to live this again"" is the closest. While it expresses extreme distress and a wish for the current situation to end, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or end one's life. It could mean ""I don't want to experience this specific painful situation again.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current state of intense emotional distress.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness (""lost control,"" ""can't breathe,"" ""want to scream help"").
    - The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" is critical. While it conveys a profound wish for suffering to end, it lacks the explicit personal expression of a desire to die or suicidal intent that would categorize it as 'Ideation'. It's more about escaping a painful experience.
    - According to the definitions, 'Indicator' applies when there's ""general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" It also states: ""**If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.**""
    - There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated potentially lethal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, given the ambiguity of ""I don't want to live this again"" regarding a direct desire to die, and the overwhelming presence of general distress, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category.

And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO.

    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" This is a clear preparation.

    - Imminence: ""why I decided this is it"" (past decision, implies current state). The note is already left.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to die (""my reason to die,"" ""why I decided this is it"").

    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" Leaving a note is a form of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past decision (""I decided this is it"") and a past action (""I left a note""). The context suggests these are recent or ongoing actions related to current despair.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes leaving a note, which is a preparation, not an initiated potentially lethal act itself.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""my reason to die,"" ""why I decided this is it""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly mentions a preparation for suicide: ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" This moves it beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method/preparation).

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since."" and ""I just. Want. To die."" Most critically, it asks, ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" This is a direct inquiry about a method/means for suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: Overwhelming despair, self-loathing (""unstable freak,"" ""creep,"" ""short ugly bastard""), hopelessness (""no prospects,"" ""can't keep doing this anymore""), feeling like a burden (""don't want to be a burden anymore""), loneliness, and a sense of failure.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: While no specific method is *stated* as chosen, the question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" is a direct inquiry about finding a method or plan, with a specific constraint (not leaving a body). This indicates an active search for means, which falls under the 'Behavior' category.
    - References to past actions: Mentions past ideation (""screamed that I wanted to die"" in middle school) and being ""fired for being suicidal"" (indicating past suicidal thoughts/behavior, but not a concrete attempt).
    - Imminence: ""I just. Want. To die."" and ""I can't keep doing this anymore."" The question about *how* to kill oneself implies a current, active consideration.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear and explicit desire to die is stated multiple times (""I just. Want. To die."").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""I want to die.""
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die.
    - No, the desire is not negated or unwanted; it's a direct expression of intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, the post asks ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"". This is a direct inquiry about a specific method or plan, and implies seeking information to carry out the act, even if the method itself isn't yet decided or stated. This moves beyond mere ideation into actively seeking means/planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both past ideation and current/future intention to die.
    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. The mention of being ""fired for being suicidal"" refers to past thoughts/behavior, not a concrete attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is incorrect because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent.
    - 'Ideation' is incorrect because the post goes beyond just expressing a desire to die or suicidal thoughts; it actively seeks information about *how* to commit suicide, which constitutes an engagement with finding a method/plan.
    - 'Behavior' is the best fit. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire (""I just. Want. To die."") AND it directly inquires about a specific method/plan (""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?""). This active search for a method, even if not a specific *chosen* method, falls under the definition of mentioning a plan or method.
    - 'Attempt' is incorrect because no past or very recent initiated suicidal action is described.

The ""eternal void"" and ""free from it all"" strongly suggest death. ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" implies active intervention.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, anhedonia (nothing makes me truly happy, everything is lame).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. There are no specific tools, locations, substances, or preparatory actions described. ""One last push"" is metaphorical, not a concrete method.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""One last push is all I need"" suggests a current desire to act, but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and strong stated desire to die and end their suffering, not just expressing distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly using those exact words.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""No point in it all,"" ""I wasn't meant for this world,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" clearly express a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a future intention to end things (""One last push is all I need"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die or end their life (""free from it all,"" ""eternal void,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific pills, a gun, a bridge, writing a note). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

    *   **Imminence:** No imminence is indicated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer is discussing suicide in a general, empathetic, and explanatory context, explaining *why* people might commit suicide. There is no personal expression of a desire to die or current suicidal intent from the author themselves. The use of ""we"" appears to be a collective ""we"" (referring to people in general), not a personal ""I"" or ""we"" indicating the author's own current suicidal thoughts or feelings.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""commit suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The mention of suicide is in the context of a general commentary/explanation, not a personal statement of intent or desire from the author.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as no personal suicidal thoughts are expressed.
    *   If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. In this case, suicide is mentioned, but the *desire* for it is not expressed by the author for themselves.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a general process that *leads* people to suicide, not a specific past action by the author, nor a current/future intention.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses suicide abstractly and generally, explaining the reasons *people* might reach that point.
    *   It does *not* contain a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The author is making an observation about suicide, not expressing personal suicidal thoughts or plans.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.""

I dont owe anybody anything and if they have a problem with that too bad because I'd  be dead.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""If I kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever"" and ""I'd be dead"".
    - Emotional indicators: Strong anger, resentment, and a desire to spite others (""fuck everyone I knew"", ""I dont owe anybody shit"", ""leave a giant middle finger""). The underlying emotion is clearly despair/hopelessness, channeled into anger.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None are mentioned. There is no indication of *how* the person would kill themselves or any steps being taken.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: None. The statement is conditional (""If I kill myself"") and refers to a potential future action.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No specific timeline is given (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). It's a conditional statement.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die (""If I kill myself"", ""leave this world forever""). The anger seems to be a strong motivator for this desire.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""If I kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just wanna leave a giant middle finger before I leave this world forever"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to die is clearly expressed and seems to be the author's current sentiment.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a conditional future intention (""If I kill myself"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""If I kill myself"", ""leave this world forever""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., how they would do it, what they would use, where they would go, or any actions being taken to prepare). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal intent without a specific plan or method.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances. Life isn't about making something happen, it's about taking opportunities that come to you, and I feel like none have come to me except one.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live."" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" This indicates a desire for death. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""tired of having to live,"" ""frustrated,"" ""demoralising,"" ""constant feeling of dread and anxiety,"" ""hate it,"" ""feel nothing anymore,"" ""constant state of anxiety and/or depression."" These show severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and anhedonia.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""tired of having to live"" implies current distress. ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" indicates a future outlook of death, not necessarily immediate, but a clear desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire to die or not be alive (""tired of having to live,"" ""Dead"" in response to future outlook).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live."" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" clearly express a desire for death/not being alive.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire for death is presented as a personal outlook/wish.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current struggles and a future intention to be dead.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. There is no mention of a past or recent initiated suicidal act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""tired of having to live,"" ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead.""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation. This means it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This means it does not fit 'Attempt'.

374,⚠️TW⚠️ (I think) Question. If someone wants to kill their self for what ever reason Maybe to end their pain why do people stop them?. (No hate). (Asking for a personal reason),0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""wants to kill their self"" is explicitly stated.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""end their pain"" indicates significant distress and a desire for relief from suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** No specific timeline is given.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The post is framed as a question about why people stop someone who wants to kill themselves to end their pain. The crucial part is ""(Asking for a personal reason)"". This strongly implies that the author is personally experiencing or contemplating these thoughts and feelings, making the desire to end pain through suicide a personal one, even if phrased indirectly. It's not an abstract philosophical question.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill their self.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the combination of ""wants to kill their self... to end their pain"" and ""(Asking for a personal reason)"" strongly indicates a personal identification with this desire. The question ""why do people stop them?"" further suggests a personal contemplation of this action.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the phrasing suggests a personal struggle with the idea of being stopped, implying a desire to *not* be stopped, or at least a deep contemplation of the desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current contemplation or question about a desire to die.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') because it explicitly mentions ""kill their self"" and ""end their pain"" in a context that is personally relevant to the author (""Asking for a personal reason""). This indicates a personal expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die to alleviate pain.
    *   It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe any initiated past or very recent action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation', as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (to end pain) without a specific plan.

So some how she convince me not to. Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday faking everything I do and every hour on till I go to sleep suicide by a train is on my mind. I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday 🥳. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""suicidal,"" ""jumping in and drowning,"" ""suicide by a train,"" ""put neck on the train tracks.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""depressed,"" ""faking everything I do.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""jumping in and drowning"" (past thought/method), ""suicide by a train"" (current/future method), ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" (future plan with specific timing), ""put neck on the train tracks"" (specific action within the method).
    - References to past actions: ""I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning... So some how she convince me not to."" This describes a past *thought* or *intention* that was prevented, not an initiated potentially lethal action.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""on my 18th birthday"" (future, specific date).
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/commit suicide is expressed (""suicide by a train is on my mind,"" ""planning on doing it"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicide by a train.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive by stating a plan to commit suicide.
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""train,"" ""drowning"" in the past thought), location (""train tracks,"" ""lake"" in the past thought), and a future plan (""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"") are mentioned. The question about ""instantly kill me"" further clarifies the focus on the method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both a past event (thinking about drowning at 10/11) and a current/future intention (suicide by train at 18).
    - The past event (""I thought jumping in and drowning... she convince me not to"") does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated. It was a thought/intention that was stopped before initiation. Therefore, it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.
    - The current intention is a future plan, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post includes a specific plan, method, and timing (""suicide by a train,"" ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday,"" ""put neck on the train tracks""). This presence of a plan/method rules out 'Ideation'.
    - The past event described was a thought/intention, not an initiated action. The current plan is for the future. Therefore, it does not meet the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - The content clearly falls under 'Behavior' due to the explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific plan, method, and preparations (planning for a future date, inquiring about the method's lethality).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""tried to end his life"" (referring to someone else), ""keep thinking about it,"" ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Triggered,"" ""rougher weeks,"" ""can't really explain why I feel like this,"" ""don't want to think like this anymore.""
    - Specific plans, methods, preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""had some suicidal thoughts through my life, but most of them are behind me."" Refers to someone else's attempt.
    - Imminence: ""keep thinking about it,"" ""now ok to try"" (implies a current thought process, not an immediate plan).
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states, ""But I just don´t want to think like this anymore."" This is a key indicator that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted and distressing to the author, rather than a personal desire to die or act on them.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try"" (in the context of ending life).
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? While the phrase ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try"" suggests a consideration, the concluding sentence ""But I just don´t want to think like this anymore"" clearly negates a personal desire to act on these thoughts. The author is expressing distress about *having* the thoughts.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I just don´t want to think like this anymore."" This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past thoughts, a recent trigger (someone else's attempt), and current *unwanted* thoughts.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post mentions suicidal thoughts (""keep thinking about it,"" ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try""). However, the crucial element is the author's explicit statement, ""But I just don´t want to think like this anymore."" This indicates that the thoughts are unwanted and cause distress, rather than representing a personal desire to die. This perfectly fits the definition of 'Indicator': ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die."" There is no plan, method, preparation, or initiated action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""just want my life to end"" is a direct expression of a desire for life to cease, which is equivalent to a desire to die.
    - Emotional indicators: ""intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions, rage outbursts, followed by depressive episodes"" indicate significant mental distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not explicitly stated as immediate (e.g., ""tonight""), but the desire is current.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a genuine wish for their life to end, indicating a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""just want my life to end"" is a clear and direct expression of a desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""just want my life to end.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as their own.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""just want my life to end""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation to carry out this desire. This means it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. This means it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""nearly killing myself one night"" (past action). ""step off a building or over a bridge"" (future potential methods/locations).
    - Emotional indicators: ""disassociate,"" ""extreme dysphoria,"" ""never feeling like i'm the person i appear as,"" ""not in my body,"" ""watching someone work and live,"" ""disconnected from life,"" ""emotions never act how I want,"" ""can't feel really anything,"" ""can't feel the same or help,"" ""everything seems so far out of my touch,"" ""real life feels more as a dream,"" ""no money nor insurance,"" ""trashy past ones have treated me,"" ""caused enough trouble for my parents,"" ""constant bad moods from my dad."" These indicate severe emotional distress, depersonalization/derealization, anhedonia, hopelessness, and feelings of burden.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""step off a building,"" ""over a bridge"" are specific methods/locations for a potential future act.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: ""nearly killing myself one night"" is a clear reference to a past, initiated action.
    - Imminence: ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" suggests a potential future, possibly impulsive, action.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The desire isn't explicitly ""I want to die,"" but the closing sentence ""maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself"" in the context of stepping off a building/bridge strongly implies a desire to escape or gain control through death, which serves as a proxy for desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""nearly killing myself one night.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the statement ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself"" indicates a desire for an end to their current state, achieved through a lethal means, which implies a desire to not be alive in their current state.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the potential future action is presented as a means to gain control.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""step off a building"" and ""over a bridge"" are specific methods/locations.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly for the future plan, but the mention of specific methods/locations for a potential future act is present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        - Past: ""nearly killing myself one night""
        - Future/Potential: ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking.""
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""nearly killing myself one night"" strongly implies an initiated action that was potentially lethal but did not result in death. The word ""nearly"" indicates the action was started or very close to being completed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The presence of ""nearly killing myself one night"" is the key element. This phrase describes a past, self-initiated action that was potentially lethal, fitting the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - The definition of 'Attempt' explicitly states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" And importantly, ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
    - While the post also includes elements of 'Behavior' (future plans with specific methods), the clear description of a past initiated action takes precedence according to the rules.

Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most fitting classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""need a way out,"" ""I want to take myself out,"" ""i just need it to stop."" ""Take myself out"" is a clear euphemism for suicide. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""don't want to deal with it,"" ""disappoint and burden other people,"" ""scared it'll be painful,"" ""i just need it to stop."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and feeling like a burden.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The user asks ""what do i do, please?"" which implies a lack of a concrete plan.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""i just need it to stop"" implies a current, urgent desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and explicit wish to die (""I want to take myself out""). The fear of pain (""scared it'll be painful"") does not negate the desire to end their life but rather expresses a concern about the method.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I want to take myself out"" is a clear, direct expression of suicidal intent, even if euphemistic.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""need a way out,"" ""I want to take myself out,"" ""i just need it to stop.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly stated as personal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The user is asking for guidance (""what do i do, please?""), indicating a lack of a defined plan.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""I want to take myself out"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I want to take myself out""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out the suicidal intent. The user is asking for a ""way out"" and ""what do I do,"" which indicates the absence of a concrete plan. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it contains ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

I work 8 hours on the weekends and I like to sleep afterwords, just a nap right? Who doesn't like an after work nap? Well, apparently my family because as of today I am the most useless person alive. My grades have dropped and they are furious, calling me a failure and a disappointment. I tried to tell them how I've been feeling, as in feeling like a coward and contemplating but they don't care. All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations. That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way. It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone, they'll just have less children to feed, and less bills to pay. I want to die but I'm scared of the consequences of failure.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""thinking on how to die painlessly"", ""I want to die"", ""when I'm gone"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""killed my mental health"", ""lazy"", ""useless"", ""failure"", ""disappointment"", ""coward"", ""contemplating"", ""burnout"", ""tired of expectations"", ""scared of the consequences of failure"".
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The post explicitly states, ""but I have yet to find a way.""
    - References to past actions: No past *actions* (attempts) are described, only past *thinking* (""for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly"").
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated as immediate, but the desire is current.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""I want to die""). The fear of ""consequences of failure"" refers to the act itself, not a negation of the desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die"") and mentions ""thinking on how to die painlessly.""
    - The desire is personal and not negated.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned. The phrase ""but I have yet to find a way"" explicitly indicates the *absence* of a plan/method.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current desire to die and past *thinking* about methods.
    - No specific, potentially lethal action (attempt) is described as having been initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, explicit personal desire to die (""I want to die"").
    - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The post explicitly states the lack of a way.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past or very recent initiated action is described. Only thoughts and contemplation.
    - 'Ideation' fits best as there are explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""Must end this shit show,"" ""before I do it,"" ""So many people commit suicide,"" ""killing myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""hate"" (repeatedly), ""despair,"" ""anxious,"" ""ruined,"" ""over this shit.""
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This indicates preparation (writing goodbye notes/emails).
    - References to past actions: ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop."" (This is past ideation, not an action).
    - Imminence: ""Must end this shit show,"" ""before I do it."" (Suggests current intention).
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to end their life and not ""wuss out.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and ""commit suicide,"" and expresses a clear desire to ""end this shit show"" and ""do it.""
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they express a desire to act on them (""don't want to wuss out"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method is mentioned.
    - Yes, there is a clear sign of preparation: ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This is a form of a goodbye note/preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes past ideation (""thought about killing myself for 5 years"") and a current/future intention with preparation (""emails to send... before I do it"").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. It describes *preparing* for a future action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""killing myself,"" ""must end this shit show,"" ""very OVER this shit""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post also mentions a specific preparation: ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This concrete step towards carrying out a suicidal act, even without a stated method, moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    - There is no description of a past *initiated* suicidal action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a clear preparation (writing goodbye emails) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""Ending it soon"" clearly indicates suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""so fucking depressed,"" ""scared,"" ""fucked me up for good.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here."" This is a specific substance (method), a specific amount, and a clear statement of intent to take it upon arrival (preparation/plan).
    - References to past actions: Mentions losing a job and a bad trip, but no past *suicidal actions*.
    - Imminence: ""Ending it soon,"" ""as soon as it gets here"" indicates high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear desire to end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""Ending it soon"" is a direct phrase expressing suicidal intent.
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die.
    - No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current intention and a future plan (""Ending it soon,"" ""I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here"").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses clear personal suicidal intent (""Ending it soon""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by explicitly detailing a specific method (""14 grams of dextromethorphan"") and a plan/preparation to carry it out (""ordered... in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here""). This clearly fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe a completed or interrupted past suicidal act, so it is not 'Attempt'.

When did Human thought it would be cool living so much?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post discusses the concept of dying (""Human tend to die around 80""), and explicitly questions the desire to live (""how people can want to live?"", ""how they actually find important to stay alive?""). The phrase ""I have 60 fucking years left"" expresses a strong negative sentiment about continued existence.
    - Emotional indicators: The post conveys a sense of weariness, lack of purpose, and a strong disinterest or aversion to continued life. The use of ""fucking"" emphasizes the negative feeling about the prospect of living for 60 more years.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: References past years lived (""I 'really lived' 15 years, and it wasn't really good""), but no past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence of intentions: No imminence is stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer clearly expresses a lack of desire to live (""how people can want to live?"", ""how they actually find important to stay alive?""). The rhetorical questions imply that the author does not find importance in staying alive and does not want to live for a long time.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly but strongly. The core of the post is questioning the value and desirability of life, particularly for the author, and expressing a strong aversion to living a long life. Phrases like ""how people can want to live?"" and ""I have 60 fucking years left"" indicate a personal lack of desire to continue living.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post expresses a genuine questioning of the value of life for themselves, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of mind regarding the future (not wanting to live for 60 more years).
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it expresses a clear, personal lack of desire to live or to continue living for a long period. The rhetorical questions about why one would want to live function as a personal statement of not wanting to live.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not Behavior.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not Attempt.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of Ideation, as it includes explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer, even if phrased as questions.

Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""passive suicidal,"" ""suicidal,"" and ""suicide by cop.""
    - Emotional indicators: The author expresses frustration (""Why would people be so counterproductive?"") regarding how others might interact with suicidal individuals, not personal despair or hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for the author. The method ""suicide by cop"" is mentioned, but in the context of a hypothetical action by ""someone who's passive suicidal,"" not the author themselves.
    - References to past actions: None by the author.
    - Imminence of intentions: Not applicable to the author's own intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The author is discussing a general concept and warning about interactions with suicidal people. There is no stated desire to die or personal suicidal intent from the author.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases *by the author about themselves*? No. The mentions of suicide are in a general, cautionary context about others.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive *by the author about themselves*? No.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as the thoughts are not the author's own.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act *by the author*? No. ""Suicide by cop"" is discussed as a potential outcome for *others*, not a plan for the author.
    - Are there signs of preparation *by the author*? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a general observation and warning about how others might influence suicidal individuals. It does not describe any actions or intentions of the author.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, not for the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post discusses suicide and suicidal concepts (""passive suicidal,"" ""suicide by cop"") but does so in a general, abstract, or cautionary manner.
    - There is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, specific plan, or description of a past attempt *by the author*.
    - The author is commenting on a societal issue or a general interaction scenario related to suicide, not expressing their own personal risk.
    - This clearly fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it discusses suicide abstractly and lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.

My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens and I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens. Getting the pens is too much of a hassle though.

Had a couple ideas for how to do it, but getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible. Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/suicide/self-harm/methods:** The post states ""had a plan in mind ever since"" and ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" referring to using an insulin pump with ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button."" This clearly identifies a method (insulin overdose via pump) and an intention to die by suicide. It also mentions ""Had a couple ideas for how to do it"" and ""Thought about doing it a couple times.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life and never told anyone because I hate being a burden."" This indicates chronic depression, self-blame, and feelings of being a burden.
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** A specific method is identified: using an ""insulin pump"" for an overdose (""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button""). This is a clear method, contingent on getting the pump.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens and I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens."" This describes a past near-incident with insulin pens, but it's not explicitly stated as a *suicidal act* that was initiated; ""almost went into shock"" could imply an accidental or near-accidental event. ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up"" clearly states that past *thoughts* did not lead to *initiated actions*.
    *   **Imminence:** The intention is conditional on ""if my condition goes south quick"" and getting the pump, so it's not immediate but a clear future intention with a method.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" expresses a clear personal desire to die by suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"": No, not those exact words.
    *   Clear desire to die or not be alive: Yes, ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" in the context of a plan and method strongly indicates a desire to die.
    *   Negation of desire: No, the desire is clearly stated as a potential choice.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Specific method/tool/substance/location: Yes, ""insulin pump"" and ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" are a specific method/substance.
    *   Signs of preparation: No explicit preparations like ""writing a note"" are mentioned, but the acquisition of the pump is a prerequisite for the stated method. The identification of the specific method is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Describes past event, current/future intention, or both? Both. Past thoughts/plans (""had a plan in mind ever since,"" ""Thought about doing it a couple times"") and a future intention (""think that might be the way I choose to go"" if condition worsens and pump is acquired).
    *   Specific, potentially lethal action initiated in the past/recently? No. The ""almost went into shock"" is ambiguous and not clearly described as a *suicidal act* that was initiated. The statement ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up"" explicitly negates past *initiated actions*. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""think that might be the way I choose to go"") and mentions a specific method (""insulin pump"" for overdose). This eliminates 'Indicator' (which lacks clear personal intent) and 'Ideation' (which lacks a specific plan/method).
    *   While there are references to past thoughts, there is no description of a *past initiated, potentially lethal action* that fits the definition of 'Attempt'. The ""almost went into shock"" is too ambiguous to be classified as an attempt, and the user explicitly states they ""didn't"" act on previous thoughts.
    *   Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal desire *and* a specific method/plan points to 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly asks ""ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday?"" and then states ""well I do"". This is a direct mention of suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""☹️"", ""nobody told me happy birthday or anything"", ""walked past me like I was nothing"", ""tired of everything!"", ""Worst birthday ever!"" indicate feelings of sadness, loneliness, worthlessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" indicates an opportunity or imminence of action, but it does *not* specify a method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), a location, or any preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). It only states the desire and perceived opportunity.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions (attempts or behaviors) are described.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""right now"" suggests immediate intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""well I do"" clearly states a genuine desire to kill themselves.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? **Yes**, ""kill yourself"" and ""I do"" (referring to wanting to kill myself).
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? **Yes**, ""I do"" (want to kill myself) and ""tired of everything!"".
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? **No**, the writer affirms the desire and opportunity to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? **No**. ""I have a chance right now"" implies an opportunity but not a specific *how*.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? **No**.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention (""I do and I have a chance right now"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? **No**.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I do"" want to kill myself) and immediate intent (""I have a chance right now""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not abstract or unwanted thoughts.
    *   However, the post does *not* mention any specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., ""I have pills,"" ""I'm going to jump from X,"" ""I'm writing a note""). The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" indicates opportunity but lacks the concrete details required for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire without a specific plan, method, or preparations.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly states ""I'm finally considering suicide."" Also, ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""stressed,"" ""bawling,"" ""mental health...bad,"" ""don't want to do this anymore,"" ""so hard,"" ""crying myself to sleep,"" ""fucked up my head,"" ""confused,"" ""desolate,"" ""pathetic,"" ""this all means nothing.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The user is ""considering"" but no details on how, when, or with what.
    - References to past actions: Mentions past academic struggles, crying, but no past *suicidal actions*.
    - Imminence: ""finally considering suicide"" indicates a current state of mind. No specific timeline for action is given.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to escape the current situation and explicit mention of ""considering suicide."" The phrase ""I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents"" implies a desire to die, tempered by concern for parents. The final lines ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit"" also suggest a desire to not care about living. There is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not want to act on them.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""considering suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to do this anymore"" (in context of despair), ""I'm finally considering suicide,"" and the nihilistic ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. The writer states they are ""considering suicide"" and expresses reasons (parents) why they *haven't* acted, but not that they *don't want* the thoughts or *don't want* to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and the current state of ""considering suicide.""
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. It describes *considering* suicide, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""considering suicide,"" ""don't want to do this anymore,"" ""why should I give a shit""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., ""I'm going to take pills,"" ""I have a rope,"" ""I'm writing a note""). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated* suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.""

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: Yes. ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to,"" ""I feel like killing myself,"" ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't,"" ""I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live,"" ""I guess I'm dying alone too,"" ""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling unappreciated, isolation, feeling like a burden.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: Explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide."" Mentions calling hotlines, which is a cry for help, not an initiated suicidal act.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not explicitly stated as immediate, but the current feelings are strong.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a genuine wish to die (""despite wanting to,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would""), but also a stated lack of ""guts"" to act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes. ""attempted suicide,"" ""killing myself,"" ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes. ""despite wanting to,"" ""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would,"" ""no other reason to live,"" ""no point to it.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is present, though the ability/courage to act is questioned. The initial ""I'm fine, safe"" seems like a disclaimer, but the rest of the post contradicts this regarding internal suicidal desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and intentions (""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The post explicitly states, ""I've never actually attempted suicide."" Calling hotlines is not a suicidal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear, personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""wanting to,"" ""feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - The post explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide."" This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and desire to not be alive, without a plan, method, or preparation.

392,"""friend"" snitched on me and told family my plan to kill myself. now they're keeping their heads up and watching me. this is like preventing someone to get euthanized. what the fuck.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself."" It also compares the situation to ""preventing someone to get euthanized,"" which implies a desire for death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""what the fuck"" indicates strong frustration, anger, and possibly despair about being prevented from carrying out the plan.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""my plan to kill myself"" directly indicates the existence of a plan. While the details of the plan are not provided, the *mention* of a plan is key.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are described. The focus is on a current plan that has been revealed and is now being thwarted.
    *   **Imminence:** The family ""watching me"" suggests a perceived current risk by others, implying the plan was considered imminent or serious.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer's frustration about being prevented and the comparison to euthanasia strongly suggest a genuine desire to die and carry out the plan.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""my plan to kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the frustration at being prevented from executing the plan and the comparison to euthanasia clearly indicate a desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite; the writer is upset that their plan is being interfered with.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" The post directly meets this criterion.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The existence of a ""plan"" implies some level of preparation or detailed thought, even if not explicitly described in the post.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current situation where a ""plan"" (likely a future intention) has been revealed, and the family is now preventing it.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes a ""plan"" that was revealed, not an action that was initiated.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is clear, explicit suicidal intent and a plan.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because a ""plan"" is explicitly mentioned. Ideation is defined as *without* any specific plan, method, or preparations.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post contains an ""explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to die"" (frustration about being prevented, desire for euthanasia-like outcome) AND ""also mentions... a plan to commit suicide"" (""my plan to kill myself"").
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no concrete, initiated, potentially lethal action is described as having occurred. It's about a revealed plan, not a past attempt.

Based on the explicit mention of ""my plan to kill myself"" and the clear desire to act on it (expressed through frustration), the post clearly falls under 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""im gonna kill myself"" - This is an explicit statement of suicidal intent.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I hope my baby ends up safe"" - This indicates concern for a loved one in the context of their own impending death, suggesting a farewell or final thought.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children"" - This describes a clear period of withdrawal and isolation, which is a form of preparation. ""then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now."" - This provides a specific timeline for the intended act. While a *specific method* (e.g., pills, gun) is not mentioned, the detailed preparation (withdrawal) and the specific timeline for the act itself constitute a plan.
    *   References to past actions: None.
    *   Imminence: ""3 weeks from now"" - A specific future date for the act.
    *   Asses the writer's stated desire: There is a clear and direct wish to die and carry out the act.

    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No explicit method (like ""pills"" or ""gun"") is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. The plan to ""minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks"" and ""won't reach out or foster conversations"" is a clear preparation/withdrawal. The specific timeline (""3 weeks from now"") for the act is also part of the plan. The phrase ""I hope my baby ends up safe"" can be interpreted as a final thought or preparation for leaving.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""3 weeks from now"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes a future plan, not a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, explicit, personal desire to die and commit suicide.
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond just thoughts or a desire to die; it includes specific preparations (withdrawal from others) and a clear timeline for the act. This constitutes a plan.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no action has been initiated; the post describes a future plan.
    *   It fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""im gonna kill myself"") AND also mentions preparations being taken (""minimally interact... for 3 weeks,"" ""won't reach out"") and a specific timeline for the act (""3 weeks from now"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""Would this kill me"" directly references death as a desired outcome.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The intent behind the question implies despair or a wish to end life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** Yes. The post lists specific substances and quantities: ""Midol 3 bottles,"" ""Prozac 30 20mg pills,"" ""Tylenol bottle,"" ""Water bottle full of alcohol."" This constitutes a detailed method for an overdose.
    *   **References to past actions:** No.
    *   **Imminence:** The question is posed in the present tense, implying a current consideration of action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The question ""Would this kill me"" in the context of listing specific lethal means strongly indicates a desire for death by using those means. It's not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a direct inquiry about the lethality of a specific plan.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Not explicitly ""kill myself,"" but ""Would this kill me"" in this context is a clear expression of intent to use the listed items to achieve death.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the inquiry about the lethality of a specific combination of substances strongly implies a desire for a lethal outcome.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; the post is inquiring about the effectiveness of a potential action.

    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes. The method is overdose. The specific substances are Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, and alcohol, with quantities. This is a clear and detailed method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The listing of specific items and quantities suggests they are either gathered or being considered for immediate use as part of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention, seeking information about the lethality of a hypothetical action.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's a question about a potential future action, not a description of an action already taken.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (implied by the question about lethality) and, critically, provides a specific plan/method (listing specific substances and quantities for an overdose).
    *   It goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') and beyond just expressing a desire to die without a plan ('Ideation').
    *   It does not describe an initiated past action ('Attempt').
    *   Therefore, the presence of both suicidal intent and a specific method/plan places it squarely in the 'Behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end it"", ""suicide"", ""doing it in a way that doesn't looks like suicide"".
    - Emotional indicators: The user expresses a desire to ""get what I want"" by ending their life, and is concerned about the impact on loved ones, leading to thoughts of disguising it. This indicates a clear desire to die.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Like a car accident or something."" This is a specific method being considered as part of a plan. The phrase ""How I'm planning to end it"" explicitly states planning.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""recently I've been thinking of doing it"". This indicates ongoing, current consideration of a plan.
    - Assessed desire: There is a genuine wish to die (""I'll get what I want without fucking up anyone's mental health"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide,"" ""end it.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""How I'm planning to end it,"" ""I'll get what I want.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present and being planned for.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""Like a car accident or something."" This is a specific method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The post explicitly states ""How I'm planning to end it,"" indicating a planning phase, and mentions a specific method as part of that plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention and planning (""How I'm planning to end it,"" ""recently I've been thinking of doing it"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes planning for a future action, not an initiated past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (""How I'm planning to end it,"" ""I'll get what I want""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post also mentions a specific method (""Like a car accident or something"") as part of the stated ""planning."" This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' into 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past, initiated, potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of both suicidal intent and a specific method/plan clearly fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

My family are giving up on me my dad hardly talks to me and I'm a constant burden on my sister and I'll never be able to help my mum in anyway. Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in. What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family. Hell I booked driving lesson but me being mentally dumb picked an expensive instructor and all it did was make my sister more stressed than she already was. She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""complete lost cause,"" ""constantly stuck,"" ""never had any skills that are useful,"" ""family are giving up on me,"" ""constant burden,"" ""failed miserably,"" ""big fuck up,"" ""mentally dumb,"" ""always going to fail everything."" These show extreme hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and feelings of being a burden.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: None related to suicide. The ""any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably"" refers to attempts to improve their life situation (e.g., job applications), not suicidal actions.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not applicable as no suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses profound self-loathing, despair, and a belief that they are a failure and a burden. There is no explicit statement of a desire to die or not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on the writer's perceived failures and their negative impact on their family, leading to intense feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, but not a direct wish for death.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. This is consistent with the analysis.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past failures and current feelings of despair and being a burden.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly indicates significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden and a failure. These are strong risk factors for suicide.
    - However, there is no explicit mention of suicidal intent, a desire to die, or any plan, method, or past attempt related to suicide.
    - The content aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness... but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.""
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (no explicit desire to die), 'Behavior' (no plan/method), or 'Attempt' (no past initiated lethal action).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I feel like shit,"" ""depressed,"" ""fucking sad,"" ""feel a little less alone."" These indicate general distress, sadness, and loneliness.

    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The user expresses a current need for connection (""right now"") to cope with their feelings. There is no stated imminent suicidal intention.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer's stated desire is to ""vent about it or just talk to someone about random basic things to feel a little less alone and depressed."" This is a desire for connection and emotional support to alleviate distress, not a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a desire to feel *less* alone and depressed, implying a desire to cope and feel better, not to cease existing.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of distress and a current intention to seek support.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, and loneliness.
    - There is no explicit personal expression of a desire to die or suicidal intent. The user is seeking connection as a coping mechanism for their feelings.
    - There is no mention of any plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
    - There is no description of a past suicidal attempt.
    - Based on the definitions, 'Ideation' requires explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive. This is absent. 'Behavior' requires a plan/method. 'Attempt' requires a past initiated action.
    - The post fits the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness... but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" The user is sad and seeking help to feel better, which is a sign of distress but not a direct suicidal statement.

Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of.

    - References to past actions: ""reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to... Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital."" This describes a crisis intervention, not necessarily a self-initiated lethal action.
    - Imminence: ""lately it feels like I just can't continue,"" ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this.""
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to die or not be alive, expressed through phrases like ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this"" and ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly and strongly through phrases like ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""lately it feels like I just can't continue,"" and losing fear of ""non existence after death."" This indicates a personal desire to end their life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they are losing their deterrents.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? YES. ""I wrote a note today."" Writing a note is a direct preparation for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past struggles, a recent crisis (ER/hospital visit), and current/future intentions (""I don't know what to do anymore,"" ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The ER visit was a result of reaching out or being taken, not a description of a self-initiated lethal action. The ""note"" is a preparation, not an initiated lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die or not continue living, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly mentions a preparation for suicide: ""I wrote a note today."" This element moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' into 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a completed or initiated potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'. The ER visit was a consequence of distress/seeking help, not an attempt itself.
    - Therefore, the combination of strong suicidal ideation and a concrete preparation (""wrote a note"") fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end my life"" is a clear and direct phrase for suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: Implied distress, persistence in trying, and failure.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" This explicitly refers to past, initiated actions.
    - Imminence: The actions are described as past (""Tried,"" ""didn't work"").
    - Writer's stated desire: The desire to die is clearly implied by the repeated attempts to ""end my life.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""end my life"" is a direct phrase.
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die by stating they ""tried to end my life.""
    - The writer does not negate these thoughts; they describe acting on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes past events: ""Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" The use of ""tried"" and ""didn't work"" indicates completed actions in the past.
    - Crucially, it describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past and failed. The phrase ""Tried to end my life"" signifies a concrete, self-initiated action, and ""didn't work"" confirms it was an attempt that failed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly describes a past, self-initiated action (""Tried to end my life"") that was intended to be lethal but failed (""Didn't work""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Attempt', which focuses on ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much."" This indicates significant distress, frustration, and hopelessness related to a chronic medical issue, not explicitly suicidal feelings.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: None related to self-harm or suicide. The post details a past injury and subsequent medical journey.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No suicidal intentions are stated. The ""don't know what to do anymore"" refers to his medical situation.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is no stated desire to die. The despair is clearly linked to the ongoing, unresolved physical symptoms and the lack of effective treatment.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The hopelessness is tied to the medical condition, not a wish to end life.

    - There is no mention of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, or past attempts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I deserve to die,"" ""I just deserve to be dead,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot."" Specific methods mentioned: ""bullet in my head,"" ""slit my fucking throat,"" ""stomp me out.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme self-loathing (""self-absorbed whiny piece of shit,"" ""flaming turd,"" ""fucking monster,"" ""I suck""), hopelessness (""there is no better, this is it""), feeling like a burden, despair, anhedonia (doesn't want to take initiative, doesn't want to get better).
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** The post *explicitly states* ""I have no plans."" While specific methods of death are mentioned (""bullet,"" ""slit throat""), they are framed as things the author *deserves* or *wishes someone else would do to them*, not as their own active plan to carry out. For example, ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat"" is a desire for someone else to act, not a plan by the author.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** No specific timeline mentioned.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Very strong and explicit desire to die and not be alive. The initial ""I have no plans"" is about *their own initiation* of a plan, but the desire for death is paramount and expressed through specific violent means they wish upon themselves.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases, but it uses very direct and strong expressions of a desire for death: ""I deserve to die,"" ""I just deserve to be dead,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""I wish someone would... slit my fucking throat.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, unequivocally.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire for death is clearly expressed as a personal feeling and a deserved outcome.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""bullet in my head"" and ""slit my fucking throat"" are specific methods.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, the author states ""I have no plans."" The methods mentioned are framed as things they *deserve* or *wish would happen to them by others*, not as a plan they intend to execute themselves. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" While methods are mentioned, the *plan* is explicitly negated, and the methods are presented passively (deserving it, wishing someone else would do it). This is a strong desire for death with specific methods in mind, but without the author's own active plan or preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current desire/intention.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post goes far beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. It expresses a clear, personal, and strong desire to die (""I deserve to die,"" ""I just deserve to be dead""). This fits 'Ideation'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** This is the most critical distinction here. While specific methods of death are mentioned (""bullet in my head,"" ""slit my fucking throat""), the author explicitly states ""I have no plans."" Furthermore, phrases like ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat"" indicate a passive desire for death by a specific method, rather than an active plan by the author. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a *plan* or *preparations*. The methods are present as desired outcomes, but the author's own active planning is explicitly negated. Given the explicit negation of plans and the passive framing of the methods (wishing someone else would do it), it leans towards 'Ideation'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'"" applies here because the author's statement ""I have no plans"" creates that uncertainty regarding *their own* active planning.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No past initiated action is described.

Based on the strong, explicit desire to die, coupled with the explicit statement ""I have no plans"" and the passive framing of the mentioned methods (deserving it, wishing someone else would do it), the post best fits 'Ideation'.

And who wants to be with a sad man? Noone. So that's my company, forever. Noone. I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""I will die alone,"" ""My parents don't deserve to bury their child,"" ""the second they're gone, so am I."" The last phrase strongly implies self-inflicted death.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I will die alone,"" ""what's the fucking point?""), despair (""just a fucking sad man,"" ""sick of this emptiness""), self-loathing (""hideous fucking mutant,"" ""fat retard"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    - Imminence: The intent ""the second they're gone, so am I"" is conditional and not immediate.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, conditional desire to die (""so am I"" after parents are gone) and profound existential despair.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""the second they're gone, so am I"" is a clear, personal statement of future intent to end their life, conditional on their parents' death. This goes beyond mere abstract thoughts or general distress. It's a personal decision for the future.
    - Does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the future intent is stated as a given.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there's a clear desire to die (conditional future intent) but no plan/method/preparation, this points to 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""the second they're gone, so am I"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses profound despair, hopelessness, and a conditional future intent to die by suicide (""the second they're gone, so am I""). This is a personal expression of suicidal intent.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings or a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or preparations. It is more than 'Indicator' because of the clear, personal, although conditional, intent to die. It is not 'Behavior' because no plan/method is present. It is not 'Attempt' because no past action is described.

I don't know what I want anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: Yes, ""suicidal ones,"" ""thinking of killing myself,"" ""aftermath of suicide,"" and explicitly ""I have a plan"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""bad urges,"" ""don't know what to do,"" ""guilty downward spiral,"" ""hate myself,"" ""crying,"" ""don't know what I want anymore."" These indicate significant distress, guilt, and internal conflict.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" While no *details* of the plan are given, the *existence* of a plan is directly stated.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal *actions* are mentioned, only past occurrence of urges (""they've been happening again for a while now"").
    - Imminence: ""tonight"" for the urges, and the plan is described as current (""I have a plan"").
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses ""bad urges tonight"" and ""thinking of killing myself."" There's also significant distress about the impact on others (""hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them and my sibling""), indicating internal conflict, but the underlying suicidal thoughts and the existence of a plan are clearly present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal ones,"" ""thinking of killing myself,"" ""suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, through the mention of ""bad urges,"" ""thinking of killing myself,"" and the general despair, even with the internal conflict.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer expresses guilt and concern about the impact on others, which shows a desire *not* to cause harm to others, but it does not negate the presence of the suicidal thoughts or the plan for themselves. The thoughts and urges are acknowledged as personal and current.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method, tool, or location is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations (like writing a note or acquiring means) are detailed.
    - However, the post explicitly states: ""like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" This direct admission of having a ""plan"" is a key element for the 'Behavior' category, even without specific details of the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current urges and thoughts (""tonight,"" ""these days"") and a current plan (""I have a plan"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide, as it includes explicit personal expressions of ""suicidal urges"" and ""thinking of killing myself."" This moves it past 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly states ""like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" This direct admission of a plan, even without specific details, is the defining factor that moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit mention of having a ""plan,"" the classification is 'Behavior'.

404,"The questionnaires that include a question asking if I've had suicidal thoughts actually make me less likely to talk about. Because I know it'll cause a massive issue and result in a lot of stress. There going to ask me too many details, and be too insistent with their questioning. I find therapy tough enough as it is, and if lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff, then that's great. Well it's great till it starts to happen more and more frequently. I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts"" and that these thoughts are happening ""more and more frequently."" It also uses the metaphor ""this grave I dug myself,"" suggesting a feeling of being trapped in a dire situation.
    - Emotional indicators: ""less likely to talk about,"" ""massive issue,"" ""lot of stress,"" ""tough enough,"" ""not sure if I'm strong enough."" These indicate significant distress, avoidance, and a feeling of being overwhelmed or lacking strength.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" in the context of past questionnaires and therapy, implying they have been present. The phrase ""starts to happen more and more frequently"" indicates an ongoing and escalating presence of these thoughts. No past *actions* are described, only thoughts.
    - Imminence: No specific imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer acknowledges having ""suicidal thoughts"" and that they are increasing in frequency. The phrase ""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" implies a personal struggle with a potentially life-threatening internal state, rather than merely observing unwanted thoughts. While there's no explicit ""I want to die,"" the direct admission of suicidal thoughts and the feeling of being trapped in a ""grave"" signifies a personal experience of ideation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Not explicitly ""I want to die."" However, the increasing frequency of ""suicidal thoughts"" and the metaphor of being in a ""grave"" from which they are ""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out"" strongly imply a personal, distressing experience of suicidal ideation. The writer is not negating these thoughts or stating they are unwanted in the sense of not being personally felt; rather, they are expressing difficulty in discussing them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current and increasing frequency of ""suicidal thoughts"" and a current feeling of being trapped.
    - Crucially, does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly states the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" and that they are occurring ""more and more frequently."" This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide. The struggle described (""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave"") indicates a personal experience of these thoughts. Therefore, it fits 'Ideation' more than 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The core of the post is the personal experience and increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts, aligning perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""nearly killing myself"": This refers to a past event where the author came very close to committing suicide, implying an initiated action or being on the verge of one.
        *   ""shooting up the school"": This is a violent threat towards others, not self-harm or suicide.
        *   ""I fucking hate living"": Expresses a strong desire to not be alive, current despair.
        *   ""rotting away"": Emotional indicator of hopelessness and despair.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hatred, despair, feeling stuck, feeling like rotting away, questioning self-worth.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned for a *current* intention.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""nearly killing myself"" is a direct reference to a past, very close-to-lethal action.
    *   **Imminence:** No current imminence stated for a new action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I fucking hate living"" clearly indicates a current desire to not be alive.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""nearly killing myself"" is explicit, albeit past. ""I fucking hate living"" expresses a clear desire to not be alive.
    *   The writer does not negate these thoughts; they express current despair.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a *current* suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a past event (""nearly killing myself"") and current distress/ideation (""I fucking hate living,"" ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"").
    *   The crucial part is ""nearly killing myself."" This phrase implies a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated or came to the very brink of initiation in the past. It goes beyond mere ideation or planning; it suggests a concrete step was taken or almost taken. This aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' which focuses on *initiated actions*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The phrase ""I fucking hate living"" indicates current **Ideation**.
    *   However, the phrase ""nearly killing myself"" describes a past, concrete action (or very close to it) that was potentially lethal. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" ""Nearly killing myself"" fits this description, implying the author went beyond just thinking or planning and was at the point of action.
    *   Since the post describes a past attempt (or near-attempt) and also current ideation, the rule states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The past action is clearly described as ""nearly killing myself,"" which implies a concrete, potentially lethal action was initiated or very nearly initiated.

    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The post describes a past event, not a current or future intention.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: ""I wanted to [die]"". This confirms a desire to die at the time of the described action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill yourself"", and ""I wanted to [die]"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wanted to [die]"" in the context of the overdose.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire was present and acted upon.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""120+ pills of ibuprofen"" and ""hard liquor from the bottle.""
    - Are there signs of preparation? The act of ""swallowed 120+ pills"" and ""drank hard liquor"" describes the *initiation* of the act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:

    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle."" This was an initiated, potentially lethal action. The phrase ""Survived OD"" confirms it was an overdose attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle"") with the clear intent to die (""I wanted to""). This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt' as it describes a ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death"". The phrase ""Survived OD"" is a clear indicator of an attempted overdose.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Suicide has become my quick solution."" and ""find a way to get away from it all.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""totally helpless,"" ""misunderstood,"" ""paranoid delusions,"" ""world is just so rotten to me,"" ""sick of every worthless person,"" ""All words are meaningless. Every action is malicious.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""I've told two people about my feelings..."" (refers to past disclosure of feelings, not suicidal actions).
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to ""get away from it all"" and suicide is presented as the ""quick solution,"" indicating a personal desire to end their current state.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""Suicide has become my quick solution.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all"" and stating suicide is their ""quick solution"" clearly expresses a desire to end their existence.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is implied; suicide is presented as a desired solution.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current perception of suicide as a solution (""Suicide has become my quick solution"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress and unwanted thoughts (Indicator) because it explicitly states ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" and ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all,"" indicating a clear personal desire for suicide.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan or method.

It slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away. I wonder if a long-term cure even exists.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No direct mentions. The phrase ""death stranding"" is a reference to a video game, not a direct suicidal statement.
    - Emotional indicators: ""hard to keep going,"" ""Every day feels like the previous one,"" ""badly mangled (psychically),"" ""slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away,"" ""wonder if a long-term cure even exists."" These indicate severe depression, hopelessness, and chronic suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: None.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer expresses the difficulty of living with depression and the feeling that it never goes away, questioning if a cure exists. There is no explicit statement of a desire to die or suicidal intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. While it expresses that it's ""hard to keep going"" and the suffering is severe, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or end life. It describes the *experience* of depression.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.
    - Leans towards 'Indicator' because there is no explicit personal desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Describes a current, ongoing state of depression.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly describes general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and the chronic nature of depression.
    - It lacks any clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The phrase ""hard to keep going"" expresses difficulty in living, but not a direct wish to end life.
    - There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations.
    - There are no descriptions of past initiated suicidal actions.
    - Based on the definitions, the post fits ""Indicator"" as it expresses general distress and hopelessness without explicit suicidal intent.

I keep saying to myself I'll see a doctor but deep down I know that's not true.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/suicide: Yes, ""dad's cause of death and it was suicide,"" ""finding out he committed suicide just makes it seem like it's inevitable for me,"" ""I get suicidal thoughts.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""felt like shit for years,"" ""reliving the same day everyday,"" ""takes so much energy."" (Hopelessness, despair, anhedonia).
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" in the past/present, but no past *actions* or attempts.
    - Imminence: Not immediate. The phrase ""im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" suggests a lack of immediate intent to act.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer states ""I get suicidal thoughts,"" which is a personal expression. However, this is immediately followed by ""but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it,"" which indicates a significant lack of current intent or desire to act on those thoughts. The primary sentiment is distress about the thoughts and feelings of inevitability, rather than a clear, unmitigated desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I get suicidal thoughts.""
    - Clear desire to die or not be alive? This is ambiguous. While ""I get suicidal thoughts"" is present, the subsequent ""but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" strongly negates a current, active desire or intent to act on those thoughts. The post describes the *experience* of having suicidal thoughts and feelings of inevitability, rather than a direct statement of wanting to die *now*.
    - Writer explicitly states they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The ""pussy"" comment implies a lack of desire to act on them, even if the thoughts are present. This leans towards the 'Indicator' definition's nuance regarding unwanted thoughts or lack of personal desire to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Describes current feelings and thoughts (""I get suicidal thoughts,"" ""I'm reliving the same day everyday"").
    - No specific, potentially lethal action was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains ""suicidal thoughts"" which might initially suggest 'Ideation'. However, the critical phrase ""but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" significantly mitigates the direct suicidal intent or desire to act. This phrase indicates a lack of current personal desire to carry out the thoughts, despite their presence. The post is more about the distress of having these thoughts and feelings of inevitability due to family history.
    - According to the definitions:
        - 'Ideation' requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" While thoughts are present, the negation of action (""too much of a pussy"") weakens the ""desire to not be alive"" or current intent to act.
        - 'Indicator' states: ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die."" The ""too much of a pussy to ever do it"" implies a lack of current personal desire to act on the thoughts, fitting this nuance.
    - Given the strong mitigating statement, the post aligns better with 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and the *presence* of suicidal thoughts, but explicitly lacks a clear, current, personal *intent* or *desire* to act on them. The rule ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator"" also applies here due to the ambiguity introduced by the mitigating phrase.
    - No plan/method/preparation, so not 'Behavior'.
    - No past initiated action, so not 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i wanna off myself,"" ""if i killed myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""can't see it getting better at fucking all,"" ""fucking hate it here,"" ""fucking shit i feel."" There is also a stated desire to ""hang onto that string of hope"" and a fear of getting better, indicating significant internal conflict and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions initiated.
    - Imminence: No specific time frame mentioned.
    - Writer's stated desire: Explicitly states ""i wanna off myself."" While there's internal conflict and fear, the desire is clearly articulated.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""i wanna off myself,"" ""if i killed myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i wanna off myself.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, they state they *want* to, despite being scared and conflicted.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current intention/desire.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent (""i wanna off myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear personal desire to die without detailing a plan, method, or preparation. The internal conflict and fear do not negate the explicit suicidal desire.

411,"suicidal thoughts. HI i'm a 15 year old girl and all my entire life i have been dreaming of becoming a high fashion model when i grow up but there's a problem only tall people can walk the ramp short people are not allowed. Ik that i can be a commercial model if i want to because there is no height requirements but i really2 want to be a high fashion one because that's what i've always wanted ,my whole entire life. If i don't choose the carreer that i want i know that i will never be happy with my life. I haven't grow since last year and to make it worse im only 4'11 feet and the height requirements for runway models are 5'7 to 5'8 or 9. I feel so hopeless with myself that's why i want to give up my life and just die. And that's not the only reason, all my friends are getting taller then me and i am losing my self esteem very fast. I REALLY WANT TO DIE but i can't leave my parents too,im their only child and if they lose me i don't even want to know what will happen to them. I FEEL TRAPED. THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR ME. IF I LIVE I KNOW I WLL NEVER BE HAPPY WITH MYSELF AND IF I DIE I KNOW MY PARENTS WOULD BE DEVASTATED. I hate myself, i really hate myself. i'm so hopeless and such an idiot, why did i want to choose such a career where i know there is no future for me. As i'm writing this my mind is becoming more worse and the suicidal thoughts are like eating me up. There is no one that i can share my problems with.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"" (multiple times), ""want to give up my life and just die"", ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"", ""if I die"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""hopeless"", ""losing my self esteem"", ""I feel so hopeless with myself"", ""I hate myself, i really hate myself"", ""I FEEL TRAPED"", ""THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR ME"", ""never be happy"".
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, gun), location (e.g., bridge), or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
    - References to past actions: No past actions, initiated or completed, are mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""As i'm writing this my mind is becoming more worse and the suicidal thoughts are like eating me up."" This indicates current, active thoughts, but no immediate plan.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer clearly states ""I want to give up my life and just die"" and ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"". This is a genuine desire to die, although there is also conflict about leaving parents.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and direct phrases like ""want to give up my life and just die"" and ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"".
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive.
    - While the writer expresses distress about the thoughts (""eating me up"") and conflict about parents, the core desire to die is explicitly stated as personal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - Since there is a desire to die but no clear indication of a plan, method, or preparation, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current feelings and future intentions (""I want to give up..."", ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"").
    - It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""I want to give up my life and just die"", ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts; there is clear personal suicidal intent.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation to carry out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without a specific plan, method, or preparations.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""cutting my self for a long time"" - self-harm, ongoing.
        *   ""For the past month I've been contemplating suicide."" - explicit suicidal ideation.
        *   ""if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" - explicit mention of suicide and a joint plan.
        *   ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it."" - clear statement of suicidal intent.
        *   (Note: The mention of the other girl's ""failed attempt to commit suicide"" is about someone else, not the author.)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""numb,"" ""don't get any joy out of life,"" ""fucking lost,"" ""didn't want to live before I met her."" - Strong indicators of despair, anhedonia, hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" - This constitutes a joint plan for suicide. While a specific method isn't detailed, the agreement to act together is a concrete planning element.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""cutting my self for a long time"" - This is self-harm, not described as an attempt to die.
    *   **Imminence:** The intent ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it"" is conditional but strong and implies immediate action if the condition is met.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it."" - A clear, personal desire to die under a specific circumstance.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""contemplating suicide,"" ""kill her self"" (in the context of a joint plan), and ""I'm ending it.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I didn't want to live before I met her,"" ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it."").
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they express a clear desire to act on them under a condition.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a plan is mentioned: ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together."" This is a clear agreement to commit suicide jointly, which falls under the definition of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current contemplation (""For the past month I've been contemplating suicide"") and future intention/plan (""we will do it together,"" ""I'm ending it"").
    *   The post *does not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the *author* in the past or very recently. The self-harm is described as a coping mechanism for pain, not a suicide attempt, and the attempt mentioned was by the other girl.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and desire to die (""Ideation"" criteria met).
    *   Crucially, it also includes a specific plan: ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together."" This joint agreement to commit suicide is a concrete planning element, moving it beyond mere ideation into ""Behavior.""
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal act by the author, so it is not ""Attempt.""

Based on the explicit personal desire to die and the mention of a specific plan (the joint agreement), the most appropriate category is Behavior.

    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated action* that was potentially lethal. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and desire without a concrete plan or past action.

The problem is not your dad or his girlfriend by any matters. The problem is YOU. If you disappeared, I assure you that your dad would be happier, and don't start with your depression bullshit, that I got tired of that"" -My mom. ""I'M TALKING TO YOU! ANSWER! You know what? Just shoot yourself already"" -mom. ""You know I always invite you with my girlfriend? But you never want to come. I'm not leaving you alone; you are leaving yourself alone. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM"" -Dad. ""What? Did you try to kill yourself again? So be it, You are too coward to actually do it, anyway"" -Dad. ""Did you vomit your food again? I'm tired of this shit. You are wasting MY MONEY. You know what? I won't buy you food anymore because you vomit it anyways. That valuable money could serve other purpose and don't you dare tell your mother about this because you are the one that started this problem"" -Dad. ""I just had a lot of fun with my girlfriend and her daughters. Oh! You were there? I didn't even notice you"" -Dad. ""What? Had a bad day at school? Are you going to try to kill yourself again? Hahahaha"" -Dad. ""Why are you crying? Are you going to cut your wrists again? Stop it with this shit. You are just doing it for attention"" -Dad. ""My girlfriend is going to visit.

Dad: When I had a daughter, I didn't know it was going to be as disappointing as you. ""All the family knows about you. They are al disappointed"" -mom. &amp;#x200B;. To be continued.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The parents' quotes contain ""kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself,"" ""disappeared,"" ""try to kill yourself again,"" and ""cut your wrists again."" These are direct references to suicidal acts and self-harm, and critically, they refer to the *user's* past actions (""again"").
    - Emotional indicators: The user is clearly experiencing severe distress, feeling unwanted, and dealing with abusive parents. The parents explicitly mention the user's ""depression.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No current plan, method, or preparation is stated *by the user* in this post. The methods (gun, cutting wrists) are mentioned by the parents in reference to the user's past actions or as suggestions.
    - References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed: This is a key element. The father's repeated questions, ""What? Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"", directly imply that the user *has* initiated suicidal actions in the past. Similarly, ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" implies past self-harm. The user presents these quotes without refuting them, which, in the context of the post, indicates these are indeed past actions.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No current or imminent intention is stated by the user.
    - Writer's stated desire: The user's only direct statement is ""Dad, If you are treating me like this, why did you want to have a daughter in the first place,"" which expresses profound distress and feeling unwanted, but not an explicit current desire to die. However, the post as a whole, through the parents' quotes, heavily implies a history of suicidal behavior from the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? (Yes/No) - Yes, but these are in the parents' quotes, referring to the user's past actions or as suggestions to the user. The user themselves does not explicitly state current intent to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Not explicitly from the user's own words in the present moment.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? - No.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? - Methods like ""gun"" and ""cut your wrists"" are mentioned, but only in the context of the parents referring to the user's past actions or suggesting them. No *current* plan or method *by the user* is stated.
    - Are there signs of preparation? - No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? - It describes past events (the parents' quotes) that directly refer to the user's past suicidal actions and self-harm.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? - Yes. The phrases ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"" are direct references to past, initiated suicidal actions by the user. ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" also refers to past self-harm, which can be a suicidal behavior. The post clearly indicates that the user has a history of initiating potentially lethal actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The core of this post, regarding suicide risk, lies in the repeated and explicit references to the user's *past attempts* and self-harm, as conveyed through the parents' quotes. The definition of 'Attempt' specifically covers ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The father's questions (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"") directly describe such past actions. While the user doesn't state current ideation or a plan, the clear description of past attempts within the post makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate category.

415,What's the least painful way to kill yourself?. I know I shouldn't be asking this but I just need a way to Kim's. I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit someone just give me a straight up answer.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill yourself"", ""Kim's"" (likely a typo for ""kill myself"").
    *   Emotional indicators: Desperation (""I just need a way""), clear rejection of help/intervention (""I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post is *asking for* a specific method (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?"", ""just need a way to Kim's"", ""someone just give me a straight up answer""). This is an active search for a plan/method.
    *   References to past actions: None.
    *   Imminence: The urgency (""just need a way"", ""straight up answer"") suggests current intent.
    *   Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to ""kill myself"" (implied by the question and context).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill yourself"" and implied ""kill myself"".
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, by actively seeking a method to do so.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite. They are actively seeking a method.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? The user is *soliciting* a specific method. While they haven't *stated* their own method, the act of asking ""What's the least painful way?"" and ""just need a way"" is a direct step towards identifying or acquiring a plan/method. This goes beyond mere ideation into active planning or seeking the means for a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and a desire to act.
    *   It's not merely 'Ideation' because the user is not just expressing thoughts or a desire to die; they are actively seeking information on *how* to die (""What's the least painful way?"", ""just need a way"", ""give me a straight up answer""). This active search for a method constitutes a step towards planning. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" While the user isn't *stating* their own plan, they are *soliciting* a plan/method, which is a strong behavioral indicator of moving towards execution.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' as no past initiated action is described.

    The active solicitation of a method pushes this beyond 'Ideation' into 'Behavior' because it signifies a concrete step in the planning process, even if the plan itself isn't fully formed or stated by the user.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal note"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside"" indicates severe internal distress and suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""write a suicidal note"" is a direct preparation for a suicidal act. The word ""again"" suggests this is a recurring thought or action.
    - References to past actions: ""again"" refers to a past instance of writing a suicidal note, which is a past preparation.
    - Imminence: ""I think I'm going to write"" indicates a current intention to act soon.
    - Writer's stated desire: The intention to write a suicidal note strongly implies a desire to die or end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not directly, but ""suicidal note"" clearly links to suicide.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The act of writing a ""suicidal note"" is a preparatory act for suicide, which inherently implies a desire to die or end one's life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again"" suggests an intention to proceed, not to resist.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method (like pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""writing a suicidal note"" is a clear and direct sign of preparation for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? ""I think I'm going to write"" indicates a current intention to act in the future. ""again"" refers to a past instance of this preparation.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, writing a note is a *preparation*, not an *initiated lethal action* itself. It's a step *before* an attempt. The ""again"" refers to the *preparation* (writing the note), not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to the clear mention of ""suicidal note"" and the intention to write it.
    - It includes a specific preparation (""write a suicidal note""), which moves it beyond mere thoughts or desire (Ideation) into the 'Behavior' category.
    - It does not describe a past initiated, potentially lethal action (Attempt). Writing a note, while serious, is a preparatory step, not the act of attempting suicide itself.

Based on the explicit mention of a preparation (""write a suicidal note""), the classification is Behavior.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""slaying myself"" is a direct, albeit metaphorical, reference to killing oneself. The alternative mentioned, ""committing a massacre,"" is about harming others, but the focus for classification is on the self-harm aspect.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post doesn't explicitly state emotions like hopelessness or despair, but the contemplation of such extreme acts (massacre or self-slaying) strongly implies severe distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., how they would ""slay"" themselves), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I will end up"" suggests a future possibility or prediction, not immediate imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""or maybe just slaying myself"" indicates a personal contemplation or consideration of self-harm/suicide as a potential outcome for the writer. It's presented as an alternative to harming others, but it's still a personal thought about ending their own life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""slaying myself"" is a clear, direct personal expression of suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""slaying myself"" expresses a consideration of ending one's own life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer presents it as a potential outcome without negation.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""Slaying myself"" does not specify how.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future possibility/intention (""I will end up"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it's a contemplation of a future action, not an initiated one.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""slaying myself""). This rules out 'Indicator' which requires a lack of clear personal intent or explicit negation of desire to act.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., how they would ""slay"" themselves). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes an explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings/desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

418,"I wish I had friends. I wish I had friends so badly. I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation.""
    - Emotional indicators: Laziness, shame, feeling stupid, overwhelmed, intimidated, dissatisfaction with life, inability to act on dreams, feeling outclassed.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post is about a lack of willpower and a desire to overcome it, not a plan for suicide.
    - References to past actions: Failed classes, good test scores, daydreaming, not attending a protest. No past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: No immediate intent stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: Crucially, the author states: ""As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" This is a clear negation of a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal ideation.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The author explicitly states, ""I don't want to die— I want to live.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, the author states they ""don't want to die"" and ""want to live,"" indicating the suicidal ideation is unwanted or not representative of their true desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and past struggles. No current or future suicidal intention.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post mentions ""suicidal ideation,"" but the author explicitly states, ""I don't want to die— I want to live."" This is a direct negation of a personal desire to die.
    - According to the definitions:
        - 'Ideation' requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" The stated desire is the opposite.
        - 'Indicator' states: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" This perfectly matches the author's statement that they ""don't want to die"" even though they have ""suicidal ideation."" The ideation is presented as a symptom of shame, not a genuine wish.
    - There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no past initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the 'Indicator' category because the author explicitly negates a desire to die, framing the suicidal ideation as something unwanted or a symptom of distress rather than a personal intent.

But at the same time I'm hesitant because what if I don't die, but instead get permanently disabled and have to sit in a wheelchair for the rest of my life?.

I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods: ""shoot myself in the head,"" ""don't die."" Specific method: ""my dad's handgun.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hesitation, fear of disability (""permanently disabled,"" ""crippled""), rejection of help (""not calling a suicide hotline"").

    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated as immediate, but the thought process is current and detailed.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a clear desire to die (""shoot myself in the head""), but is hesitant *only* due to the fear of a failed attempt leading to disability, not due to a lack of desire to die. The desire to die is present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""shoot myself in the head.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the underlying desire is to die, with the hesitation being about the *outcome of a failed attempt*.

    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, this is not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and a specific method.
    - It's not 'Ideation' because a specific method (""my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"") is explicitly mentioned. The presence of a specific method moves it to 'Behavior'.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent initiated action is described. The post describes a current thought process and consideration of a specific method, not a past action.
    - The post explicitly states a desire to die and mentions a specific method (""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head""). Even with the stated hesitancy, the plan/method is articulated.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** No explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. Phrases like ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"" are present.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""my life isn't worth living anymore,"" ""nothing I can enjoy anymore,"" ""unbearable""), despair, helplessness, anger, sadness. Anhedonia (""nothing I can enjoy anymore"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No immediate intention stated. The ""if my breathing doesn't go back to normal"" suggests a conditional despair about the future.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer states ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"" if their condition doesn't improve. This indicates a profound despair and a lack of desire to continue living under these circumstances. While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" it expresses a desire for their current life situation to end because it's unbearable.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrases ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"" strongly convey a desire for their current life to end, or a lack of desire to continue living given their suffering. This aligns with ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" from the Ideation definition.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, there is no negation; the sentiment is presented as their current reality.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and the feeling that ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living."" These are clear personal expressions of despair about the value of their own life and a desire for their current suffering to end.
    *   It does *not* contain a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does *not* describe a past initiated action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' is key. 'Indicator' is for ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent"" or for unwanted thoughts. 'Ideation' is for ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" The phrases ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"" are strong personal expressions of a desire for their current existence to cease due to suffering, fitting the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" part of the 'Ideation' definition. It's more than just general distress; it's a statement about the fundamental worth of their life.

    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., ""I'm going to use X,"" ""I have Y,"" ""I'm writing Z""). The timeframe ""this month"" indicates intent but not *how* or *with what*. This means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughs"" as something the author possesses (""my suicidal thoughs""). It also discusses the world turning into ""hell"" and being ""pessimistic"" due to suffering and mental illness.
    - Emotional indicators: ""pessimistic,"" ""suffering,"" ""mental illnesses.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No specific suicidal actions are mentioned, only the past/present existence of ""suicidal thoughs.""
    - Imminence of intentions: Not applicable, no direct intention stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer states ""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughs helped me to understood the world."" This acknowledges the presence of suicidal thoughts as a personal experience, but does not explicitly state a desire to die or to act on these thoughts in the present moment. However, the direct personal mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" is key.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughs.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Not a direct, explicit desire to die (""I want to die""). However, the personal acknowledgement of having ""suicidal thoughts"" is a strong personal expression related to suicide.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No explicit negation. The thoughts are framed as a tool for understanding the world, which is ambiguous regarding desire to act, but clearly acknowledges their presence.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes having ""suicidal thoughs"" as a past/present experience that shaped understanding. It does not describe a current or future intention to act.
    - Crucially, does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""my suicidal thoughs."" This is a personal expression of having suicidal thoughts. It goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide, making it more than an 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (in this case, ""my suicidal thoughs"") without a plan or method fits the definition of 'Ideation'. While the desire to die isn't explicitly stated, the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" is a direct personal reference to suicidal ideation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution,"" ""If I kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""hate it,"" ""nothings gonna work,"" ""sad fucked up person,"" ""done being this sad."" Indicates hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out."" This indicates a future intention to plan and a potential timeframe, but it does *not* describe a specific method, tool, location, or any concrete preparation that has already been made or decided upon. The planning is stated as something that will happen in the future (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out"").
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""on my birthday"" implies a future date, not immediate.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution,"" ""If I kill myself"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution,"" ""I wasn't cut out for life,"" ""If I kill myself"").
    - The desire is not negated or unwanted; it's presented as the ""only solution.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jump) is mentioned.
    - No specific preparations (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills"") are mentioned.
    - The phrase ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out"" indicates an *intention to plan* at a future date, not the existence of a current plan or preparations. It lacks the specificity required for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a future intention (""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday"").
    - It does not describe any past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past or very recent initiated action is described.
    - The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Behavior' requires mention of a ""plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" While the post mentions a timeframe and an *intention* to plan (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out""), it does not provide any details of a specific plan, method, or preparations that are already in place or decided upon. The definition for 'Behavior' specifies ""a specific method (e.g., 'thinking of overdosing on X pills,' 'want to jump from Y'), tools/weapons (e.g., 'have a gun,' 'getting a rope'), suitable locations (e.g., 'going to the bridge'), or preparations (e.g., 'writing my suicide note,' 'giving things away')."" None of these specific elements are present. The post expresses a strong desire to die and a future intent to plan, which aligns perfectly with 'Ideation'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'"" reinforces this choice.

    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""ending it all"" is a widely understood direct expression of suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""thinking of ending it all"" clearly conveys this.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the phrase is presented as a current consideration.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and current thoughts (""I've been thinking of ending it all"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses clear personal suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""thinking of ending it all"") coupled with intense emotional distress (hopelessness, worthlessness, burden). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparations. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the clear expression of personal suicidal thoughts/desire without a plan, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""get it over with,"" ""my death will be following very soon too."" These phrases strongly imply suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I feel kind of sorry for my mom though,"" ""I hope she learns to cope well"" indicate a sense of finality and consideration for the aftermath of their death.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" indicates a future intention to act. ""It's probably best if I get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents"" is a clear sign of preparation for death.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""this weekend,"" ""very soon too"" indicate a relatively imminent timeframe.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die (""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I want to get it over with"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly. However, the phrases ""do this once and for all,"" ""get it over with,"" and ""my death will be following very soon too"" in this context unequivocally express a personal desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, absolutely.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a clear desire to act on these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""It's probably best if I get a will in place"" is a clear and concrete preparation for death.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""attempt this weekend"") and current preparations (""get a will in place"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes future intent and current preparation, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear, current, personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The post not only expresses a desire to die and future intent (""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"") but also mentions a specific preparation (""get a will in place""). This specific preparation moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    - It does not describe a past *initiated* action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The combination of explicit suicidal intent/desire and a concrete preparatory action (getting a will in place) aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

But i really cannot live if i fail. The right time is gone, i have no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep. It's like for the first time in my life I'm almost happy, I'm almost enjoying doing stuff for my new room and I'll have more space to put all the projects i have in mind, I'm having millions thoughts of stuff i wanna do (probably just mania acting up), it's like i have a purpose or something.

I don't know how much I'll have to wait before i finally get some antidepressants but I'm feeling better nonetheless and i don't even know how I'll do it",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""I don't wanna die"" (explicitly negates desire to die), ""I really cannot live if i fail"" (conditional, but not a direct statement of suicidal intent).
    - Emotional indicators: ""almost happy,"" ""almost enjoying doing stuff,"" ""have a purpose,"" ""decent place right now,"" ""feeling better."" These are positive and indicate a shift away from despair.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: Explicitly states a *lack* of means: ""no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep."" No current plans or preparations.
    - References to past actions: ""blades i used to cut"" suggests past self-harm, but not explicitly a suicide attempt, and it's framed in the context of them being ineffective *now*.
    - Imminence: No imminence of suicidal action.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""for the first time i don't wanna die."" The overall sentiment is a shift towards wanting to live and pursue future plans, despite the conditional ""cannot live if I fail.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, it explicitly states ""I don't wanna die."" The conditional ""cannot live if I fail"" is present, but the dominant narrative is about finding reasons to live and feeling better.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""for the first time i don't wanna die.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The post highlights the *absence* of such means.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of mind (not wanting to die, feeling better) and future plans (moving, new room, projects). It mentions past self-harm (""blades i used to cut"") but not a past suicide attempt.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""I don't wanna die"" and describes feeling ""almost happy,"" ""feeling better,"" and making future plans. This directly contradicts a current desire to die or suicidal intent.
    - While there's a conditional statement (""I really cannot live if i fail""), it's not a direct expression of suicidal intent. The overall context is a positive shift in mindset.
    - There are no current suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or descriptions of past attempts.
    - The post discusses past means (meds, jumping, blades) but frames them as currently unavailable or ineffective, and within the context of *not* wanting to die.
    - This fits the 'Indicator' definition because it discusses suicide abstractly (or past considerations of it) and general distress (related to the test), but **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.** In fact, it explicitly negates it.

    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses profound despair, exhaustion, and a feeling of pointlessness (""don't know what to do anymore with my life,"" ""don't see a point in my parents for guidance""). However, there is no explicit statement of wanting to die, wanting to end their life, or any direct suicidal thought. The phrase ""taken my will to strive"" indicates a loss of motivation and purpose, but not a direct desire for death.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The post conveys extreme distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being lost and without purpose, but it does not explicitly state a desire to die or to not be alive.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses general distress, hopelessness, exhaustion, and a feeling of being directionless and trapped.
    - It *lacks* any clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Yes, explicitly states ""kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out, shoot myself with a gun, or start cutting myself"". Also states ""Its a net gain for the world if i die,"" ""I'm just waiting for the end,"" ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold.""
    - **Emotional indicators:** ""failed,"" ""failure,"" ""toxic family,"" ""depression, fear, regret and worthlessness,"" ""dumbass,"" ""lazy asshole,"" ""hate myself,"" ""sad,"" ""afraid."" High levels of despair, self-loathing, hopelessness, feeling like a burden.
    - **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** Yes, specific methods are mentioned: ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out,"" ""shoot myself with a gun."" The phrase ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"" suggests a conditional readiness to act.
    - **References to past actions:** None.
    - **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't,"" ""I'm just waiting for the end,"" ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die."" This indicates a current desire and readiness to act in the near future, with or without a specific condition being met.
    - **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, explicit wish to die and to commit suicide. The line ""I want help so badly. But im afraid."" indicates internal conflict but does not negate the expressed desire to die or the suicidal intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die,"" ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly expressed, even with accompanying fear and a wish for help.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"" (method), ""shoot myself with a gun"" (method and tool).
    - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicit preparations like ""wrote a note"" or ""got the pills,"" but the detailed methods and the contemplation of conditions (""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't"") suggest a thought process towards action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current distress and future intentions (""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses clear, personal suicidal intent (""kill myself,"" ""I want to die""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere thoughts/desire by explicitly mentioning specific methods (""slitting my wrist and bleeding out,"" ""shoot myself with a gun""). This presence of specific methods constitutes a plan, moving it beyond 'Ideation'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    - The combination of explicit suicidal intent and specific methods/plans fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No intentions stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer is expressing extreme emotional pain, confusion, and a plea for understanding and love. There is no explicit desire to die or not be alive. The phrase ""the choice is fucking obvious?"" is ambiguous but in the context of ""money or love,"" it does not imply a choice about life or death.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The primary sentiment is distress, confusion, and a desperate need for truth and love.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, self-hatred (""I hate myself,"" ""Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment.""), guilt, anxiety, feeling nothing but self-hatred since mother's death.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:**
        *   Calculated amount of isopropyl alcohol for poisoning.
        *   Tested strength of attachment points for a noose.
        *   Considered jumping in front of a car (though ruled out, it was a devised plan).
        *   Figured out how to avoid detection during the act.
        *   States ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions ""suicidal thoughts for years,"" ""contemplated and devised"" plans, ""tested"" points, ""calculated"" amounts. These are all past *planning/preparation* activities, not initiated suicidal *actions*.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide."" However, immediately followed by reasons *not* to act (""But I don't do it. I don't deserve to... I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now."").
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly states ""I wanna kill myself"" and ""I want to die."" There is a genuine wish to die, but it is currently overridden by a self-punishment motive (""I don't deserve the release of death. I must remain and suffer.""). The desire to die is present, even if acting on it is currently inhibited.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""contemplating suicide,"" ""offing myself"").
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""I want to die"").
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states they *don't act* on them due to a specific reason (self-punishment), not because they don't want the thoughts or the death itself. The desire to die is affirmed.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes. Detailed methods (isopropyl alcohol, noose, jumping in front of car) and preparations (testing, planning to avoid detection) are explicitly described.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes (""tested the strength,"" ""figured out how to ensure"").
    *   The author explicitly states ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past *planning* and current *contemplation* and *possession of plans*.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. All descriptions are of *planning* or *contemplation*, not initiated actions. The author explicitly states, ""But I don't do it.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent.
    *   Not solely 'Ideation' because the post goes beyond just thoughts/desire and includes detailed mentions of specific plans, methods, and preparations.
    *   Not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent *initiated action* (that was potentially lethal) is described. The post clearly states the author *hasn't* acted on these plans (""But I don't do it"").
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" The detailed descriptions of calculating alcohol amounts, testing noose points, and having ""the plans"" are clear indicators of 'Behavior'.

432,"calling people?. the day i chose is very soon. today i had the urge to call my grandparents, i love them a lot and haven't spoken to them in a while. kind of want to call and talk to them but part of me thinks it might be a bad idea, i don't want them to think the phone call was me trying to be talked down or something. tensions are really high and everything is fucked up in my family but i think they'd be happy to hear from me? i'm on the side of just not calling anyone but i'm not sure if that's the right idea. same with telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother. not sure if that would like, haunt people more or something. what do you guys think?. i know a bunch of people are going to tell me that if i have people that love me i shouldn't kill myself. i'm not interested in being talked down at all, i know i might end up in hell / that whatever comes after this might be worse, i know i'm selfish and weak and all that, i've heard it all and i'm not at all interested in anti suicide discourse. i've wanted to do this for over a decade. i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly states ""kill myself,"" ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade,"" ""not cut out for life.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden (implied by not wanting to ""haunt people"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        - ""the day i chose is very soon."" (This indicates a specific, near-future timeframe for the act, which is a form of planning/preparation).
        - ""kind of want to call and talk to them... same with telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother. not sure if that would like, haunt people more or something."" (This is a clear deliberation about ""final goodbyes,"" which is a common and significant preparation for suicide).
    - References to past actions: ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to long-standing ideation, not a past attempt.
    - Imminence: ""the day i chose is very soon."" (High imminence).
    - Stated desire: Clear desire to die/commit suicide, and an explicit rejection of intervention (""not interested in being talked down at all,"" ""not at all interested in anti suicide discourse"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I've wanted to do this for over a decade,"" ""i'm not cut out for life"").
    - The writer explicitly rejects being talked down, indicating a firm desire to act on these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned.
    - However, there are strong signs of preparation and a temporal plan:
        - ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates a fixed, near-future timeframe. This is a crucial element of a plan.
        - The deliberation about ""calling grandparents,"" ""telling friends I love them,"" and ""hugging my little brother"" are clear indications of contemplating final goodbyes, which are recognized preparations for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current intention (""the day i chose is very soon"") and preparations for a future act.
    - It does *not* describe a past or very recent *initiated* potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and desire to die.
    - It's not just 'Ideation' because it goes beyond mere thoughts or desires. The post includes elements of planning (""the day i chose is very soon"") and clear preparations (contemplating final goodbyes). While a specific *method* isn't named, the presence of a chosen *timeframe* and the contemplation of *preparations* (goodbyes) fit the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent initiated action is described.

Based on the presence of explicit suicidal intent, a chosen timeframe for the act, and clear contemplation of preparations (final goodbyes), the post falls under 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""most suicidal I've been""
    - Emotional indicators: ""pain for over 5 years"", ""cba anymore"" (can't be bothered anymore), ""misery"", ""abandoning everyone""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" refers to a past *state* of mind, not a past *action*.
    - Imminence: ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" suggests withdrawal, but no direct imminence for a suicidal act.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" clearly expresses a desire to end their suffering, implying a desire to die. ""most suicidal I've been"" directly states suicidal intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""most suicidal I've been"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I Just want to be out of my misery"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed personally.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" suggests withdrawal, but it's not a concrete preparation for a suicidal act (like acquiring means, writing a note).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state (""feel like abandoning everyone"", ""This the most suicidal I've been"") and a current desire (""I Just want to be out of my misery""). ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" is a future intention of withdrawal.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The phrase ""most suicidal I've been"" refers to a mental state, not an action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""most suicidal I've been"") and a desire to not be alive (""I Just want to be out of my misery""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - The intent is clear and personal, ruling out 'Indicator'.

    *   References to past actions: None.
    *   Imminence: Current desire, but no specific timeline.
    *   Writer's stated desire: A clear and explicit desire to die and kill themselves. This is not about unwanted thoughts, but a genuine wish.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I just want to kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to die.""

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP"" is a wish for someone else's death.
    - Emotional indicators: Anger, hostility, wishing harm upon another person. Not indicators of the author's own suicidal ideation (e.g., hopelessness, despair about self).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to the author's own actions.
    - References to past actions: The author's account was banned, which is a past event, but not a suicidal action.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""ASAP"" refers to the desired death of another person.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire for *another person* to die, not themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No, the desire for death is directed at a third party (""the guy who reported my post"").
    - Does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? N/A, as no suicidal thoughts for the author are expressed.

    *Crucial point from rules:* ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned."" This post expresses a death wish for someone else, not the author.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No plan, method, or preparation for the author's own suicide is mentioned or implied.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past event (account banned) and a current wish for future harm to another person. No self-initiated, potentially lethal action by the author is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post does not contain any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, feelings, desire to die, plans, or past attempts by the author. It is a hostile statement directed at someone else.
    - According to the definitions:
        - 'Ideation' requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer"" *by the author*. This is not present.
        - 'Behavior' requires a plan/method for the author's own suicide. This is not present.
        - 'Attempt' requires a past self-initiated potentially lethal action by the author. This is not present.
        - 'Indicator' states: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.**"" While this post is hostile, it clearly lacks any *personal* suicidal intent from the author. The core criterion for 'Indicator' (lack of personal suicidal intent) is met. The post is not about the author's own suicidal risk.

    Therefore, based on the strict interpretation that the risk must correspond to the person writing the post and the absence of any self-directed suicidal content, 'Indicator' is the correct classification.

Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""I will kill my bullie,"" ""I will kill her,"" and ""how to murder her."" It also mentions ""type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others,"" which is a reference to suicide, but the intent is directed outwards.
    - Emotional indicators: Extreme frustration, anger, desire for peace by eliminating a perceived threat.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The author asks for ""suggestion of how to murder her,"" indicating a desire for a method but no specific method is stated by the author yet. No preparations are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""I tried every possible thing to make her stop"" refers to past attempts to stop bullying, not past suicidal or homicidal actions.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""I will kill her"" is a stated future intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states a desire to kill another person (""her"") to ""finally live my life in peace."" There is no stated desire for the author to die or harm themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not for the author themselves. The mention of ""type of suicide"" is in the context of killing others, not self-harm.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The desire is to kill another person.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? N/A, as personal suicidal thoughts are not the focus.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, and the intent is homicidal, not suicidal. The author asks for suggestions on how to murder, indicating a lack of a specific plan yet.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention to kill someone else (""I will kill her"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a desire and intent to harm *another person* (homicide), not to harm *themselves*.
    - The provided categories are for *suicide risk*. The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    - Since there is no personal suicidal intent or action described by the author, the post does not fit the definitions of 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt', as these all require the author's own suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.
    - 'Indicator' is defined as a post that ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" It may express ""general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly.""
    - The post expresses significant distress and anger. While the primary intent is homicidal, the post *does* mention ""type of suicide"" (even if in a homicidal context) and expresses general distress. Since there is no personal suicidal intent, by elimination and strict adherence to the definition of 'Indicator' (lacking personal suicidal intent), this is the most appropriate category among the given choices, despite the primary focus being homicide. The post does not indicate a risk of suicide for the author themselves.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""cannot do this anymore,"" ""mental health really bad,"" ""stress,"" ""disappointment and failure.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" strongly implies the existence of a specific plan or method in the writer's mind, even if not explicitly detailed.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""on the verge of suicide,"" ""cannot do this anymore"" suggests current, intense distress and potential imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to ""end it all,"" ""kill myself.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""end it all.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" indicates that the writer has a specific plan or method in mind, even if it is not detailed in the post. This goes beyond mere ideation and suggests a concrete mental preparation for an action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current state (""on the verge"") and a future intention (""I know exactly what to do"").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" is key. While it doesn't *detail* the method or plan, it signifies that the author has a specific approach in mind. This moves it beyond simple 'Ideation' (which is thoughts/desire without a plan) and into 'Behavior' (which includes mentioning a plan, method, or preparations, even if briefly or implicitly).
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current desire/intention.
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""I just wanna die"") and a plea for death (""Someone kill me""). This clearly moves it beyond 'Indicator', which lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the clear personal expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to not be alive, without any specific plan or method, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None. The post expresses a desire for ""all thoughts away from my mind,"" ""all gayness away,"" ""all gender dysphoria away,"" ""all depression away,"" and ""everything negative out my life."" This is a desire for transformation and relief from suffering, not for death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""tired of being male attracted to other males,"" ""tired of being unhappy lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed and always rejected,"" ""unhappy life."" These are strong indicators of distress, despair, and unhappiness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""molested at 5 years,"" ""raise by mostly women doing girl things,"" ""26 always had unhappy life."" These are past life circumstances, not past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: Not applicable as no suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states a desire to be ""normal"" and for their current suffering (gender dysphoria, depression, being gay, rejection, unhappiness) to end, primarily through divine intervention (""Please god make me straight please make me normal,"" ""please take all thoughts away from my mind,"" ""do a miracle""). There is no stated desire to die or not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The desire is for their current state of suffering to end and to become ""normal,"" not for their life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all. The request to ""take all thoughts away from my mind"" refers to the distressing thoughts related to their identity and depression, not suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past life events and current intense emotional distress, with a plea for future change.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post exhibits significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and unhappiness (""tired of being unhappy lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed"").
    - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or any suicidal intent. The plea is for a change in circumstances and internal state (""make me normal,"" ""take all gayness away,"" ""take all depression away""), not for an end to life.
    - There are no plans, methods, preparations, or past initiated actions related to suicide.
    - Based on the definitions, this post clearly fits the 'Indicator' category, as it expresses general distress and hopelessness without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly asks ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"". This is a direct mention of ""suicidal"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts."" ""no change in sight."" These indicate severe frustration, despair, and hopelessness related to chronic pain.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not applicable as no direct intention is stated.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer asks ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"". While a question, it strongly implies the writer is experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings due to their pain and is seeking others who relate. It's not explicitly stating ""I want to die,"" but it's a clear personal connection to the concept of being ""suicidal"" in the context of their suffering.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? While phrased as a question (""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?""), the context of severe, chronic, unresolving pain (""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. ... no change in sight."") strongly suggests the author is personally experiencing or contemplating suicidal thoughts. It's an implicit but strong personal expression of suicidal ideation. It's not expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts; rather, it's seeking connection on a shared experience of being ""suicidal"" due to pain.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of pain and a current query about suicidal feelings related to it.
    - Crucially, does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post directly uses the word ""suicidal"" in a personal context related to the author's suffering. This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide, indicating a personal experience of suicidal thoughts or feelings. Therefore, it's more than an 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The phrasing ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" strongly implies the author is experiencing suicidal thoughts due to their pain, fitting the definition of 'Ideation' where there are ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer,"" even if phrased as a question to find solidarity rather than a direct ""I am suicidal."" The context makes it a clear personal expression.

442,"Will somebody just love me. This year has absolutely destroyed me mentally. I don't think I can go on much longer. Everything feels like a road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose. My substance abuse is rooted in the need to be loved. Does anyone else feel this way? I'm married and I feel alone in my own head. I wish my partner would care about me the way I do about them. I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need. The damage that caused me has been irreparable. Fuck polyamory and open relationships too. I hate now this is normalized now. Not only do I feel distant from my friends, family and everything else around me but also my lover who's supposed to guide me through this pain and make me feel right. After covid, all the other shite that's happened this year too. I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over. I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death and not feel so guilty. Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again. The only person who truly understands the pain I'm feeling",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""I'm over life,"" ""One last record for me to make and its finally over,"" ""finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death."" Also mentions someone else's suicide (""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life"") which gives comfort.
    - Emotional indicators: ""destroyed me mentally,"" ""pain,"" ""nothingness of no purpose,"" ""alone,"" ""abandoned,"" ""ruined me,"" ""irreparable,"" ""distant,"" ""hate,"" ""guilty.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This implies a specific task or condition to be met before acting on the suicidal intent. While not a method, it functions as a preparation or pre-condition.
    - References to past actions: Mentions a loved one's suicide, but no past *self-initiated* suicidal actions by the author.
    - Imminence: ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" suggests a defined, albeit personal, timeline.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/end life (""I'm over life,"" ""looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No explicit ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but strong, direct expressions of desire to die: ""I'm over life,"" ""it's finally over,"" ""give in to the nothingness that is death."" Yes, there is clear desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a clear desire to act on these thoughts and ""give in to the nothingness that is death.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" indicates a specific, final task or preparation that needs to be completed before the stated end. This is a preparatory step for the suicidal intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a clear future intention (""I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over. I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""I'm over life,"" ""give in to the nothingness that is death""), which moves it past 'Indicator'.
    - The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" implies a specific preparatory step or pre-condition before the stated end. While not a specific method, it functions as a preparation or a task to be completed before enacting the suicidal intent. This moves it beyond simple 'Ideation' into 'Behavior' because it includes a preparatory element.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit desire to die and the mention of a specific, final task/preparation (""One last record for me to make and its finally over"") before the stated end, the classification is Behavior.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I want to die"".
    - Emotional indicators: Anger, resentment, desire for revenge/pain for others (""I want to make my mom feel pain,"" ""she belittles me,"" ""so she can feel pain and hurt""). This indicates significant distress.

    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention (""I want to die"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator' as it goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out the desire to die. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I've started to try and starve myself"" (self-harm/method), ""won't be as painful as hanging myself"" (method), ""I'd prefer having access to a gun"" (method), ""I'll at least be dead by the end of the week"" (imminent death), ""I just want my death to come faster"" (desire for death).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** hopelessness (""lost everything,"" ""can't do anything right,"" ""useless,"" ""nuisance""), despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I've started to try and starve myself"" indicates an *initiated action* and a method. ""hanging myself"" and ""access to a gun"" are other methods considered/desired. ""dead by the end of the week"" provides a temporal context for the initiated action.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've started to try and starve myself"" describes an action that has already begun.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""dead by the end of the week"" is a clear, imminent timeframe.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A clear and strong desire to die (""I just want my death to come faster"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not directly ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""hanging myself"" and ""access to a gun"" are direct methods of suicide, and the desire for death is explicit.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want my death to come faster,"" ""I'll at least be dead by the end of the week.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a clear desire to act on them and has initiated an action.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""gun.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I've started to try and starve myself"" is an *ongoing initiation* of a method, which goes beyond mere preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. ""I've started to try and starve myself"" is a current, ongoing initiated action. The desire for death by the end of the week is a future intention tied to this action.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""I've started to try and starve myself."" This is a self-initiated action with lethal intent, even if slow. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" Starvation, when initiated with the intent to die, is a potentially lethal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes specific methods and an *initiated action* (""I've started to try and starve myself""), which goes beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    *   The phrase ""I've started to try and starve myself"" describes a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that is currently underway. This fits the definition of 'Attempt' (""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions... that were potentially lethal""). While starvation is a slower method, the initiation of it with lethal intent qualifies as an attempt under the given definitions. The mention of other methods (hanging, gun) and clear desire for death reinforce the severity, but the *initiated action* is the key differentiator for 'Attempt'.

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current and ongoing intention/planning (""I plan my suicide every single day"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""suicidale all my life."" Mentions ""tried to cut my wrists,"" ""laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over,"" ""jumped in front of a train"" (all past actions). Most importantly, ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" (a very recent, initiated action). ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"" (current intention).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""chicken,"" ""can't leave him alone down here,"" ""felt so dirty,"" ""I can't go on like this,"" ""nightmares every night,"" ""I have nobody,"" ""life is just full of rape, abuse and suffering."" (Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, and severe distress).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" is a specific method and an initiated action.
    *   **References to past actions:** Multiple clear references to past suicide attempts: ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists,"" ""When I was 19 I laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over,"" ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train.""
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I just stood on a chair... Today I failed..."" indicates a very recent (today) initiated action. ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"" indicates current contemplation of action.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die, despite the struggle to complete the act (""I just can't pull myself togehter and just do it""). The ""chicken"" remark indicates a struggle with the act itself, not a lack of desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidale."" The context of ""do it"" also clearly refers to suicide.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't go on like this,"" and the history of attempts and current contemplation.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to act, even if they struggle with the final step.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""rope around my neck"" and ""stood on a chair"" are specific methods/tools.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" implies preparation and initiation of the act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, multiple times:
        *   ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck."" This is a very recent (today), specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action, even though it was not completed (""Today I failed because...""). This directly fits the 'Attempt' definition's example: ""I tried to hang myself today but I stopped right before passing out.""
        *   Past actions: ""tried to cut my wrists,"" ""laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over,"" ""jumped in front of a train"" are all clear descriptions of past initiated, potentially lethal actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It mentions not just ideation, but specific methods and preparations for a very recent action (""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck""), which leans towards 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.
    *   However, the key is that the post describes *initiated actions* that were potentially lethal, both in the past and very recently. The phrase ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck. well but I'm a chicken. I've been suicidale all my life. ... But everytime I try I fail. Today I failed..."" describes a concrete, potentially lethal action that was initiated today, even if it was interrupted or failed. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The presence of multiple past attempts further solidifies this classification.

The word ""suicidal"" is directly used in a question about their own state.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""future is really grim,"" ""not worth pushing my life further."" This indicates hopelessness and a lack of desire to continue living or prolong life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states, ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it."" It mentions ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" and ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" which is a passive stance of not seeking to prolong life, rather than an active plan to *cause* death.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I have stopped visiting the doctor's."" This is a past action, but it's an omission of care, not an initiated lethal act.
    *   **Imminence:** No specific imminence for an active suicidal act. The acceptance of death is general (""when my time has come,"" ""at 50 or earlier"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a clear passive desire for death or a lack of desire to live/prolong life (""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" ""not worth pushing my life further""). They are not expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts; rather, they seem to be accepting these thoughts/feelings.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"":** Yes, the post uses ""suicidal"" directly in relation to their own behavior/thoughts.
    *   **Clear desire to die or not be alive:** Yes, phrases like ""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" and ""not worth pushing my life further"" indicate a passive desire for death or a lack of desire to live.
    *   **Writer explicitly states they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them:** No, the writer is expressing acceptance of this state, not a desire to fight it.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Specific method, tool, substance, or location:** No. ""Stopped visiting the doctor's"" is an omission of care, not an active method to cause death. The post explicitly states ""I don't have any plans to end it.""
    *   **Signs of preparation:** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Past event, current/future intention:** Describes a current state of mind and a past omission (""stopped visiting the doctor's""). The acceptance of death is a current/future intention.
    *   **Specific, potentially lethal action initiated:** No. ""Stopped visiting the doctor's"" is an omission, not an initiated lethal action as defined for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it expresses a clear, personal, current passive desire for death or a lack of desire to live (""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come""). The question ""Is it suicidal..."" also points to a personal awareness of suicidal thinking.
    *   It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparations to actively *cause* death (Behavior). The statement ""I don't have any plans to end it"" confirms the absence of a plan. The omission of doctor visits is passive and does not constitute an active plan to cause death.
    *   It does not describe a past or very recent *initiated lethal action* (Attempt). The omission of care is not an initiated lethal act.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear personal desire to not prolong life and a passive acceptance of death, without any active plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

    - Writer's stated desire: The phrase ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" indicates that the thought of killing themselves is present, even if they feel inhibited from acting on it due to perceived cowardice. It's not a statement that they *don't* want to die, but that they feel unable to act on the thought. This suggests the presence of suicidal ideation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" implies the presence of the thought/desire, even if there's a perceived barrier to acting on it. It's a personal expression of a suicidal thought.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The ""too much of a coward"" part indicates an inability to act, but not a rejection of the thought itself or an explicit statement that they *don't* want to die. It's more about a perceived personal failing preventing action. This leans towards ideation because the thought is clearly present and personal.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current feelings and thoughts.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains an explicit personal expression of a suicidal thought (""kill myself"") in the context of intense self-hatred and depression.
    - Although the user states they are ""too much of a coward"" to act on it, this does not negate the presence of the suicidal thought itself. It's not framed as an unwanted intrusive thought, but rather as something they feel unable to do. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it's an ""explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings.""
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - It goes beyond general distress and abstract discussion of suicide, making it more than an 'Indicator'.

449,"The simplest ways to help a friend who is struggling are often the most forgotten. A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it. Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""thinking about suicide"" but explicitly attributes these thoughts to a ""friend who is struggling,"" not the author themselves.

    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None from the author.
    - Imminence of intentions: Not applicable, as the author is discussing helping others.

    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as the thoughts are not the author's.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned or the desire is clearly negated or unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. The post discusses suicide in a general, advisory context, not as a personal expression of the author's intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""no reason to live"" - indicates a lack of desire to continue living.
        *   ""I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that."" - Direct mention of suicide and personal acceptance/contentment with it.
        *   ""will only drive me further to killing myself."" - Direct mention of killing myself.
        *   ""nature is just telling me it's time to die."" - Direct mention of dying.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, isolation (""no one anymore,"" ""no one""), feeling like a ""waste of life.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:**
        *   The mention of ""took my last Ativan today"" and ""doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me"" describes the loss of a coping mechanism and a perceived lack of future, but it does *not* describe Ativan as a *method* for suicide, nor does it describe a plan to use it for that purpose. It's about the *absence* of a barrier, not the *presence* of a method.
        *   No other specific method (e.g., overdose on X, jump from Y, specific weapon), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, giving things away) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal *actions* are described. The Ativan mention is about current use as a coping mechanism, not a past attempt.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""finally becoming content with that [suicide],"" ""will only drive me further to killing myself,"" ""it's time to die."" These phrases indicate a present and future intent, and a growing acceptance of suicide.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to die or not be alive, and an acceptance/contentment with suicide as a potential outcome. This is not about unwanted thoughts, but a shift towards embracing them.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes (""suicide,"" ""killing myself"").
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes (""no reason to live,"" ""finally becoming content with that,"" ""it's time to die"").
    *   Does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite, they state they are ""finally becoming content with that.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The Ativan reference is about its absence as a coping mechanism, not its use as a suicidal method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a future trajectory (""will only drive me further to killing myself,"" ""it's time to die"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. There is no description of an initiated suicidal act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""no reason to live,"" ""content with that [suicide],"" ""killing myself,"" ""time to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   However, the post does *not* mention any specific plan, method, or preparations for carrying out suicide (e.g., ""I'm going to overdose on X,"" ""I have a gun,"" ""I'm writing a note""). The Ativan mention is about the loss of a coping mechanism, not a suicidal method. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated* suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The content aligns perfectly with 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings or a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""drowning yourself,"" ""guaranteed death,"" ""slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean,"" ""transition to death.""
    - Emotional indicators: The phrase ""I think its the best option for me"" and the condition ""If I get kicked out of my house"" imply significant distress and a desire for an end to suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: A specific method (""drowning yourself"") and a specific location (""bottom of the ocean"") are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Conditional (""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that""), but the intention is clear if the condition is met.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to die, expressed as ""best option for me"" and ""nice smooth transition to death.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""drowning yourself"" is a direct method of self-killing.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I think its the best option for me,"" ""guaranteed death,"" ""A nice smooth transition to death.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the writer is exploring it as a desired option.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""drowning yourself"" is a specific method, and ""bottom of the ocean"" is a specific location.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation, but the detailed consideration of a specific method and location constitutes a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A future intention, conditional on an event.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die and is not just general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by mentioning a specific method (""drowning yourself"") and a specific location (""bottom of the ocean""). This constitutes a plan, even if conditional. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    - The presence of a specific method and location points directly to 'Behavior'.

I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""not to kill myself"", ""suicide attempts"". These are explicit mentions of suicidal concepts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses a positive feeling (""all I've ever wanted,"" ""hopefully postpone"") in relation to Star Wars, which serves as a protective factor. However, the very need for a ""reason not to kill myself"" and the mention of ""postpone any suicide attempts"" clearly indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts or tendencies. The ""lol"" might be a coping mechanism or an attempt to lighten the mood, but it doesn't negate the underlying serious content.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The phrase ""suicide attempts"" is general and does not specify a method, tool, location, or preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" does not describe a *specific, initiated past action*. It refers to the general concept of future potential attempts or ongoing ideation that is now being delayed. It's not ""I tried to kill myself yesterday"" but ""I have this tendency, and now I'm delaying it.""
    *   **Imminence:** The intent is to ""postpone"" for ""the next decade or so,"" implying a delay of future potential actions, not an immediate plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states ""not to kill myself"" *because* of Star Wars. However, the fact that suicide attempts are something to be ""postponed"" indicates that the desire to die or suicidal thoughts are present for the author, even if currently being counteracted by a protective factor. The core is that suicidal ideation *exists* for this person.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself,"" ""suicide attempts.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? It implies that such a desire or tendency *exists* for the author, as it's something they need a reason *not* to do and something they are ""postponing."" While Star Wars provides a reason to *not* act, the underlying ideation is clearly present.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? They state they ""need to know what happens"" in Star Wars, which is a reason *not* to act, but the underlying presence of ""suicide attempts"" as a personal possibility is undeniable. This is not ""I don't want these thoughts""; it's ""I have these thoughts/tendencies, but I'm putting them off.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current reason to delay *future* potential actions (""postpone any suicide attempts"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" refers to the *concept* of attempts or the ongoing tendency towards them, not a concrete, initiated past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts/tendencies (""kill myself,"" ""suicide attempts"" as something to be postponed), making it stronger than 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a specific, initiated past suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer (which is currently being postponed), but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are mentioned. The ""again"" refers to the return of the feeling, not a past attempt.
    - Imminence: The feelings are current (""Feel like dying again,"" ""I'm back to feeling like shit"").
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die (""Feel like dying again,"" ""Just kill me"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""Just kill me"" and ""Feel like dying again,"" which are direct phrases expressing a personal desire to die.
    - The post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive.
    - The writer does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them; rather, the desire is stated as a personal feeling.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge), tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned or implied.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current intention/feeling (""Feel like dying again,"" ""I'm back to feeling like shit"").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die (""Just kill me,"" ""Feel like dying again"").
    - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past or very recent initiated action is described.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

457,My landlord called for the smell of a Dead Body. My landlord is clearly trying to get me out of my apartment. My neighbors have been purposely keeping me awake. I've probably slept an hour every night for I dont even know how many nights anymore. The landlord had one of em call or the landlord himself called and reported the dead body smell. No smell was found by the cops. I'm so tired. My heads messing with me. I just wanna leave this place. I got diagnosed with MS recently it's hard to deal. I just know I'm gonna be wakened if I fall asleep. It never fails. I cant take this torture from these people. I want to leave. I have no money to just walk out or i would. I dont know what options I have left. I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""smell of a Dead Body"" but this is attributed to the landlord's false accusation, not the author's intent or desire to die. There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm so tired,"" ""My heads messing with me,"" ""It's hard to deal,"" ""I cant take this torture from these people,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs."" These indicate extreme distress, exhaustion, paranoia, and a feeling of being trapped and persecuted.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to self-harm or suicide.
    - Imminence: No stated intentions of self-harm.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a strong desire to ""leave this place"" (the apartment) and escape the ""torture,"" but *not* a desire to die or end their life. They state ""I have no money to just walk out or i would."" and ""I don't know what options I have left"" in the context of their living situation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The desire is to leave the apartment and escape the current situation, not to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, ongoing distressing situation.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses significant distress, hopelessness about their current situation, paranoia, and a feeling of being tortured and trapped (""I cant take this torture from these people,"" ""I don't know what options I have left,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell"").
    - However, crucially, there is no explicit personal expression of a desire to die or suicidal intent. The desire to ""leave this place"" is about the apartment, not life. The ""dead body"" reference is about a false accusation.
    - Because there is general distress and hopelessness but *no clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author*, it fits the definition of 'Indicator'. It expresses distress and a lack of options in a difficult situation, but not suicidal ideation.

458,"My parents don't love me. I have nobody :). Possible suicide date is in July. Too bad I'm fucking debating it because of my friends. I'll never be a real woman. I don't know why I cling onto ""hope"". I don't even know who I am anymore if I'm being honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""Possible suicide date is in July"" directly mentions suicide and a potential timeline.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My parents don't love me,"" ""I have nobody,"" ""debating it because of my friends,"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope',"" ""I don't even know who I am anymore."" These express profound loneliness, despair, identity confusion, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), tool, location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. A *date* is mentioned, but this is not a method or preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""in July"" suggests a future intention, not immediate.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The mention of a ""possible suicide date"" clearly indicates a personal consideration and desire to die, even though they are ""debating it"" due to friends. The debate is about whether to act, not about the thoughts being unwanted.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""Possible suicide date is in July.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the consideration of a ""suicide date"" implies a desire, despite the internal conflict.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is *debating* acting on them, not rejecting the thoughts as unwanted.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. A potential date is mentioned, but this is not a preparation or method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""Possible suicide date is in July"") and current internal debate.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""Possible suicide date is in July"") and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific means like pills/gun, or actions like writing a note), which rules out 'Behavior'. A date is not a method or preparation.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

459,Happy people makes me suicidal. Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts because I know I will always be a loser who will never make friends. It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""sad,"" ""hurts so much,"" ""loser,"" ""never make friends.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The post states ""I will probably never kill myself,"" which negates imminence and intent to act.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin."" This indicates that while they experience suicidal thoughts, they *do not* have a current desire or intent to act on them due to a strong personal barrier (religious belief). They are expressing distress about having the thoughts and their life situation, but not a desire to die by suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. It explicitly states ""I will probably never kill myself."" This negates the desire to act on the thoughts.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin."" This clearly indicates they do not want to act on the thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and thoughts (""get sad and have suicidal thoughts"") but explicitly negates any future intention to act on them (""I will probably never kill myself"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself,"" but crucially, the author explicitly states they ""will probably never kill myself"" due to religious reasons. This means that while they experience the thoughts, they do not express a *current personal desire to die or suicidal intent* to act on those thoughts.
    - According to the definition of 'Indicator': ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die."" This perfectly matches the post's content. The author is expressing distress and having thoughts, but not an intent to act.
    - It is not 'Ideation' because 'Ideation' requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which is negated by the statement ""I will probably never kill myself.""
    - There is no plan or method, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no past initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate classification.

I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic. No one from my real life, no classmates or family, none of them. just some random woman who lives on an entire different continent. I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve. I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one. this year has been such a beautiful downward spiral it would be an amazing way to end it, no?. i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/suicide: ""ending it all"", ""suicide notes"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""awful year"", ""lonely bastard"", ""fucked it up"", ""fucking idiot"", ""no one wanted to be friends with me anymore"", ""tired of failing everyone"", ""can't fucking do another year"". High levels of despair, hopelessness, self-blame, isolation.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" (temporal plan), ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"" (preparation - suicide notes).
    - References to past actions: ""made 3 other suicide notes this year"" (past preparations, not past attempts).
    - Imminence: ""on new year's eve"", ""can't fucking do another year"".
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to ""end it all"", ""can't fucking do another year"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes"" and expresses a clear desire to ""end it all"" and ""not do another year"".
    - The writer does not negate these thoughts; they are presented as genuine intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or location is mentioned.
    - Yes, there is a clear sign of preparation: ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" This is a concrete preparatory act. The temporal context ""on new year's eve"" also indicates a planned timing.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes past preparations (""made 3 other suicide notes"") and a current/future intention (""thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"").
    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. Making notes is a preparation, not an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and desire to die.
    - It's not just 'Ideation' because, in addition to the desire to die, there is a clear element of preparation (""suicide notes"") and a temporal plan (""on new year's eve"").
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no concrete, potentially lethal action has been initiated or described as having been initiated. The notes are preparations for a future act, not an initiated attempt.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal intent (""ending it all"", ""suicide notes"") combined with clear preparations (""suicide notes"") and a planned timing (""on new year's eve"") fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""tried to cut myself,"" ""cut myself."" This is a direct mention of self-harm.
    - Emotional indicators: ""breakdown,"" ""very bad night,"" ""wanted to feel something real."" These indicate distress.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The method ""cut myself"" is mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""tried to cut myself last night."" This indicates a past, initiated action. ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"" provides context about the unusual nature of the act for the author.
    - Imminence: The action occurred ""last night,"" which is very recent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The motivation was ""wanted to feel something real,"" not explicitly a desire to die, but the act itself is a form of self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Not explicitly. The motivation was to ""feel something real.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The post states ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before,"" suggesting this was an atypical and perhaps unwanted action in a broader sense, but the action *was* initiated.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? ""cut myself"" is the method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the act itself implies some level of preparation (e.g., acquiring a cutting tool).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *past event*: ""I tried to cut myself last night.""
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, ""tried to cut myself last night"" describes a specific, self-initiated action. While the explicit intent to die is not stated, cutting can be a potentially lethal act depending on its severity. The key is that a concrete action was *initiated*. The definition of 'Attempt' includes actions that were ""potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly describes a *past, initiated physical action* of self-harm (""tried to cut myself last night"").
    - The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes **past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death**... A concrete, potentially life-threatening action by the author must have been *initiated*.""
    - The act of ""trying to cut oneself"" fits this definition, as it is a concrete, self-initiated action that can be potentially lethal depending on the circumstances, even if the explicit intent to die is not stated. It is a physical act that goes beyond mere thoughts (Ideation) or planning (Behavior).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing and no one"", ""no purpose to live"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""plan to kill myself"". While it doesn't detail a specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or specific preparations (e.g., writing a note), the word ""plan"" itself indicates a level of intention beyond just thinking about it.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""plan to kill myself"" suggests a current intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear, explicit desire to die is expressed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""plan to kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they state a plan.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method/tool/location.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations mentioned (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills"").
    - However, the definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a plan to commit suicide"". The phrase ""plan to kill myself"" directly matches this criterion. Even without a specific method, the explicit statement of a ""plan"" moves it beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""plan to kill myself"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes a future plan, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is clear, explicit suicidal intent and a stated desire to die, directly from the author.
    - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post explicitly states ""plan to kill myself"". The definition of 'Ideation' specifies ""without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned"". The inclusion of ""plan"" moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    - 'Behavior' fits best. The post includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die"" (""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live"") AND ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide"" (""plan to kill myself""). While a specific method isn't detailed, the explicit statement of a ""plan"" is sufficient for 'Behavior' based on the definition.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the post describes a future plan, not a past initiated action.

Therefore, the post falls under 'Behavior' due to the explicit statement of a ""plan to kill myself"".

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Key elements: Explicit mention of ""killing yourself soon.""
    - Emotional indicators: The tone is detached and practical, discussing the social implications of the act rather than raw emotion. The phrase ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"" indicates a firm resolve and lack of desire to be intervened with.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), location, or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The discussion is about *how* to inform others about the impending act, not the act itself.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""soon"" indicates a near-future intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die and commit suicide (""you'll be killing yourself soon""). The writer is not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts but rather contemplating the logistics of an intended act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing yourself soon.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and commit suicide.
    - The writer is not negating or expressing a desire to *not* act on the thoughts; they are discussing the social aspect of an intended act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    - No direct signs of preparation for the act itself (e.g., ""got the pills,"" ""wrote a note"") are mentioned. The discussion about ""letting folks know"" is a social consideration *around* the act, not a direct preparation for the act itself.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a future intention (""killing yourself soon"").
    - It does not describe a past or very recent specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent (""killing yourself soon"").
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past or very recent initiated action is described.
    - 'Behavior' is ruled out because, while there is clear intent and imminence (""soon""), there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or concrete preparation for the act itself (e.g., ""I'm going to use X method,"" ""I have Y tool,"" ""I'm writing Z note""). The discussion is about informing others, which is a social consideration, not a component of the suicidal act itself.
    - 'Ideation' fits best: The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""killing yourself soon"") but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out. The imminence (""soon"") and the firm resolve (""no worries of being stopped"") strengthen the ideation, but without a concrete method or preparation, it doesn't cross into 'Behavior'.

    - Emotional indicators: ""so fucking tired of everything,"" ""god damn it."" (Despair, exhaustion)
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""hang myself"" (method), ""at the woods"" (location), ""tonight"" (imminence/timeframe), ""play my favorite music ever"" (preparation/ritual).

    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die and act on it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die.
    - The desire is not negated or unwanted.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""hang myself"") and a specific location (""at the woods"") are mentioned. The timeframe ""tonight"" and the ritual ""play my favorite music ever"" also indicate planning/preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current intention for a future action (""tonight"").
    - It does not describe a past or very recent *initiated* potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit suicidal intent and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It includes a specific plan (method: ""hang myself"", location: ""at the woods"", timeframe: ""tonight""), which moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    - It describes a future intention, not a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I want to kill myself"" is explicitly stated.
    - Emotional indicators: ""truly alone forever,"" ""struggled daily with loneliness,"" ""no gf , friends and other stuff,"" ""What a joke,"" ""I hate pets, so it's not helping me either way."" These indicate deep despair, hopelessness, and social isolation.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching"" indicates a specific plan (timing). ""Already started to cancel friendships"" indicates preparations (disengaging from social ties). No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal *actions* are mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""I'm approaching"" the set date suggests imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I want to kill myself"" is a clear, genuine wish to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I want to kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly stated as personal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method (like pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""already set a date 2 weeks ago"" (a specific time-based plan) and ""Already started to cancel friendships"" (a preparatory action).
    - Given the desire to die and the presence of a set date (planning) and cancelling friendships (preparation), this leans towards 'Behavior'.

    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention (""I want to kill myself"") and future plans/preparations (""set a date,"" ""approaching,"" ""started to cancel friendships"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes planning and preparation for a future act, not an initiated attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent (""I want to kill myself"").
    - Not 'Ideation' because beyond just the desire/thoughts, there are concrete elements of planning (""set a date"") and preparation (""started to cancel friendships""). These go beyond mere ideation into actionable steps.
    - It fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions a plan (set a date) and preparations (cancelling friendships).
    - Not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent *initiated lethal action* is described. The actions described are planning and preparation.

Based on the explicit desire to die, the setting of a date, and the act of cancelling friendships, the post clearly indicates suicidal behavior.

Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""This life doesnt fit me,"" ""It never did,"" ""shithole,"" expresses deep dissatisfaction and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past actions or attempts are described. The phrase ""I have to so i dont kill myself"" refers to a current coping mechanism to prevent a future action.
    - Imminence of intentions: The phrase ""I have to so i dont kill myself"" indicates an ongoing, current struggle to prevent suicide. The question ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"" suggests a current contemplation and rationalization of suicide.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is actively doing things (""sleep all day,"" ""waste time"") ""so i dont kill myself,"" which implies that suicidal thoughts or urges are present and strong enough to require active prevention. The subsequent questioning of suicide's negative perception (""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"") suggests a personal consideration of suicide as an option, moving beyond just unwanted thoughts to a more personal engagement with the idea.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself"" and ""suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The phrase ""so i dont kill myself"" indicates that the writer is actively trying *not* to commit suicide, but this effort is necessitated by the presence of suicidal thoughts/urges. The follow-up question ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"" indicates a personal contemplation and rationalization of suicide, which strongly points to a personal engagement with the idea of dying by suicide. It's not a direct ""I want to die,"" but it's a clear personal struggle with suicidal ideation.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? While they are doing things to *prevent* acting, the questioning of suicide's badness suggests a deeper internal conflict and a personal consideration of suicide, rather than simply unwanted thoughts they wish to dismiss. This is more than just ""my brain says X, but I don't want to.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current struggle and contemplation.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator': The post goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion. The explicit mention of ""kill myself"" in the context of active prevention, and the personal questioning of suicide's nature, clearly indicate personal suicidal thoughts and engagement.
    - Fits 'Ideation': There are explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""so i dont kill myself"" implies constant struggle with these thoughts) and a clear contemplation/rationalization of suicide as a personal option (""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death""). There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    - Not 'Behavior': No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    - Not 'Attempt': No past or very recent initiated action is described.

467,I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it. Thats it I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it simple as that,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Key elements: ""I want to die"" is stated multiple times.
    - Emotional indicators: Clear expression of despair and a desire to end life.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The phrase ""too much of a coward to do it"" explicitly indicates a *lack* of current action or plan, despite the desire.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: No specific timeline.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear desire to die is expressed. However, this is immediately followed by a statement of inability to act on this desire.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of a desire for death.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The phrase ""too much of a coward to do it"" implies a current lack of intent to act, despite the desire. It's not a negation of the desire, but a negation of the ability/courage to act. This confirms a desire to die, but without a current plan or intent to execute.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Conclusion: No plan, method, or preparation is identified.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated? No, it explicitly states the opposite (""too much of a coward to do it"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I want to die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator', which is for general distress or *unwanted* thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out the desire. In fact, the post explicitly states an inability to act on the desire. This absence of a plan/method/preparation means it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Goodbye,"" ""throw myself off a bridge,"" ""suicidal,"" ""self-harmed,"" ""way of dying,"" ""last few seconds.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I cant take it,"" ""hated myself,"" ""tired of everything,"" ""at peace, no longer in pain"" (this ""peace"" is in the context of ending life, indicating resolution to die).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""throw myself off a bridge"" (specific method and location), ""Ive planned it all out"" (explicit planning), ""locked in the bathroom"" (isolation, a form of preparation/prelude).
    - References to past actions: ""suicidal since i was 9,"" ""i self-harmed."" These are background, but the core of the post is current intent.
    - Imminence: ""possibly my last vent,"" ""last few seconds."" High imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die, ""decide to throw myself off a bridge,"" ""this is just a way of dying.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method/location is mentioned: ""throw myself off a bridge.""
    - Yes, signs of preparation are mentioned: ""Ive planned it all out,"" ""locked in the bathroom.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention: ""going to throw myself off a bridge,"" ""Ive planned it all out.""
    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* in the past or very recently. While ""self-harmed"" is mentioned, it's not described as a specific, potentially lethal *attempt* that was initiated. The primary focus is on the current, imminent plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal intent and specific plan.
    - Not 'Ideation' because there is a specific method (""throw myself off a bridge"") and explicit planning (""Ive planned it all out"").
    - Not 'Attempt' because the post describes a *future* planned action, not a past or very recent *initiated* action. The past self-harm is mentioned but not as a specific, potentially lethal attempt.

Based on the explicit personal expression of suicidal desire, the mention of a specific method (""throw myself off a bridge""), and clear signs of planning (""Ive planned it all out,"" ""locked in the bathroom""), the post fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I'm gonna commit suicide,"" ""die of blood loss."" The phrase ""twist my dick off"" is presented as a method leading to ""die of blood loss.""
    - Emotional indicators: Clear intent to end life, despair.

    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""I'm gonna..."" indicates current/future intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die and commit suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:

    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm gonna commit suicide,"" ""die of blood loss.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a clear intent to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""twist my dick off"" (as a means leading to) and ""die of blood loss"" are explicitly stated as the method for suicide.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation, but a method is clearly stated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""I'm gonna..."").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it describes a future intention, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""I'm gonna commit suicide""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post also mentions a specific method (""twist my dick off"" leading to ""die of blood loss""). This presence of a stated method moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    - It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the combination of explicit suicidal intent and a stated method (even if graphic and unusual) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""wants to die"" is explicitly stated. The concept of ""going to hell"" is discussed in the context of dying/suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Idk how to word this without sounding dumb,"" ""afraid of stupid little things,"" ""worrying about it,"" ""sorry to talk about this subject,"" ""sound dumb,"" ""whining about something as dumb as religious stuff,"" ""feeling really isolated,"" ""can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.""

    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to die, but a *fear* (of hell) is preventing them from acting on that desire, not a lack of desire itself. The phrase ""one of the only things keeping me alive"" confirms the underlying desire to die.

For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'.

I need help and I can't get it from anywhere.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"" (past thoughts). ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" implies a desire not to be alive if not for the brother. ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" suggests a breaking point related to continuing to live.
    - Emotional indicators: ""crushed by stress,"" ""cried myself to sleep,"" ""boring,"" ""anxiety,"" ""crippled by stress and anxiety,"" ""no motivation,"" ""bottled up,"" ""need help and can't get it from anywhere."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, anhedonia.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"" refers to past *thoughts*, not initiated actions.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" suggests a potential future inability to cope, implying a risk of action if the coping mechanism fails.
    - Writer's stated desire: The statement ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" strongly implies a desire to die if that protective factor were absent. The past ""thought of killing myself multiple times"" confirms suicidal ideation. The current state of being ""crippled by stress and anxiety"" and not knowing ""how long I can cope"" suggests a current, active struggle with the desire to not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" implies a desire to not be alive were it not for the brother. The overall tone of overwhelming distress and inability to cope also points to a desire for the suffering to end, which often manifests as a desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states they *didn't* act on them in the past (""but I always thought of my little brother""), but the current statement ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" suggests the protective factor is being severely tested and the desire to die is a present struggle.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past thoughts (""I thought of killing myself multiple times"") and current overwhelming distress and a struggle to cope (""it has been getting much worse,"" ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. It describes past *thoughts*, not actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses more than general distress; it explicitly mentions past suicidal thoughts and a current state where the writer feels their only reason to live is their brother, combined with overwhelming stress and an inability to cope. This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The post describes explicit personal suicidal thoughts (past and implied current desire to not be alive) without a plan, method, or preparation. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

    *   Imminence: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the active seeking of information implies a current, strong desire.
    *   Writer's stated desire: A clear, strong, and personal desire to die. There is no indication that these are unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""how to die"" and ""definitely die"" are direct expressions of a desire for death.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to definitely die.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the writer expresses a clear desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method is mentioned. The post is *asking* for information on how to die, which is a step towards seeking a method, but not a *stated* method or plan itself.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If there's a desire to die but no clear indication of plan/method/preparation, it's likely 'Ideation'. The post is *seeking* a method, not stating one.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current intention to find a way to die.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post contains a clear, explicit, personal desire to die (""I just want to definitely die""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, classifying it as 'Ideation' at minimum.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post expresses a strong desire to die and is actively seeking information on ""how to die."" While this active search is very serious and indicates a progression towards planning, the definition of 'Behavior' requires the *mention* of ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" The post *asks* for a method, it does not *state* that a method has been chosen or that preparations are underway. Therefore, it falls under 'Ideation' because there is explicit suicidal intent but no *stated* plan, method, or preparation. The user is seeking a plan, not stating they have one.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No past or very recent initiated actions are described.

Based on the strong personal desire to die and the active seeking of a method (but without *stating* a specific method or plan), the most appropriate category is 'Ideation'.

475,"It Never Quite Goes Away. I stick around for other people, but not because I want to be alive. It's not just that I don't see a future for myself, I just don't really want one either. It does get better, and then it gets worse, and then it gets better, and then worse, etc. I'm tired of buying time from myself over and over again. I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly? Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore. Maybe that's shitty. Maybe it's that 'indifference toward other people' that they were talking about when I got diagnosed with PTSD (still reeling from that one, it never seemed bad enough to me. Turns out not everyone lives in constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation). I just don't care. I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail. And in the meantime, I guess I'm still trying. I'm always trying.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I don't want to be alive,"" ""will to die,"" ""If I do it"" (referring to suicide), ""If I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail."" The explicit mention of a past ""attempt"" is crucial.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I don't see a future for myself, I just don't really want one either""), despair (""tired of buying time,"" ""tired of fighting to heal,"" ""constant fear and pain""), anhedonia/indifference (""I just don't care about them anymore,"" ""indifference toward other people"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation for a *current* or *future* act is mentioned. ""I've made enough plans to look forward to"" refers to life plans, not suicide plans. ""If I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail"" implies a future intention to choose an effective method, but doesn't state what that method is.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""If I do attempt again"" explicitly states a past suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""at least a few months out,"" ""I'm not in immediate danger."" Not immediate, but a clear future intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die/not be alive (""I don't want to be alive,"" ""will to die"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No direct use of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""will to die"" and ""If I do it"" (in context) clearly convey suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to be alive,"" ""will to die.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to die, even if they are ""buying time"" and are not in ""immediate danger."" The phrase ""If I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail"" reinforces a future intention to act on this desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        *   Past: ""If I do attempt again"" clearly indicates a past suicidal action.
        *   Current/Future: ""I don't want to be alive,"" ""will to die,"" ""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out,"" ""I'm not going to fail"" (future intention).
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, the phrase ""If I do attempt again"" directly refers to a past initiated suicidal action. The definition of 'Attempt' explicitly covers this: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal...""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   While there is strong ideation and future intention, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for a *current or future* act, which would be required for 'Behavior'.
    *   The defining element is the explicit mention of a past ""attempt."" The 'Attempt' definition states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" The use of the word ""attempt"" is a clear description of a past initiated action.

I've fucked my education up, I've fucked my relationships with other people up, I've fucked up everything in my life. I simply won't live a comfortable life in the slightest, it'll only continue to get worse as it always has. At the stage I'm at, I don't even want to live a comfortable life anymore, I don't want any more chances. I just want the pain to stop. I'm only 16 and I've gone through enough of it to last multiple lifetimes. I'm too afraid to use any method aside from a gun to the head, though.

High levels of despair, hopelessness, anhedonia, self-blame, and a clear desire for relief through death.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""how and when I'm going to take my life,"" ""gun to the head,"" ""grab a kitchen knife and do it there,"" ""Going by my plan."" The mention of specific methods (gun, kitchen knife) and a ""plan"" are crucial.
    - Past actions: None described.
    - Imminence: ""My temptations will soon get the better of me,"" ""haven't thought about anything other than how and when I'm going to take my life,"" ""I can't wait any more,"" ""Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there."" This indicates a strong, current, and escalating desire to act, despite a longer-term plan for a specific method.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear and explicit desire to die and end the pain.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""take my life"" is explicit.
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die (""I just want the pain to stop,"" ""free from everything,"" ""don't want to live a comfortable life anymore"").
    - The writer does not express a desire *not* to have these thoughts or *not* to act on them; rather, they describe being increasingly tempted.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, specific methods are mentioned: ""gun to the head"" and ""kitchen knife.""
    - Yes, there is a reference to a ""plan"" (""Going by my plan""). The ""kitchen knife"" thought is presented as an immediate, escalating temptation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current thoughts and future intentions (""soon get the better of me,"" ""I'm going to take my life,"" ""I still need to wait,"" ""Each day I've been more tempted"").
    - No specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses explicit personal suicidal intent and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond just ideation by mentioning specific methods (""gun to the head,"" ""kitchen knife"") and referring to a ""plan."" This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal act, so 'Attempt' is ruled out.
    - The presence of explicit intent and specific methods/plans firmly places it in 'Behavior'. The immediate temptation to use the kitchen knife highlights the current planning and means.

It just feels like everyone in my life is focused on their career goals and I can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly mentions ""thoughts of suicide."" Also, ""find the courage to actually live"" and ""convincing myself I deserve to live"" imply a struggle with the alternative (not living/dying).
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, low self-worth, struggle, seeking help.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The struggle is current (""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"").
    - Asses the writer's stated desire: The writer has ""thoughts of suicide"" but is also ""genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"" and is asking about inpatient care to help with these thoughts. This indicates a personal experience of suicidal thoughts and a struggle against them, but the thoughts themselves are present and personal.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""thoughts of suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? The presence of ""thoughts of suicide"" combined with the struggle to ""find the courage to actually live"" and ""convincing myself I deserve to live"" indicates a personal, current struggle with suicidal ideation. While they are fighting it, the ideation is clearly present and personal.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The author is asking about inpatient care to help with these thoughts and is trying to live, which shows a desire to manage or overcome the thoughts. However, the thoughts themselves are personal and present. This is not a case of ""my brain says X, but I don't want to"" where the desire is completely negated. Instead, the desire to live is a *struggle* against the suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current struggle and future intention to seek help.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""thoughts of suicide"" and describes a personal struggle with these thoughts (""find the courage to actually live,"" ""convincing myself I deserve to live""). This is a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of explicit ""thoughts of suicide"" as a personal experience, even if the author is seeking help to manage them, goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion. It fits the definition of 'Ideation' which includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer."" The struggle to live implies the presence of the counter-force (desire not to be alive).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge."" This directly mentions suicide and a specific method/location.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Another day of being mute,"" ""Everyday is the same,"" ""Nothing to say ever,"" ""Can't sleep,"" ""No future."" These convey profound hopelessness, despair, and a sense of stagnation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""kill myself on Monday. Bridge."" This indicates a specific day (""Monday"") and a specific method/location (""Bridge"").
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""on Monday"" indicates a specific, near-future intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I'm really going to try and kill myself"" clearly expresses a genuine desire to die and an intent to act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and an intent to act on it.
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method/location (""Bridge"") and a temporal plan (""on Monday"") are mentioned. This constitutes a clear plan.
    *   While not ""preparation"" in the sense of acquiring means or writing notes, the identification of a specific time and location/method is a key element of planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a future intention (""on Monday"").
    *   It does *not* describe a past or very recent specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The explicit personal expression of suicidal intent (""I'm really going to try and kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The presence of a specific plan (date ""on Monday"" and method/location ""Bridge"") rules out 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan).
    *   The description is of a *future intention* with a plan, not a *past initiated action*. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   The content perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Behavior': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die *AND* also mentions a plan (time) and a specific method/location.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/suicide: ""kms"" (kill myself) is used multiple times, ""when I do it,"" ""before I go.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Gah but it's so hard,"" ""One of the hardest decisions I've taken in my life,"" ""Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too"" (distress, difficulty with the decision).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track."" This implies a chosen method (""hangman's noose"") and its use as a motivational tool for the suicidal act (""to stay on track"" for ""kms""). ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms. Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it."" This indicates preparation by removing obstacles to the act.
    - References to past actions: ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" refers to a past action *related to* the future suicidal act, not a past initiated suicidal act itself.
    - Imminence: ""when I do it"" implies a determined future action. No specific time, but the intent is clear and resolute.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/commit suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""kms"" is explicitly mentioned multiple times.
    - Yes, there is a clear desire to die (""when I do it,"" ""before I go"").
    - The writer is not negating these thoughts; rather, they are actively pursuing them (""to stay on track"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method/tool is mentioned: ""hangman's noose."" While it's a wallpaper, the context ""just to stay on track"" for ""kms"" directly links it to the chosen method for the suicidal act.
    - Yes, signs of preparation are present: ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms. Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it."" This indicates removing an obstacle, which is a form of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current state of mind and a future intention.
    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. ""Overcame a big hurdle"" is about removing an obstacle, not an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses explicit personal suicidal intent (""kms,"" ""want to go""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly mentions a specific method/tool (""hangman's noose"" used ""to stay on track"") and describes overcoming an obstacle/preparation (""overcame a big hurdle to kms"" to ensure mom is not on the street). This goes beyond mere 'Ideation' (thoughts/desire only) and includes elements of a plan/method/preparation.
    - There is no description of a past *initiated* suicidal action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of a specific method (hangman's noose as a motivational tool for the act) and removal of obstacles/preparation points to 'Behavior'.

I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore. i'm only 19 and I feel like i've seen enough of my future to want to continue. someone please help me,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I want to die."" It also states ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore,"" which indicates a strong desire to escape current existence/suffering, often associated with suicidal ideation.
    - Emotional indicators: Pain, clutter, can't sleep, can't think straight, not supposed to be born, failure, anxiety, crying, not happy, no passions/desires. These show deep despair, hopelessness, and anhedonia.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence: No specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""soon"" is mentioned.
    - Writer's stated desire: The initial ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of desire to die. The later ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore"" shows a conflict but still expresses a desire for cessation of their current self/suffering, which is a form of suicidal ideation. The overall sentiment, especially the initial direct statement, points to a genuine wish to die or escape.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"" and ""I don't want to be me anymore.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The post has a contradictory statement: ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore."" However, the initial ""I want to die"" is a direct personal desire. The subsequent phrase ""I don't want to be me anymore"" reinforces the desire to escape existence, even if the word ""die"" is negated. This is not a clear statement of *unwanted* thoughts where the primary sentiment is distress about the thoughts themselves (e.g., ""my brain tells me X, but I don't want to""). Instead, it's a conflicted desire to cease existing as their current self.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current feelings and intentions.
    - It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I want to die,"" ""I don't want to be me anymore""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear personal desire to die/not be alive without a concrete plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" is a strong euphemism for suicide or ending one's life. ""he'll be better off without me"" also implies his absence/death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Can't take it anymore,"" ""failed my son,"" ""worthless as fuck."" These indicate extreme despair, hopelessness, and feeling like a burden.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I've been thinking about..."" indicates current, ongoing thoughts.
    - Stated desire: There is a clear stated desire to end his life or not be alive (""getting it over with,"" ""he'll be better off without me"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Can't take it anymore,"" ""he'll be better off without me,"" and ""thinking about just getting it over with"" all convey a clear desire to end his life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the thoughts are presented as something he is considering.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses clear personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""getting it over with,"" ""he'll be better off without me""). This rules out 'Indicator' because there is a clear personal desire.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category as it describes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan or past attempt.

WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die."" Describes multiple methods: ""120 extra strength aspirin pills,"" ""purchased a gun,"" ""aim it on my head,"" ""purchased rope,"" ""partial suspension hanging,"" ""exit bag set up,"" ""turned that gas valve.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared me,"" ""pain,"" ""nervous,"" ""panicked,"" ""shock,"" ""lonely,"" ""anxious,"" ""sad,"" ""alone,"" ""exhausted,"" ""despair,"" ""numb,"" ""empty.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   Past: ""took 120 extra strength aspirin pills,"" ""purchased a gun,"" ""did plenty of research,"" ""chambered my round,"" ""purchased rope,"" ""read up on partial suspension hanging,"" ""got into a remote location and went with the plan.""
        *   Current/Very Recent: ""Today, I have an exit bag set up,"" ""I've done it perfectly,"" ""turned that gas valve.""
    *   **References to past actions:** Detailed descriptions of past actions:
        *   Aspirin: ""At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills...I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after."" (Clear past attempt)
        *   Gun: ""At 21, I purchased a gun...chambered my round...pulled the trigger, nothing happened...couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again...led me to hospitalization."" (Clear past attempt)
        *   Rope: ""Just recently, I purchased rope...I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But...I gave up, my face purple and blotched."" (Clear past attempt)
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""Today, I have an exit bag set up."" ""When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked."" This indicates a very recent, initiated action.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** Despite fear, the writer states ""despair over my desire to die"" and has clearly acted on this desire multiple times. The fear is about the act itself or failure, not a negation of the desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""despair over my desire to die.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the fear is about the *pain* or *failure* of the act, not a rejection of the underlying desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, multiple times, both past and current: aspirin, gun, rope/hanging, exit bag/gas.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""purchased a gun,"" ""did plenty of research,"" ""purchased rope,"" ""read up on partial suspension hanging,"" ""I've made an exit bag,"" ""I've done it perfectly.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, this is the core of the post.
        *   Aspirin: ""I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills."" (Initiated, potentially lethal, led to hospitalization).
        *   Gun: ""I chambered my round...pulled the trigger, nothing happened."" (Initiated, potentially lethal, failed due to mechanical error, led to hospitalization).
        *   Rope: ""I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But...I gave up."" (Initiated, potentially lethal, stopped by self).
        *   Exit Bag/Gas: ""When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked...I turned off the gas."" (Initiated, potentially lethal, stopped by self).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:** The post provides detailed accounts of multiple past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions that were either interrupted, failed, or led to medical intervention. It also describes a very recent, initiated action (turning the gas valve) that was stopped. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The rule ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described"" applies here.

    - The post explicitly expresses a personal desire to die (""should just end my life"").
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - This clearly fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings or a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or preparations.

484,I'm about to kill myself. I don't see a reason to live. Life sucks.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is explicitly stated. ""don't see a reason to live"" expresses a desire to not be alive.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Life sucks"" indicates despair and hopelessness.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Since there is a clear desire to die but no plan, method, or preparation, this points towards 'Ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""I'm about to kill myself"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, it's a statement of intent, not a description of an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'm about to kill myself,"" ""I don't see a reason to live""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., how they plan to do it, what they will use, where they will go, or any steps taken). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - The post does not describe a past initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly, as it expresses clear suicidal intent without a concrete plan or past action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""face death"", ""until i die"", ""if not, well, you know what happened"" (strongly implies death).
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm done"", ""I'm too pissed"", ""don't even want to feel good anymore"", ""embrace the pain"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and anhedonia.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""I'm now gonna start working out until i die or pass out"". This is presented as a specific action/method intended to lead to death. The phrase ""until i die"" clearly defines the lethal intent of this action.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I'm now gonna start working out"", ""i'll be back in 12 hours if i survived"". This indicates immediate and time-bound intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear and explicit desire to die, expressed through the intent to ""face death"" and ""work out until i die"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""face death"", ""until i die"", and the implication of not returning (""if not, well, you know what happened"") clearly express a desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a clear intent to act on the desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""working out until i die or pass out"" is stated as the specific method. While unconventional, the explicit lethal intent (""until i die"") attached to this specific action makes it a plan/method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I'm now gonna start working out"" indicates immediate initiation of this ""plan"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current and immediate future intention: ""I'm now gonna start working out"".
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No, the action is stated as something that will *start now* and occur in the *future*. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, personal desire to die and a specific plan.
    - 'Ideation' is ruled out because there is not only a desire to die but also a specific method/plan (""working out until i die or pass out"") and immediate intent to carry it out.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the described action is a future intent, not a past or very recent initiated action.
    - 'Behavior' fits best. The post expresses explicit personal suicidal desire (""I'm done,"" ""face death,"" ""until i die"") AND outlines a specific, albeit unconventional, method/plan (""gonna start working out until i die or pass out"") with immediate intent to carry it out. The method is presented as a means to achieve death.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys a sense of resignation and a practical dilemma stemming from a firm suicidal intention. While not overtly emotional in terms of despair, the underlying context is one of a long-held and accepted suicidal intent.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparation (e.g., note writing, acquiring means) is mentioned. The timing is vague (""maybe in my 20's or 30's"").
    *   **References to past actions:** ""contemplated suicide for years"" refers to past thoughts/ideation, not past *actions* or attempts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" directly asks about the lethal potential of a substance.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The question combined with saving pills implies distress and contemplation of suicide.
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** ""duloxetine"" is a specific substance (method). ""a few pills"" are the means. ""saving for later"" indicates preparation and future intent to use them.
    *   **Past actions:** None mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** ""for later"" suggests a future, not immediate, intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The question about lethality coupled with saving the pills strongly implies a desire to use them for a lethal purpose, rather than just curiosity or distress about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the question ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" in the context of ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" implies a clear desire to use the pills for lethal purposes. It's not just a general question; it's linked to personal possession and future intent.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post does not negate the desire or intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? Yes, ""duloxetine"" and ""pills"" are a specific substance/method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" is a clear act of preparation (acquiring and holding onto means) and indicates a future intent to use them.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state (""I have a few pills"") and a future intention (""saving for later"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No, it describes preparation and future intent, not an initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there's more than general distress; there's implied suicidal intent with a specific method and preparation.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is a specific method (""duloxetine,"" ""pills"") and preparation (""saving for later"") mentioned, which goes beyond just thoughts or desire.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past or very recent initiated action is described. The post refers to future intent and preparation, not a completed or interrupted act.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits best. There is an implied desire to die (asking about lethality of saved pills) combined with a specific method (duloxetine pills) and preparation (saving them for later). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' as including ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""I just want to end"" implies a desire to end one's life. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""stop feeling this way,"" ""hell,"" ""If anyone or anything truely cared about my life I know it isn't me. Not anymore,"" ""feel so empire"" (likely empty/emptier), ""out of place."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and self-worth issues.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""I just want to end but haven't yet."" This clarifies that the desire is present, but a concrete action has not been taken.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated as immediate (""tonight,"" ""soon""), but the current desire ""I just want to end"" implies ongoing intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to ""end,"" which in context of the emotional distress, indicates a desire to die or cease to exist.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to end"" in this context clearly expresses a desire to not be alive or to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire ""I just want to end"" is stated as a personal wish, not an unwanted thought. The ""haven't yet"" confirms the desire is present, but action has not been taken.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire (""I just want to end""). The ""haven't yet"" refers to the *absence* of a past initiated action.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No. The phrase ""haven't yet"" explicitly states that such an action has not occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to ""end"" (their life/existence), which goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - The post explicitly states ""haven't yet,"" confirming that no past initiated, potentially lethal action has occurred. This rules out 'Attempt'.

I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""dead by the end of the day today,"" ""off myself,"" ""go buy the gas"" (implying a method like carbon monoxide).
    - Emotional indicators: ""tired,"" ""fatigue,"" ""distract from life."" These suggest a struggle, but the core is suicidal intent.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""go buy the gas"" explicitly mentions a substance/means (""gas"") and a preparatory action to acquire it.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""by the end of the day today"" suggests imminence, though it's framed as something they *could* do if not for fatigue.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" and ""I can't off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas"" clearly indicate a desire for death/suicide, even if action is currently inhibited by fatigue/procrastination.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""off myself"" is explicit.
    - Yes, ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" expresses a clear desire to die.
    - The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions; rather, they state a desire that is currently being prevented by fatigue.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, ""gas"" is mentioned as a specific method/substance. ""Go buy the gas"" is a preparatory step, even if it's currently being procrastinated. The statement implies that if they were to acquire the gas, they would use it for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""I could be dead by the end of the day today"") and a future preparatory step (""go buy the gas"") that is being delayed.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated* potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""dead by the end of the day today,"" ""off myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post also mentions a specific method (""gas"") and a preparatory step (""go buy the gas""), even if the execution is being delayed by procrastination. This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'. The presence of a *conceived plan* with a method pushes it into 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of an *initiated* suicidal act, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

Therefore, the presence of a clear desire to die and a specific method/preparatory step (even if procrastinated) aligns with 'Behavior'.

    - References to past actions: ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to past *expressions* or *thoughts*, not a past suicidal *action*.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""already"" suggests a desire for immediate action, but no specific timeframe like ""tonight.""
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to ""do it"" (commit suicide), overcoming hesitation. This is not expressing distress about *unwanted* thoughts, but rather a desire to act on them.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""do it"" in the context of ""post about suicide constantly"" clearly refers to suicide.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I should stop being a pussy and do it... I should just suck it up and do it already"" expresses a strong personal desire to act on suicidal thoughts.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true. The writer expresses a desire to *act* on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""Do it"" is generic and lacks any specific details.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""I should... do it""). The mention of ""post about suicide constantly"" refers to past *discussion/expression*, not a past *action*.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No. There is no description of an initiated attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator': The post clearly expresses a personal desire to commit suicide (""do it""), not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - Not 'Behavior': While there is clear suicidal intent, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The phrase ""do it"" is too vague to qualify as a plan.
    - Not 'Attempt': No past or very recent initiated suicidal action is described.
    - This post fits 'Ideation' because it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to act on them, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I started to cut my rights leg"" (self-harm, described as coping, not suicidal), ""planned to kill myself in the forest in January"" (past plan, not acted upon), ""end it"" (implies ending life), ""plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"" (explicit suicidal plan with method).
    - Emotional indicators: ""done and happy,"" ""done with everything,"" ""not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time."" The stated happiness is unusual but the ""done with everything"" and clear intent to ""end it"" and ""hang myself"" indicate a desire to die.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: ""planned to kill myself in the forest in January"" (past plan), ""plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest"" (current specific method and location), ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"" (additional self-harm/method), ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"" (explicit preparations and means).
    - References to past actions: ""I started to cut my rights leg"" (past self-harm, not suicidal attempt). ""And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't"" (past plan, explicitly stated as *not* acted upon).
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""now it time to stop the lie and end it."" ""So I plan to hang myself..."" - indicates current and imminent intention.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, current wish to die (""end it,"" ""plan to hang myself"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" (in a past plan) and ""plan to hang myself"" (current plan), and ""end it.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive (""I'm done,"" ""end it"").
    - The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions; rather, they state a clear intention to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""hang myself""), location (""highest tree of the forest""), and tools/means (""the rope, the axe and the car"") are mentioned.
    - Yes, there are clear signs of preparation: ""Everything is ready.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both past events (school struggles, past self-harm, past plan that wasn't acted on) and a current/future intention (""now it time to stop the lie and end it,"" ""So I plan to hang myself"").
    - It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated in the past or very recently. The past plan to kill self was explicitly stated as ""But I didn't."" The self-harm was for calming down, not a suicidal act. The current intention is a plan for the future.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""end it,"" ""plan to hang myself""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - The post explicitly mentions a specific plan, method, and preparations (""hang myself,"" ""highest tree of the forest,"" ""rope, axe, car,"" ""Everything is ready""), which means it goes beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    - The post describes a current, detailed plan and preparations for suicide, but it does *not* describe a past or very recent *initiated action* that was potentially lethal. The past plan was not acted upon. Therefore, it does not fit the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal desire alongside a specific plan, method, and preparations clearly fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""just going to die anyway,"" ""don't really want to die.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""dumbest shit ever,"" ""I wish I was never born,"" ""no point for us being here."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and existential questioning.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not present.
    - Assessed desire: The post expresses a wish to have never been born, which implies a desire for non-existence. However, it immediately and explicitly negates a desire to die: ""but at the same time don't really want to die."" This is a crucial qualifier.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? While ""I wish I was never born"" suggests a desire for non-existence, the direct follow-up ""but at the same time don't really want to die"" negates a current, active desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""don't really want to die"" directly states a lack of desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and existential thoughts.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and existential thoughts about life and death (""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"", ""I wish I was never born"").
    - However, the critical phrase ""but at the same time don't really want to die"" explicitly negates a personal desire to die.
    - This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die...""
    - It does not fit 'Ideation' because there is no clear, current, personal desire to die.
    - It does not fit 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' as there is no plan, method, preparation, or initiated action.

I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: Shame, fear (""afraid""), feeling ""fucked up,"" ""disgusting."" These indicate significant distress but not explicitly suicidal feelings.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: The past action described is buying a ""pocket pussy,"" not a suicidal act.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: No suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is expressing distress about a social situation and asking for advice (""What do I do?""). There is no stated desire to die or not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? No. The core of the post is about shame and fear of social judgment, and a plea for help/advice.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (buying the item), current feelings of shame and fear, and future concerns about starting a new school. No suicidal actions or intentions are described.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress, shame, and fear. It clearly lacks any explicit personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. The user is seeking advice on how to handle a difficult social situation, not expressing a wish to end their life.
    - This rules out 'Ideation' (no explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to die), 'Behavior' (no plan/method/preparation), and 'Attempt' (no past initiated lethal action).
    - The content aligns with the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and sadness without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""kill yourself"" is explicitly used.
    - Emotional indicators: ""selfish,"" ""sick of it,"" ""suffer,"" ""asshole move,"" ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"" indicate strong negative emotions like anger, frustration, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated, but the frustration about being prevented implies a current desire.
    - Assessed desire: The post expresses a clear desire to ""kill yourself"" and frustration about being prevented from doing so (""they don't let you kill yourself. what kind of an asshole move is that? why do you want me to suffer""). This indicates a genuine wish to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill yourself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, the frustration about being prevented from killing oneself strongly implies a desire to do so. The question ""why do you want me to suffer"" also points to a desire for the suffering to end, which is connected to the desire to die in this context.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they are frustrated about being prevented from acting on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire and frustration about being prevented from acting on it.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it explicitly states a desire to ""kill myself"" and expresses frustration about being prevented from doing so, indicating clear personal suicidal intent.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action or attempt, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category, as it clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without detailing a plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""im going to do it"" strongly implies suicide in context, and ""pls fucking end me"" is a direct plea for death.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""lonely,"" ""nobody fucking cares,"" ""Im such a spoiled piece of shit"" indicate despair, feelings of being a burden, and self-loathing.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. ""im going to do it"" is vague and doesn't specify a method or plan.
    *   References to past actions: None.
    *   Imminence: ""before the day"" suggests an immediate desire for death.
    *   Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, explicit personal desire to die (""pls fucking end me"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not verbatim. However, ""im going to do it"" and ""pls fucking end me"" clearly convey a personal desire for death and suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""pls fucking end me before the day"" is a direct and explicit desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; the post expresses a desire to act on these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. ""im going to do it"" is not a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""im going to do it"", ""pls fucking end me before the day"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""pls fucking end me"") and a clear indication of suicidal intent (""im going to do it""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's more than general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a personal desire to die.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (like a specific type of pill, a location, or a tool). The phrase ""im going to do it"" is too vague to be considered a ""plan"" under the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die, but without a specific plan, method, or preparations.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide."" It also expresses a desire for death (""I hope it'll be me next"") in the context of stabbings. The preferred method of death is to be a victim of a stabbing, as opposed to a self-initiated suicide, to avoid family shame.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Shame (""bring shame in the family"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** The post mentions ""stabbing"" as a desired *way* to die, but it's not a self-initiated plan or method. The writer is hoping to be a *victim*, not planning to stab themselves or acquire a tool for self-harm. There are no preparations mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I hope it'll be me next"" indicates a current desire.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear wish to die, and a specific preference for how that death occurs (via an external event like a stabbing) to avoid the social stigma of suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""with a suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hope it'll be me next"" clearly indicates a desire for death.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a clear desire for death.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? A method of death (""stabbing"") is mentioned, but it's not a *self-initiated* method or plan for suicide. The writer is expressing a desire to be a *victim* of an external event, not planning their own action.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire for a future event (""I hope it'll be me next"").
    *   Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I hope it'll be me next"") and explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the context of avoiding shame. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   While a method of death is mentioned (""stabbing""), it is not a *self-initiated plan or method* for suicide. The writer is hoping to be a victim of an external event, not actively planning or preparing to commit suicide themselves. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken."" This post lacks a concrete, self-initiated plan or preparation.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits 'Ideation' because it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, but without a specific, self-initiated plan, method, or preparations for carrying out suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""killmyself,"" ""put an end to it all,"" ""disappear,"" ""kill myself with peace.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money,"" expresses despair, hopelessness, social isolation.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: The user asks ""how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?"" and ""how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it?"". This indicates a desire for a *way to enable* the suicide (disappearing to avoid family knowing), but no specific *method of suicide* (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned. There are no concrete preparations for the *act of suicide itself*.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: Not explicitly stated as immediate, but the desire is strong and current.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""i want to put an end to it all,"" ""so i can just kill myself with peace."" Clear desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killmyself,"" ""put an end to it all.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i want to put an end to it all,"" ""so i can just kill myself with peace.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly personal and present.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific *suicide method* is mentioned. The idea of ""disappearing"" is a condition or a way to avoid discovery, not the method of suicide itself.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The thoughts about ""disappearing,"" ""go to another country,"" ""have another identity"" are thoughts about *enabling* the act by avoiding family knowledge, but not concrete preparations for the *method of suicide* (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). The post is asking *how* to disappear, indicating no current, concrete plan even for that.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""i want to put an end to it all,"" ""so i can just kill myself"").
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""killmyself,"" ""put an end to it all""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is ruled out.
    - The distinction between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' hinges on the presence of a *specific plan, method, or preparations for the act of suicide itself*. While the user expresses a desire to disappear to facilitate the act, no concrete suicide method (e.g., specific pills, a gun, jumping from a specific location) is mentioned, nor are any preparations for the *suicide method* described (e.g., ""I have the pills,"" ""I've written the note""). The post is asking *how* to disappear, indicating a lack of a concrete plan even for that precursor. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Given the lack of a specific suicide method or concrete preparations for the act itself, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states they *wanted* to die and expresses frustration at not succeeding.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag"" is a specific method described for the past attempt and implied for the future attempt. ""another plan in mind"" also indicates a future plan.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The description of the past act (""using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets"") implies preparation. The statement ""I'm gonna try again tonight"" and ""another plan in mind"" indicate ongoing planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        - Past: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag..."" This is a clear description of a *specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated* by the author.
        - Current/Future: ""I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind."" This indicates ongoing and future intent with a plan.
    - Crucially, does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated in the past or very recently, even if it was stopped, interrupted, or failed? Yes, the post explicitly states, ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag... but EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF, I FUCKING BREATHE."" This is a definitive description of an initiated suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation...""). This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death"".
    - Although there is also strong current ideation and future planning (""I'm gonna try again tonight,"" ""another plan in mind""), the presence of a clear description of a past *attempt* takes precedence according to the 'Attempt' definition: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
