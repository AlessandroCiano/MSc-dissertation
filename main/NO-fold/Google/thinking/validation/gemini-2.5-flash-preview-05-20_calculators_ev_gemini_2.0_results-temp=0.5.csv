0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""ending my life again,"" ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Never will find love,"" ""mental breakdown,"" ""everything in my life is crap,"" ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""go to a bridge and jump off"" is a specific location and method.
    - References to past actions: ""ending my life again"" implies past suicidal ideation or desire, but not a specific *initiated action* described in the post. It suggests a recurrence of suicidal thoughts/desires.
    - Imminence: The desire is expressed in the present (""I want to go...""). No specific timeframe like ""tonight"" but it's a current desire for action.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal wish to die and for life to end, expressed through ""ending my life"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""ending my life.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""ending my life,"" ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly personal and not negated.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""go to a bridge and jump off"" explicitly states a location and a method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations (like writing a note or acquiring items) are mentioned, but the statement of intent with a specific method and location is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention (""thinking about ending my life again,"" ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. While ""again"" implies past ideation or consideration, the post does not describe a past *initiated action* (e.g., ""I jumped from a bridge last year,"" ""I took pills yesterday""). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - Not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond mere thoughts or a general desire to die; it includes a specific plan/method (""go to a bridge and jump off"").
    - Not 'Attempt' because it describes a current intention and plan, not a past initiated action. The word ""again"" refers to the recurrence of the *thought* or *desire*, not a past completed *attempt*.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal intent (""ending my life"") combined with a specific method and location (""go to a bridge and jump off"") fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I'm going to die soon."" This is a direct statement about dying.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm inconsolable"" indicates extreme distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""soon"" indicates a future intention with some level of imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: The statement ""I'm going to die soon"" in the context of being ""inconsolable"" strongly implies a personal desire for life to end or a belief in its imminent end due to despair, rather than an unwanted thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""I'm going to die soon"" in this context expresses a clear desire for life to end or a strong belief in its imminent end due to despair.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement is a declaration of an outcome, not a description of an unwanted thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context. The imminence is ""soon,"" and there's a strong desire/belief in dying. However, there is no mention of *how* this will happen, no action, no method, not even a vague one. ""Die soon"" is an outcome, not an action or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""I'm going to die soon"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses profound distress (""inconsolable"") and a clear personal expression of wanting life to end or believing it will end soon (""I'm going to die soon""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned for carrying out the stated intention. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The strong personal desire/belief in dying means it is not merely an 'Indicator'.

Therefore, the post clearly expresses suicidal ideation without a specific plan or action.

    - Emotional indicators: The plea ""Help me... Please somebody help me"" indicates extreme distress and a desperate desire to end life.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly mentions ""barbiturates/Nembutal"" as the desired method. The request ""help me find"" indicates an active step towards acquiring the means, which is a form of preparation/plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""Help me kill myself,"" ""help me find"").
    - It does not describe a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent (""Help me kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - Crucially, it goes beyond mere ideation by specifying a method (""barbiturates/Nembutal"") and actively seeking help to acquire that method (""help me find""). This constitutes a plan/method/preparation.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific method and an active step towards acquiring that method (preparation) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""Is there a painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" These are direct expressions of a desire for death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""struggling,"" ""unmotivated,"" ""feel so sorry for them,"" ""selfish,"" ""can't get off my lazy ass,"" ""world scares me,"" ""fear intimacy,"" ""feel worthless,"" ""tired."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, self-loathing, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post *asks* about a ""painless way to die"" and expresses not knowing ""how to die with certainty and without pain."" This indicates the *absence* of a specific plan, method, or preparation, as the author is seeking this information.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** The desire is present (""I want to sleep forever""), but the lack of a known method or plan reduces immediate imminence of *action*. It's a desire for an outcome, not an immediate plan for action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire to die or for life to end (""Is there a painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever,"" ""how to die with certainty and without pain""). This is not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a personal desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No direct mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""Is there a painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever,"" ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" These phrases clearly convey a desire for death.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite; the writer is actively seeking a way to fulfill this desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The post *inquires* about a method (""painless way to die,"" ""how to die...""), which signifies the *lack* of a chosen or known method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: While there's a strong desire to die, the imminence of *action* is tied to finding a method, not to an immediate action with a chosen one. There is no vague reference to an *action* being taken or planned, only a desire for an outcome and a question about how to achieve it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current desire/intention (""Is there a painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""Is there a painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever""). This is not general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts. Thus, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die and suicidal thoughts, but it *lacks* any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The author is *asking* for a method, indicating they do not have one. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not describe any initiated past action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The inquiry about a method (""Is there a painless way to die"") confirms the *absence* of a specific plan, method, or intended action.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""whats the point of living,"" ""none of it will matter when you're dead,"" ""want to kill myself,"" ""i still want to die,"" ""nothing matters after you die,"" ""life doesnt really matter,"" ""i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways,"" ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves,"" ""none of this matters and we wont remember anything at all after we're dead.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""pointless,"" ""huge waste of time."" The tone is one of existential despair and hopelessness about the meaning of life.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""for a year straight i was constantly thinking about how nothing matters after you die and how life doesnt really matter"" refers to past *thoughts*, not actions. ""all the things that made me want to kill myself are solved"" refers to past *reasons* for ideation, not past actions.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The post is more philosophical and questioning (""whats the point,"" ""why shouldn't we""), but ""i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways"" suggests a current inclination. However, it's not highly imminent like ""tonight"" or ""now.""
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to die (""i still want to die,"" ""i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways"") and a questioning of why one *shouldn't* kill themselves. There is no negation of these thoughts or desires.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""want to kill myself,"" ""kill ourselves,"" ""should do it anyways.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""i still want to die,"" ""whats the point of living,"" ""life is all pointless,"" ""this all just seems like a huge waste of time.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is contemplating the logic of acting on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: The imminence isn't extremely high, and there's no vague reference to action like ""make this pain physical."" The post is a philosophical contemplation of suicide, not a statement of an impending action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past *thoughts* (""for a year straight i was constantly thinking"") and current *feelings/desire* (""i still want to die,"" ""i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No, only past *thoughts* or *reasons* for thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""i still want to die"") and explicit suicidal thoughts (""want to kill myself,"" ""should do it anyways""). This rules out 'Indicator' which is for general distress or *unwanted* suicidal thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The questioning nature (""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"") is a contemplation, not a statement of an intended action with a how-to. This aligns with 'Ideation' and rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal thoughts and desire without a plan or action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it."" The phrase ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" is a strong indicator of an intended self-harm action, especially in the context of wanting to ""be gone"" and ""not survive.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""so much mental pain,"" ""can't handle it,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""I need peace."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No explicit method like ""pills"" or ""gun"" is named. However, ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" implies an intended action to cause physical harm, which in this context (wanting to be gone and not survive tonight) serves as a vague but present indication of a method or intended action.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""tonight,"" ""tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it."" This indicates very high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die/not be alive/for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"": No, not directly.
    *   Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end: Yes. ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it."" This is a very strong and clear desire for life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them: No, the opposite is true. The writer expresses a clear desire to act on these feelings.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied: ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" is a key phrase. When combined with the explicit desire to die (""be gone,"" ""not survive"") and high imminence (""tonight""), this phrase implies an intended action to cause physical harm as a means to end their life. While vague, it moves beyond mere ideation into an intended action. The definition of Behavior includes ""an intended action (even if the method is vague, like 'want to make the pain physical,' especially if coupled with high imminence)."" This fits perfectly.
    *   Are there signs of preparation: No explicit preparations mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""tonight"").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is clear, personal suicidal intent and desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is strong ideation, the phrase ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" coupled with the high imminence and desire to ""be gone tonight"" suggests an intended action or method, even if vague. This moves it beyond pure thought/desire.
    *   **Behavior:** This is the best fit. There is explicit suicidal desire (""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it"") and a clear indication of an intended action/method, even if vague (""I want this pain to turn into physical""), combined with extremely high imminence (""tonight""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' which includes ""an intended action (even if the method is vague, like 'want to make the pain physical,' especially if coupled with high imminence).""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past initiated action is described.

Therefore, the post falls under 'Behavior' due to the strong suicidal intent, high imminence, and the implied intended action (""turn pain into physical"") as a means to achieve the desired outcome of being ""gone.""

    - The definition of 'Indicator' specifically covers this scenario: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die').""
    - This post perfectly fits that description. The author is expressing distress over intrusive thoughts, not a genuine desire to die.
    - It is not 'Ideation' because there is no *personal expression of desire to die*.
    - It is not 'Behavior' because there is no plan, method, or intended action.
    - It is not 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past initiated action.

I dont have anything days are jujst passing me by, im watching through the window and the earth is moving but me? im in the same place, the day and night cycle keeps on going, and going, and going, and im stuck, stagnant. People do things, but why? they study, work, want to go somewhere in life, but where does the desire come from? I have never experienced that, never. Theres no space for me around these parts, no space. I think i have n incurable disease or something is wrong with my brain, i cant even relate to otehr people that want to shoot their heads off like me. Im damaged. I cant feel nothing ive been falling down this void for like 5 or 6 years and i havent cried once, just once. All i know is that i want to call it a day and kill myself for the sake of my family. Ive seen the way they talk about me and while its not malicius or anything like that its obvious they try to not talk about me. I think theyre gonna be better off without me, everyone is going to be better without me. Im too weird, my face is weird, my demeanor is weird. Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant if there was a button i could press that would erase all traces of my existence i wouldnt even doubt it, id go for it. But these things dont exist, so either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids. i dont know, i wouldnt know, im damaged",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""I want to call it a day and kill myself."" It also says, ""Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant."" The author mentions specific methods: ""either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids."" The author also expresses feeling like a burden (""they're gonna be better off without me, everyone is going to be better without me"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""no today, nor tommorrow,"" ""don't have anything,"" ""days are just passing me by,"" ""stuck, stagnant""), anhedonia (""can't feel nothing,"" ""haven't cried once""), self-loathing (""too weird, my face is weird, my demeanor is weird,"" ""Im damaged"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, ""run towards a cop with a knife"" and ""find a dealer with some opioids"" are specific methods and intended actions.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** High imminence: ""want to die now, right now in this instant.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die and end existence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""I want to die.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die and for life to end.
    *   The writer does *not* state that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they express a strong personal desire to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, specific methods/actions are mentioned: ""run towards a cop with a knife"" and ""find a dealer with some opioids."" These are concrete ways the author is considering acting on their suicidal intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current and future intentions (""I want to die now,"" ""either I run... or find..."").
    *   It does *not* describe a past initiated, potentially lethal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""want to die now""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post *also* mentions specific methods and intended actions (""run towards a cop with a knife,"" ""find a dealer with some opioids""). This presence of methods/plans rules out 'Ideation'.
    *   The post describes *future* intended actions/plans, not a past initiated attempt. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not the primary classification.
    *   Based on the explicit desire to die, high imminence, and the mention of specific methods/intended actions, the classification is 'Behavior'.

I'm deteriorating. I just want to get it over with. I'm not alone, but I can't tell anyone either. I refuse to be sent back to a mental hospital against my will. The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrases ""I just want to get it over with"" and ""if I go through with it"" strongly imply a desire to end their life, likely by suicide. There are no specific methods or means mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""It's not working anymore,"" ""deteriorating,"" ""haven't slept in weeks,"" ""all I see and think are people are going to hurt me"" (paranoia, distress), ""I'm deteriorating."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and mental health crisis.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan (e.g., ""I'm going to jump,"" ""I'm going to take pills""), method, or preparations (e.g., ""writing a note,"" ""acquiring means"") are mentioned. The fear is about ""the pain if I go through with it,"" which refers to the act itself, but not *how* it would be done.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I just want to get it over with"" suggests a current, ongoing desire. ""If I go through with it"" indicates active consideration.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for life to end (""I just want to get it over with""). The fear is of the pain associated with the act, not a negation of the desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just want to get it over with"" and the contemplation of ""going through with it"" (referring to ending life) clearly express a desire for life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is present, and the only stated inhibition is the fear of pain, not a lack of desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. ""Go through with it"" implies an action, but there is no indication of *how* that action would be carried out (e.g., ""I'm thinking of pills,"" ""I'm going to the bridge"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While ""go through with it"" implies action, it lacks *any* specific or vague reference to a method or plan. The focus is on the *pain* of the act, not the means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire and future consideration (""if I go through with it"").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire for life to end (""I just want to get it over with"") and active consideration of ending their life (""if I go through with it""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's more than general distress and the desire is personal and not negated.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific means, location, or preparatory actions). The phrase ""go through with it"" implies action but lacks any concrete detail about *how* that action would be taken. This lack of specific plan/method/preparation differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without a specified plan, method, or preparation.

I start reflecting thinking hmm maybe it's me?. But then I realize I push people away unintentionally because I already have the mind frame of they will leave so it's more like ""let's get this over with"". and the ones who are reluctant to stay I don't necessarily give them a reason to. so shucks, I'd leave too. I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No explicit mentions.
    - Emotional indicators: ""fucked up way to feel,"" ""no one sticks around,"" ""everyone leaves you eventually,"" ""I push people away unintentionally,"" ""it starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts."" The most significant emotional indicator is ""I'd leave myself if I could."" This expresses a profound self-rejection and a desire to escape from one's own existence.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: The post discusses past experiences of people leaving, but not past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: No imminence stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I'd leave myself if I could"" indicates a desire to not be who they are, or to escape their current self/existence. This is a strong expression of a desire for life to end or to not be alive, even if not phrased as ""I want to die.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'd leave myself if I could"" strongly implies a desire to escape one's own existence, which is a form of wanting life to end or not wanting to be alive. It's a personal desire, not an abstract thought.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them? No, the desire ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is presented as a personal feeling/wish.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: No high imminence, and no action beyond the desire to ""leave myself.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? The core sentiment ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is a current desire/feeling.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is a clear, personal expression of wanting to escape one's own existence, which falls under the definition of a desire for life to end or not wanting to be alive. This goes beyond general distress and indicates suicidal ideation.
    - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - It is not merely general distress or an unwanted thought; it's a profound personal desire to be gone from oneself. Therefore, it fits 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""i plan to kill myself at 21."" No specific method is mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""not ok,"" ""severely codependent,"" ""can't think for myself,"" ""no sense of self,"" ""constant anxiety, self doubt, and mistrust,"" ""feel really small, like a child,"" ""very unhealthy,"" ""don't know what to do,"" ""no hope,"" ""wish there was a reset button,"" ""braindead,"" ""only getting worse,"" ""constant loneliness,"" ""anhedonic and dissoative,"" ""this is hell."" These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** A specific future plan is stated: ""i plan to kill myself at 21."" The age (21) is a specific timeframe, but no method or preparation is detailed.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The plan is for age 21, which is 3 years from the current age of 18. This is not immediate imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""i plan to kill myself at 21, whether i want to or not"" indicates a perceived inevitability or compulsion rather than a clear desire. However, the *plan* itself is stated as a definite future action, and the overwhelming despair (""no hope,"" ""this is hell"") supports a desire for life to end, even if the individual feels trapped into the decision. It is not an explicit negation of the desire to act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""i plan to kill myself.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, despite the ""whether i want to or not"" nuance, the explicit plan to ""kill myself"" combined with profound hopelessness (""no hope,"" ""this is hell"") indicates a desire for life to end.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No. The ""whether i want to or not"" suggests a feeling of lack of control or inevitability, not a rejection of the thoughts or plan.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** No specific method is mentioned.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence... implies a method or plan?** Imminence is not high (3 years away). However, the post explicitly states a ""plan to kill myself."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** Future intention (""at 21"").
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. It explicitly states ""i plan to kill myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal intent and a desire for life to end. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:**
        *   'Ideation' is characterized by suicidal thoughts/desire *without* a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations.
        *   'Behavior' includes suicidal thoughts/desire *AND* mentions a plan, method, intended action, or preparations.
        *   The post explicitly states, ""i plan to kill myself at 21."" The presence of the word ""plan"" directly aligns with the definition of 'Behavior', even though a specific method is not mentioned and the timeframe is not immediate. The definition for 'Behavior' specifically includes ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide.""
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No past initiated action is described. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit mention of a ""plan to kill myself,"" the classification falls under 'Behavior'.

These clearly indicate hopelessness, despair, and a profound desire to escape suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The user explicitly states they are *not* going to kill themselves soon.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** The user states ""atleast not any time soon"" and ""given myself 5 more years,"" indicating a lack of immediate imminence for action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I want to die"" clearly expresses a desire for life to end. While they negate immediate action, the underlying desire to die or not exist is present.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I am not going to kill myself"".
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to die,"" ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence,"" ""Nobody is getting anything out of this.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon."" This is a negation of *action* in the near future, but not a negation of the *desire* to die or the presence of suicidal thoughts. The primary sentiment is a desire to end suffering, which aligns with ideation.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The explicit statement ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon"" confirms the absence of a current plan or intended action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a future (5 years) consideration of suicide, but explicitly denies immediate action.
    *   It does not describe any past specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator' because the desire to die is explicitly stated and not presented as unwanted thoughts.
    *   However, the post explicitly states ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon"" and gives a timeframe of ""5 more years."" This lack of a plan, method, or immediate intended action, combined with the explicit denial of near-term action, rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal act, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end, but without any specific plan, method, or intended action for carrying it out.

Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide.

    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""I feel like the only way out is suicide."" ""I've considered hanging."" ""I should just make my escape.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** High levels of distress, hopelessness, despair, feeling stuck, overwhelmed, not good enough, crying easily, feeling empty, fear, lack of interest, difficulty forming connections, awkwardness, sensitivity.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I've considered hanging"" is a specific method. No explicit preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past *suicidal actions* are mentioned. The ""considered hanging"" is a past thought/consideration, not an initiated action.
    *   **Imminence:** The user states ""I don't really have the guts to do it"" and ""I can't seem to go through with it,"" which indicates a current barrier to action, but the desire (""only way out is suicide,"" ""make my escape"") and method consideration are current thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide.""

    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   Even though the writer states they lack the ""guts"" to go through with it, the *consideration* of a specific method (""hanging"") moves it beyond mere ideation into the realm of 'Behavior' as per the definition which includes mentioning ""a specific method.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings, thoughts, and considerations.
    *   It does *not* describe a past, initiated, potentially lethal action. The phrase ""I've considered hanging"" describes a thought process, not an attempt. The user explicitly states ""I don't really have the guts to do it"" and ""I can't seem to go through with it,"" confirming no action was initiated.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** There is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""only way out is suicide,"" ""make my escape"").
    *   **Not Attempt:** No past initiated action is described.
    *   **Between Ideation and Behavior:** The post contains explicit suicidal ideation. Crucially, it also mentions a *specific method* (""hanging""). The definition of 'Ideation' states it is ""without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations."" The definition of 'Behavior' states it ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action..."". The mention of ""hanging"" fits the ""specific method"" criterion for 'Behavior', even if the author currently lacks the resolve to act on it. The consideration of a specific method, even if not acted upon, indicates a level of planning or thought process beyond general suicidal thoughts.

    - The post describes a current decision and preparation (""already got my suicidal notes ready"") for a future intention (""i'm going to kill myself"").
    - It does not describe a past initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent and a desire to die (""i already know i'm going to kill myself and i've decided on it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - Crucially, it goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by mentioning a concrete preparation: ""i already got my suicidal notes ready."" This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire AND mentions a plan, method, intended action, or preparations.
    - It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""sick of seeing my face,"" ""tired of having to get dressed and seeing my body,"" ""tired of doing my makeup and seeing my face,"" ""tired of seeing myself in every mirror,"" ""feel so ugly and horrible,"" ""hate everything about myself,"" ""still look disgusting."" These indicate severe distress, self-loathing, and body image issues.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions past attempts to change appearance (""dyed and cut my hair,"" ""started doing more makeup,"" ""got new clothes,"" ""ate less,"" ""ate more""), but not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No stated intentions related to suicide or death. The desire is ""I just wish I could press a button and be someone else.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The primary desire is to ""be someone else,"" indicating a profound dissatisfaction with their current self, rather than an explicit desire to die or for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. The phrase ""I just wish I could press a button and be someone else"" expresses a desire for transformation or escape from their current self, not a desire for non-existence or death. There's no ""I want to die"" or ""I want it to be over.""
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.
    *   **If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned OR the desire is clearly negated/unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'.** This post does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence...** Not applicable, as there is no explicit desire to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** Describes current feelings of self-hatred and past efforts to change appearance. No past or future suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly indicates significant distress, self-loathing, and body image issues.
    *   However, it *lacks* any explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, or for life to end. The wish to ""be someone else"" is a desire for identity change/escape, not a desire for death.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, intended action, or past attempt.
    *   Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category, as it expresses general distress and hopelessness about their self-image without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill themselves"" and ""hurt themselves.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author expresses an opinion (""In my opinion..."") but no personal emotional indicators related to suicide.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None. The author is discussing others' potential actions, not their own.
    *   **References to past actions:** None by the author.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** None by the author.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer is asking a question and expressing an opinion about *other people's* motivations for posting about suicide. There is no personal desire to die or suicidal intent expressed by the author of this post.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, but only in reference to *other people's* posts/actions, not the author's own.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No, not from the author.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as the thoughts are attributed to others, not the author.
    *   Conclusion: No personal suicidal intent from the author.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a general observation and question about *other people's* posts. No personal actions or intentions by the author.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses suicide in a general, abstract, and observational manner, referring to the actions and motivations of *other people* who post about suicide.
    *   There is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts by the author of this post.
    *   The definition for 'Indicator' states: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.**"" This perfectly aligns with the content of the post. The author is discussing suicide abstractly (in the context of online posts) without expressing any personal suicidal intent.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (no personal desire to die), 'Behavior' (no plan/method/action), or 'Attempt' (no past initiated action).

    *   Are there signs of preparation? **No**.
    *   There is no current plan, method, or preparation mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? **Both.**
        *   Current intention/ideation: ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself.""
        *   Past event: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed."" This describes specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions that were initiated by the author in the past. This directly aligns with the definition of an 'Attempt'. The author is linking these past attempts to their current feelings.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong current suicidal ideation (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself,"" ""no point in being alive anymore""). This alone would be 'Ideation'.
    *   However, the post explicitly describes ""past two times ive tried ive failed."" This is a clear statement of past self-initiated actions that were potentially lethal, which is the core definition of 'Attempt'.
    *   The rules state: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" And, ""'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author"".
    *   Therefore, despite the current ideation, the explicit mention of past attempts by the author makes 'Attempt' the correct classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""killing myself"" is explicitly used. The user also states, ""I don't want to be alive.""
    - Emotional indicators: The user expresses a strong desire to not be alive, dismissing external judgment (""couldn't care less,"" ""don't really care""). This indicates a profound sense of hopelessness or detachment.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: No specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""soon"" is given, but the desire is stated in the present tense (""I don't want to be alive"").
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and explicit desire to die/not be alive. This is not presented as an unwanted thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I don't want to be alive.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite; the writer dismisses reasons not to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Imminence is not explicitly high (e.g., ""now,"" ""tonight""), and no action, vague or otherwise, is mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""killing myself"") and a clear desire to not be alive (""I don't want to be alive""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator' as there is clear personal suicidal intent and the thoughts are not stated as unwanted.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits the definition of 'Ideation', as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.

Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""My desire to kill myself has not [died down]."" Mentions ""Killing myself is painful."" Metaphorically expresses a desire for death: ""if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that."" Crucially, states: ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months."" (Specific method: overdose; specific action: attempted; specific timeframe: recent past).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""what reason is there to live,"" ""literally nothing,"" ""shit just gets more fucked up,"" ""Why bother?""), despair, feeling overwhelmed (""hardest I think I may have ever fought,"" ""recoil...hit me in the face even harder,"" ""bullshit I've endured"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No *current* specific plan or preparation for a *future* act is stated. However, there are clear descriptions of *past initiated actions* with a method (""attempted an overdose"").
    *   **References to past actions:** Direct and clear statement: ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months."" This is a key element.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The desire to kill self ""has not"" died down, indicating ongoing ideation. The past attempts are very recent (""within the past two weeks""). The ""incoming train"" metaphor suggests a current, strong desire for an end.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die/end life (""desire to kill myself,"" ""what reason is there to live,"" ""I just want out"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die/end life.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, the desire ""has not"" died down.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   For a *current/future* act, there is no explicit plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The ""incoming train"" is a metaphor for a desired outcome (death), not a concrete plan.
    *   However, for *past actions*, a specific method (""overdose"") and initiated action (""attempted"") are clearly stated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both current ideation (""My desire to kill myself has not [died down]"") and very recent past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months"").
    *   The description of ""attempted an overdose"" is a clear, specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong current suicidal ideation, which would typically point to 'Ideation'.
    *   However, the definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes **past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal...** This includes attempts described as historical... if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    *   The post clearly describes multiple past attempts (""attempted an overdose"") which are recent (""within the past two weeks,"" ""within the past six months"") and are brought up in the context of the author's current profound despair and desire to die.
    *   The IMPORTANT RULES section states: ""**'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author**, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.""
    *   Given the explicit mention of past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions, 'Attempt' is the most accurate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fucking horrified,"" ""keep crying,"" ""panic attacks,"" ""worry,"" ""can't live without estrogen,"" ""too much,"" ""going insane,"" ""so fucking scared."" These indicate high levels of distress, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed. The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" expresses a deep need for something to continue living a desired life, not a desire to end life itself.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No suicidal intentions are stated.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses extreme distress and fear about potential health issues and parental reactions. There is no stated desire to die or for life to end. The distress is about unwanted circumstances and feelings.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" is a statement about a vital need for the quality of their life, not a desire to end their existence.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or signs of preparation are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings of distress and worry. There are no descriptions of past, present, or future suicidal actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, fear, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed (""too much,"" ""going insane"").
    *   It *lacks* any clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" indicates a strong dependency on HRT for their well-being, implying a desire to *continue* living with it, rather than a desire to end life.
    *   There are no mentions of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
    *   This fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and hopelessness about circumstances, but no explicit suicidal intent. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit desire to die or suicidal thoughts expressed.

Now it's time to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""Now it's time to end it"" is a clear expression of suicidal intent. ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" refers to past actions aimed at ending life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""NO hope left,"" ""don't even eat"" (suggests severe despair, hopelessness, financial distress).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: For the current intent (""Now it's time to end it""), no new specific plan or method is detailed. However, the repeated ""I tried"" refers to past *actions* which, in this context, are self-initiated attempts.
    - References to past actions: ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" are explicit references to multiple past self-initiated actions. The context strongly implies these were suicide attempts.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""Now it's time to end it"" indicates high imminence for current intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire for life to end (""NO hope left,"" ""Now it's time to end it"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end it"" is a strong euphemism for ending life in this context.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""NO hope left"" and ""Now it's time to end it"" clearly express this desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses intent to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - For the current intent (""Now it's time to end it""), no specific new method or plan is detailed.
    - However, the repeated phrase ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" describes past *initiated actions*. While the specific method isn't named for these past actions, the word ""tried"" in this context strongly implies attempted suicide. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The repeated ""I tried"" fits this.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes both past events (""So I tried..."") and a current/future intention (""Now it's time to end it"").
    - It explicitly describes *specific, potentially lethal actions* that were initiated by the author in the past: ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" These are presented as concrete, initiated actions by the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation and intent (""NO hope left,"" ""Now it's time to end it""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because it describes past *initiated actions* (""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more""). These are not just thoughts or plans, but actions that were started.
    - The presence of these clearly stated past self-initiated actions, which are implied to be attempts to end life, aligns directly with the definition of 'Attempt'. The rule states that 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present. The historical nature of these ""tries"" does not disqualify it from 'Attempt' as the author brings them up in the context of their current state.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Society doesn't like me,"" ""People bully me,"" ""don't feel comfortable,"" ""something is wrong with me,"" ""lonely,"" ""unconnected with this world,"" ""nothing fills the hole in my heart,"" ""feel like a creature."" These indicate profound distress, isolation, hopelessness, and low self-worth.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""In the pas I tried to hide this with saying 'I am misanthrope'"" refers to a past coping mechanism, not a past suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" indicates ongoing, persistent thoughts. ""Everyday I am trying to survive"" suggests a struggle against these feelings/thoughts, but the primary statement is the presence of the thoughts.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The statement ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" clearly indicates the presence of personal suicidal thoughts. While ""trying to survive"" shows a struggle, it does not explicitly negate the desire or state that the thoughts are unwanted in the sense of ""my brain tells me X, but I don't want to."" It's more like a battle against the thoughts/feelings.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""thinking about suicide everyday.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? The constant thinking about suicide, coupled with the profound despair and feeling ""unconnected with this world,"" strongly implies a desire for an end to the suffering, which is manifested as suicidal ideation.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the phrase ""Everyday I am trying to survive"" indicates a struggle, but it doesn't explicitly negate the *desire* or state that the *thoughts themselves* are unwanted in the way that would classify it as 'Indicator'. The thoughts are presented as a persistent reality.

    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. There is no high imminence or vague action reference.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current, ongoing thoughts and feelings.
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts (""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"") and significant despair. This moves it beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide.
    *   There is no explicit negation of the desire or statement that the thoughts are unwanted in the way that would classify it as 'Indicator'. The struggle to survive is *despite* the thoughts, not a rejection of the thoughts themselves as unwanted intrusions.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for suicide. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits the definition of 'Ideation' due to the explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts without a plan or action.

24,"What's the use. I'm just about 22 and over the past 3 years I've dropped out of college and cut almost all of my friends off. I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family but I've given up in life and spend my time drinking and smoking which has made me gain 25 lbs. Haven't gotten laid in a year and a half. There is no hell so I'm not scared to die. I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April. For some life may end up getting better but  for me it doesn't. Good luck to the rest of you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""What's the use,"" ""given up in life,"" ""not scared to die,"" ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" These strongly indicate suicidal intent and a desire for life to end.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""What's the use,"" ""given up in life,"" ""for me it doesn't [get better]""), despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" This explicitly states a plan, a preparation (note), and a specific future date.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide attempts.
    - Imminence: ""early April"" indicates a specific, near-future timeframe for the stated plan.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""not scared to die,"" ""given up in life"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but the combination of ""not scared to die,"" ""given up in life,"" and ""I have a plan, note and date"" unequivocally expresses a clear desire to die and suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, absolutely.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they state they have a plan and date.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? A specific method is not detailed, but the post explicitly states ""I have a plan.""
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""note"" is explicitly mentioned as a preparation. ""Date which will be in early April"" indicates a specific timeline for the plan's execution.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The statement ""I have a plan, note and date"" is a direct assertion of a plan and preparation, not just a vague reference.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings of despair and a future intention to act (""date which will be in early April"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear, current, personal desire to die and suicidal intent (""given up in life,"" ""not scared to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings by explicitly stating ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" The mention of a ""plan"" and a ""note"" (preparation) and a specific future ""date"" meets the criteria for 'Behavior'. It indicates not just ideation but concrete steps or intentions towards carrying out a suicidal act.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action by the author. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The combination of explicit suicidal intent and the mention of a plan, preparation (note), and a specific future date firmly places this in the 'Behavior' category.

25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care. If it happens it happens. My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""tell them I'm going to kill myself,"" ""actually do go through with it and kill myself."" Mentions ""how many cuts I have all over myself"" (self-harm, but not described as a suicidal *attempt*). Mentions ""end up dead in a gutter one day"" (fatalistic, not an active suicidal intent).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""too much recently,"" ""anger is worse than ever,"" ""rabid dog,"" ""constantly on edge,"" ""ready to explode,"" ""no one would care or miss me,"" ""I don't care."" (Hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, feeling like a burden, anhedonia, anger).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned for the suicidal act. However, the post presents a dichotomy: ""either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself."" The closing statement ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" is a very strong indicator of preparation and imminent intended action, functioning as a farewell.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""how many cuts I have all over myself"" indicates past/current self-harm, but not a past suicidal *attempt*.
    *   **Imminence:** ""recently,"" ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet."" However, the closing ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" implies high imminence for the suicidal option.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die is present (""kill myself""). While there's a debate between seeking help and acting on it, the final statement strongly suggests a leaning towards the suicidal action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire for life to end or to not be alive, expressed as an option to ""kill myself.""
    *   The writer states the thoughts are ""too much,"" implying distress, but not explicitly that they *do not* want to die or act on them. The debate is *whether* to act or seek help, not whether they want the thoughts. The closing statement strongly suggests a personal desire to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, or location is mentioned for the suicidal act.
    *   However, ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" is a significant preparation and farewell statement. It indicates a decision to act and imminent intent, going beyond mere ideation. It's a communicative act that signals an impending action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current overwhelming suicidal thoughts and a future intention (""I'm going to kill myself"" as an option).
    *   The ""last post ever. Goodbye."" indicates a highly imminent future action.
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past is described as an *attempt*. The cuts are self-harm.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** No, because there is clear, personal, and explicit suicidal intent (""I'm going to kill myself""). The thoughts are overwhelming, not explicitly unwanted in the sense of not wanting to die.
    *   **Ideation:** While there is strong ideation, the post contains more than just thoughts/desire.
    *   **Behavior:** The post expresses explicit suicidal intent and a desire to die. Crucially, the closing statement ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" functions as a clear sign of preparation and imminent intended action, a farewell before acting. This elevates it from mere ideation to behavior, as it implies a decision and impending action, even without a specific method being named. The definition of Behavior includes ""preparations being taken"" or ""intended action (even if the method is vague... coupled with high imminence)."" This farewell fits that criteria.
    *   **Attempt:** No, because no past self-initiated potentially lethal action is described as an attempt. The cuts are self-harm.

Therefore, the combination of strong suicidal intent and the ""last post ever. Goodbye."" as a clear sign of preparation and imminent action points to 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""can't kill myself"", ""suicidal"", ""I know a good clif"" (potential method/location for suicide).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Im so tired"", ""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point"" (hopelessness, anhedonia, feeling like a burden, profound sense of worthlessness). ""I just can't commit to it"" (struggle with execution).
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** ""I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there, i just can't commit to it."" This explicitly identifies a specific method/location (""clif"") and assesses its feasibility (""possible to get there""), even if commitment is lacking. No preparations mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** The phrase ""can't kill myself"" and ""can't commit to it"" suggests a current lack of ability or resolve to act, but the ideation and method identification are present. It's not immediate, but the thoughts are active and include a specific means.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""Im so tired i can't kill myself"" implies a desire to die, but a current inability to act on it. ""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point"" strongly indicates a desire for life to end due to profound despair and lack of self-worth. ""I told someone that im suicidal"" explicitly states suicidal ideation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicidal.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end or to not be alive (""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point"").
    *   The writer does *not* state that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they express a struggle with the *ability* to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method/location (""a good clif"") is mentioned.
    *   The post also considers the logistics and feasibility of reaching this method (""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there""). This goes beyond mere ideation and into the realm of contemplating the *how*.
    *   No preparations are mentioned.
    *   Because there is clear intent and a specific method/location has been identified and its feasibility considered, this leans towards 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state of mind and current ideation, including the identification of a potential method.
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not 'Indicator': The post contains clear, personal expressions of suicidal intent (""kill myself,"" ""suicidal,"" profound despair), not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   Not 'Attempt': There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated suicidal action. The author states they *can't* commit, not that they *tried*.
    *   'Ideation' vs. 'Behavior': The post goes beyond simple ideation (""I want to die""). The author has identified a *specific method/location* (""a good clif"") and has considered its feasibility (""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there""). While they state they ""can't commit to it"" *right now*, the identification and consideration of a specific means moves this from pure 'Ideation' to 'Behavior', as it indicates a concrete element of planning or means identification. The presence of a specific method, even if the commitment to act is currently lacking, is a key element of 'Behavior'.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire for things to ""stop"" and the wish to ""never be born"" express a current desire for an end to life/suffering.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire for life to end or for non-existence (""tired of my life,"" ""I just want it all to stop,"" ""I wish I was never born""). This is not presented as unwanted thoughts, but as a genuine desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes. Phrases like ""tired of my life,"" ""I just want it all to stop,"" and ""I wish I was never born"" clearly express a desire for life to cease or for non-existence.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the desire for an end to suffering and life is expressed as a personal wish, not as an unwanted thought.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context.** No, the desire is for things to ""stop"" or to ""never be born,"" which implies an end, but no *action* or *method* is implied.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes current profound feelings and a desire for an end to these feelings/life.
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound despair and a clear personal desire for life to end (""tired of my life,"" ""I just want it all to stop,"" ""I wish I was never born""). This goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it articulates a desire for non-existence/end of life.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for carrying out these feelings. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself."" It also mentions ""go to the funeral,"" implying death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Depressed,"" ""shit show,"" ""fake ass friends,"" ""shitty family."" These indicate strong negative emotions, despair, anger, and feelings of being unsupported.

    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire to ""kill myself,"" stated as a personal intention and a ""fuck you"" to others, not as an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/for life to end (""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them. The desire is personal and intentional.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   Despite the strong intent and implied imminence (""can't wait""), there is no indication of *how* the action would be carried out (no method, no vague action like ""make this pain physical"" that implies a physical act, etc.).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a future intention (""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'. While the intent is strong, the *how* is absent.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""burden,"" ""disappointment,"" ""they hate me,"" ""better off without a person like me,"" ""everything wrong with the world,"" ""My existence screws up everyone's lives,"" ""Nothing."" These indicate profound self-loathing, hopelessness, despair, and feeling like a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I hold the blade"" indicates possession of a specific means and the act of holding it with intent.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" describes a *current or very recent initiated action* (holding the blade with suicidal intent) that was not completed. It's not a past completed attempt, but an initiated action that was self-interrupted.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The language ""I can't even fucking kill my self. I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" implies a very current, active struggle with the act.

    *   Yes, ""I can't even fucking kill my self"" is a direct phrase.
    *   Yes, ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"" expresses a clear desire for life to end.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method/tool (""blade"") is mentioned.
    *   Yes, ""I hold the blade"" indicates an active preparation or initiation of an action.
    *   The explicit desire to die and the high imminence (current action) coupled with the specific method (""blade"") and the description of initiating the action (""hold the blade but can't do it"") strongly point towards an initiated action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current/very recent action: ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it."" This is not a future plan, but a description of an action that was *initiated* by the author (holding the blade with intent to use it for self-harm/suicide) but was *not completed* or was *self-interrupted*.
    *   This fits the definition of 'Attempt': ""describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The phrase ""can't fucking do it"" implies the action was initiated but stopped by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') due to explicit suicidal intent and mention of a method.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because a specific method (""blade"") is mentioned, and an action involving that method (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"") is described as being initiated.
    *   While it describes an action, it's not merely a future 'Behavior' (plan/intended action). It describes an action that was *initiated* but not completed, which directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'. The phrase ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" indicates a self-interrupted potentially lethal action.

    - Emotional indicators: ""depressed 16 year old,"" feeling unaccepted and forced to conform (""stripping yourself of individuality,"" ""catering to the interests of others,"" ""People love plastic, and people love plastic people""). This indicates significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence of intentions: The statement ""how about i die then"" is a current expression of suicidal ideation. While not stating ""tonight"" or ""now,"" it's a direct, present desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to die, expressed directly. It is not framed as unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""how about i die then"" is a direct expression of a desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""how about i die then.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is presented as a direct, albeit rhetorical, proposition.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Is there a strong desire to die with high imminence implying vague action? The desire is strong, but there is no specific action mentioned beyond ""die."" No indication of *how* they would die.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention (""how about i die then"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""how about i die then""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator', as it's not general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out the desire to die. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' due to the explicit personal expression of a desire to die without any accompanying plan, method, or preparation.

32,"There is no hope. All is lost. I have this on my computer wallpaper now. It is my daily reminder that killing myself will happen. It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life. Nothing anyone can do or say can save my life save for someone putting $1,000,000 in my bank account or if I were to win the lottery. When it will happen I am unsure, but I do know that I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023). It is pointless, meaningless, and a waste of energy to even keep trying. At least I DID try.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""killing myself will happen,"" ""taking my own life,"" ""will not live to see my 40th birthday.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""no hope,"" ""All is lost,"" ""pointless, meaningless, and a waste of energy to even keep trying.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned. No specific preparation (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills,"" ""saying goodbye"") is mentioned. The ""computer wallpaper"" serves as a reminder of the *intention*, not a physical preparation for an act.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""At least I DID try"" refers to trying to live, not a past suicide attempt.
    *   **Imminence:** ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life."" ""When it will happen I am unsure, but I do know that I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)."" This indicates a very high certainty of future action, but the specific timing is vague beyond ""before 2023.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die/end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and ""taking my own life.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and for life to end (""no hope,"" ""all is lost,"" ""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life"").
    *   The writer does *not* state these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they are presented as a definite future.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of physical preparation are mentioned. The wallpaper is a mental commitment/reminder, not a preparation for an action.
    *   Despite high intent and certainty, there is no indication of *how* the action will be carried out. The post lacks any element of a plan, method, or intended action beyond the resolve to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a future intention (""will happen,"" ""will be taking,"" ""will not live"").
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** The post contains clear, explicit, and personal expressions of suicidal intent and desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Not Attempt:** There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post expresses profound suicidal ideation with very high certainty and resolve (""100% confirmed""). However, it *lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation*. The definition of 'Behavior' requires some indication of *how* the suicide will be carried out (method, plan, preparations). While the intent is strong, the absence of these elements means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. It is a strong expression of suicidal thoughts and intent without a concrete plan.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""so so tired,"" ""tired of being criticized and unloved,"" ""worse decision I ever made was staying here."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, and regret.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No current specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down."" This describes a past *opportunity* that the author *did not act upon* (""talked myself down""), explicitly stating they *prevented* themselves from acting. It is not a description of an initiated action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself."" This indicates persistent, ongoing suicidal desire.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, strong desire to die and regret for not having died in the past (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself,"" ""The worse decision I ever made was staying here"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die and regret for not having done so.
    *   The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts; rather, they express regret for *not* acting on them in the past and a current desire to do so.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   While there is high imminence in the desire (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself""), there is no indication of *how* this would be done or any specific action beyond the general act of ""killing myself.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past *opportunity* where the author *did not initiate a lethal action* (""I shouldn't have talked myself down""). It also expresses a current, ongoing desire (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").
    *   It *does not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* by the author in the past. The statement ""I shouldn't have talked myself down"" explicitly indicates that an action was *not* taken, despite the opportunity. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit, personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for a suicidal act. The desire to ""go back and kill myself"" is a strong expression of ideation, but lacks the concrete elements required for 'Behavior'.
    *   The post explicitly states that the author *did not* act on a past opportunity (""I shouldn't have talked myself down""). This means no self-initiated potentially lethal action occurred, ruling out 'Attempt'.

Therefore, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without a specific plan, method, or past initiated attempt.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""too weak,"" ""hurt me severely,"" ""stupid ultimatum,"" ""embarrassing myself,"" ""showing how weak I am,"" ""pathetic,"" ""continue to be used."" These indicate significant distress, feelings of helplessness, low self-worth, and being victimized/used.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I tried at first"" (referring to cutting off toxic people), ""I told him last week"" (referring to an ultimatum). These are not suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No suicidal intentions are stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states, ""I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with."" This indicates a desire for improved life circumstances and relationships, not a desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The desire is for things to be ""normal"" and to have friends.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Not applicable, as there is no explicit desire to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes ongoing relationship issues and past attempts to resolve them.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

    *   There are no plans, methods, preparations, or descriptions of past suicidal actions.

35,"Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?. Today's my birthday. I feel hollow. Everyone expects happiness and joy. I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working"" is explicitly stated as metaphorical, though the ""unfortunately"" hints at a deeper desire. The most direct statement is ""I just want to not exist."" This expresses a desire for non-existence.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hollow,"" ""sadness,"" ""nothing but sadness,"" ""hurts so bad,"" ""I hate this,"" ""crying like a fucking sissy,"" ""suffer through this painful middle ground,"" ""suffer in silence,"" ""God I fucking hate myself."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, self-loathing, and emotional pain.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Never have I felt a lasting happiness."" ""This has been a cycle for years."" These refer to a long-standing emotional state, not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence:** No specific temporal indicators like ""tonight"" or ""soon.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I just want to not exist."" This is a clear, personal desire for life to end or for the individual to cease to exist.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No, not in a literal sense. The ""kill myself"" is explicitly metaphorical.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, ""I just want to not exist"" is a clear and strong expression of a desire for life to end or to cease being alive.
    *   **Explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the desire to ""not exist"" is stated as a personal wish, not an unwanted intrusive thought.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** No.
    *   **Signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence...** Imminence is not high, and no action is implied beyond the desire.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Describes a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** Describes current feelings and a current desire (""I just want to not exist"").
    *   **Describes a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear, personal desire to ""not exist,"" along with intense emotional pain, hopelessness, and self-hatred. This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for carrying out the desire to ""not exist.""
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   Based on the clear personal desire for life to end (""I just want to not exist"") without any specific plan or action, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""i just want to put a bullet right through it"" is a specific method/means.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** High imminence of desire to end suffering (""I just want to end it,"" ""i cant take it anymore,"" ""i dont want to be here anymore"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear, explicit desire to die/end life. The phrase ""someone please murder me becasue i dont have the balls to take my own life"" expresses a desire for death, even if they feel incapable of self-initiation, but the preceding ""put a bullet right through it"" is a direct thought of a self-initiated method.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""take my own life,"" ""I just want to end it,"" and ""I just want to die.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and not be alive.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, ""put a bullet right through it"" is a specific method mentioned. While the author states ""i dont have the balls to take my own life,"" the *thought* of the specific method is present and expressed in the context of strong suicidal desire. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action."" The mention of a ""bullet"" constitutes a specific method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current intense feelings and a current/future desire/intention to end life, including a specific method.
    *   It does not describe a past, initiated, potentially lethal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I just want to end it,"" ""I just want to die,"" ""take my own life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post also mentions a specific method: ""put a bullet right through it."" This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' into 'Behavior', as a specific method is identified. Even with the subsequent statement about not having the ""balls"" to act, the specific method is present in the ideation, which aligns with the 'Behavior' definition of mentioning a plan or specific method.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with the mention of a specific method (""put a bullet right through it"") classifies this as 'Behavior'.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""wasn't made for life,"" ""made no progress and have accomplished nothing,"" ""contribute nothing""), despair (""can't keep doing this it's too much,"" ""too painful,"" ""loathe myself,"" ""sad""), burden (""contribute nothing""). Also, fear (""too scared,"" ""don't want to die in pain,"" ""don't want to make my mother sad"") which is a counter-impulse.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I could take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep."" This is a specific method (""pills"") and a specific timing/circumstance (""while everyones asleep"").
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I'm on suicide watch"" implies past concern or intervention, but not a past self-initiated suicidal action by the author. ""been just getting by for almost twenty years"" refers to a general struggle, not a past attempt.
    *   **Imminence:** ""could take a bunch of pills"" suggests a potential, near-future action. However, ""too scared"" and ""don't want to die in pain"" indicate hesitation.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for life to end (""wasn't made for life,"" ""better if i was dead,"" ""wish i could just fucking end it""). The fear expressed is about the *pain* or *impact on others*, not a negation of the desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""suicide watch,"" ""wish i could just fucking end it"" are explicit.
    *   Yes, ""wasn't made for life,"" ""better if i was dead,"" ""wish i could just fucking end it"" clearly express a desire for life to end.
    *   The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. The fear is about the *method* or *consequences*, not about the desire to die itself.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""take a bunch of pills.""
    *   No explicit preparations (like notes, acquiring means) are mentioned beyond the thought of the timing.
    *   The explicit desire to die is present, and a specific method is mentioned. Even with hesitation, the mention of a specific method moves it beyond mere ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a *potential future action* (""I could take a bunch of pills"").
    *   It does *not* describe a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action by the author. ""I'm on suicide watch"" is a status, not a description of an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear, personal suicidal intent and desire to die (""wish i could just fucking end it,"" ""better if i was dead"").
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past initiated action is described. The post talks about a *potential* action, not a completed or interrupted one.
    *   It's between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and desire (Ideation). However, it *also* mentions a specific method (""take a bunch of pills""). The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action."" The mention of ""take a bunch of pills"" fits the ""specific method"" criterion for 'Behavior', even if the author expresses hesitation about acting on it. The presence of a concrete method being considered, alongside the strong desire to die, classifies it as 'Behavior'.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

And later, ""how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets)."" This describes a self-initiated, potentially lethal action by the author in the past.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** For the *author*, there is no current imminence. For the *friend*, it's ""at some point in the near future (could be days).""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The *author* explicitly states they are *not* currently suicidal and are in a good place. They are discussing their past attempt and their friend's current situation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, for the author's past and the friend's current state.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die...? No, not from the *author* currently. The author is describing their past attempt and their friend's situation.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, the author states they ""haven't had suicidal ideation in months"" and are ""in a good place now.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   For the *author*: A ""plan"" is mentioned in the context of their *past* attempt, but it's not a current plan or method.
    *   For the *friend*: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned by the author.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event for the *author* (""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009""). It describes a current/future intention for the *friend*.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes, ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" This is a clear description of a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action by the author. The author brings this up to provide perspective to their friend, linking the past action to their current efforts to help.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The classification is for the person *writing the post*.
    *   The author explicitly states they are not currently experiencing suicidal ideation and are in a good place. This rules out 'Indicator' (for current state), 'Ideation', and 'Behavior' as current risk categories for the author.
    *   However, the author explicitly describes a ""very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded"" and states they ""faltered in my plan."" This clearly fits the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" The author brings up this past attempt to explain their perspective to their struggling friend.
    *   Therefore, despite the author's current well-being, the explicit mention of a past initiated suicidal action by the author places the post in the 'Attempt' category.

39,"I'm scared therapy wont work. My parents realized 'omg hey our kid isn't really doing all that well' and now I'm going to therapy. Which is good. But I worry therapy won't work. Even on days where I'm actually happy I still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts. And it's tempting a lot of the time. I'm tired of always being afraid and upset over little things, I'm tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation. I wish I could be so much better than I am so I didn't live every moment in shame. Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" is a clear, albeit euphemistic, reference to suicidal thoughts/suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared therapy wont work,"" ""worry therapy won't work,"" ""tired of always being afraid and upset,"" ""tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation,"" ""live every moment in shame,"" ""scared the help won't help me."" These indicate significant distress, self-loathing, hopelessness about improvement, and a desire for their current painful state to end.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""And it's tempting a lot of the time."" This indicates ongoing temptation, not an immediate or specific plan for action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer states that the ""kermit sewer slide"" thoughts are ""tempting a lot of the time."" This indicates a personal desire or pull towards suicide, not that the thoughts are unwanted or intrusive in the sense of ""my brain says X but I don't want to."" The surrounding context of deep unhappiness and shame reinforces a desire for their current life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" is a direct, albeit slang, reference to suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, the phrase ""it's tempting a lot of the time"" in relation to suicidal thoughts, combined with the profound distress and shame (""tired of always being afraid and upset,"" ""tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation,"" ""live every moment in shame""), clearly implies a desire for their current life/suffering to end, which is linked to suicidal ideation.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No. The statement ""And it's tempting a lot of the time"" indicates a personal pull or desire, not an explicit rejection of the thoughts or actions. While they are scared therapy won't work, this fear is about failing to overcome the temptation, not about the thoughts themselves being unwanted.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context.** Imminence is not high (""a lot of the time"" indicates ongoing temptation, not immediate action). There is no vague reference to action beyond the thoughts themselves.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes current/ongoing suicidal thoughts and temptation.
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"") and a clear personal desire/temptation (""it's tempting a lot of the time""). This rules out 'Indicator' because there is a clear personal expression of suicidal desire/temptation, and the thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire/temptation to act on them, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation.

40,"I hate myself so much. Overall I'm terrible. And I know I'm objective because there are some good things about me, I have a few talents and positive traits. But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good but I'm a coward and don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""I hate being alive,"" ""makes me want to kill myself,"" ""I want to kill myself so badly,"" ""people who want to die can,"" ""if I did kill myself,"" ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"" A specific method is mentioned: ""jump in front of a train.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** High levels of self-loathing, hopelessness, despair (""I hate myself so much,"" ""I'm terrible,"" ""awful,"" ""shouldn't exist,"" ""disgusting and pathetic,"" ""sad and stupid,"" ""wish I was never born,"" ""hate everything,"" ""humiliates me so deeply,"" ""fucked in the head,"" ""want to crawl out of my skin"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method is stated: ""jump in front of a train."" There's also a mention of ""end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" which indicates consideration of practical preparations, even if these are currently obstacles.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** The desire to ""go thru with it"" is current, and the mention of being a ""coward"" suggests a current struggle with acting on the desire. ""It's looking pretty good"" implies a current inclination.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a very clear and strong personal desire to die and to act on suicidal thoughts. This is not about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" multiple times and expresses a clear desire to die (""I hate being alive,"" ""I want to kill myself so badly"").
    *   The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions; the desire is clearly personal and present.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""jump in front of a train.""
    *   Signs of preparation are implied by the discussion of ""end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc),"" indicating thought about the practicalities of suicide, even if they are currently obstacles.
    *   The explicit desire to die combined with a specific method and contemplation of practicalities strongly points to 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and future intentions/desires (""I want to kill myself,"" ""I wish I had the guts to jump,"" ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"").
    *   It does not describe a past, specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author. The phrase ""I wish I had the guts"" clearly indicates a desire for a future action, not a description of a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, it goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""jump in front of a train"") and contemplating practical ""end of life stuff."" This moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category due to the clear suicidal intent combined with a specific method and considerations of preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: ""I want to kill myself"", ""everyone would be better off with me dead"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""Fuck me"" (repeatedly, indicating extreme self-loathing, distress), ""i cant breathe"", ""im useless"", ""everyone would be better off with me dead"" (feeling like a burden, hopelessness).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The statement ""I want to kill myself"" is a current desire, but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or action is indicated.
    - Stated desire: There is a clear, explicit desire to die and for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I want to kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to kill myself,"" ""everyone would be better off with me dead.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly stated as personal and current.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Is there a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical"") implying a method or plan in context of high imminence? No, the post focuses on the desire and emotional state, not an action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to kill myself,"" ""everyone would be better off with me dead""). This clearly rules out 'Indicator' as there is a direct personal desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, based on the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts and desire to die without any plan or action, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

42,"confinement mental break down. i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it. i am growing more depressed and feeling more alone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""slitting my wrists"" (specific method of self-harm/suicide).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" ""feeling more alone.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states ""i thought about slitting my wrists today."" This indicates a thought involving a specific method. However, it explicitly states ""but i didnt do it,"" meaning no action was taken, no plan was formed, and no preparations were made.
    *   **References to past actions:** The phrase ""i thought about... but i didnt do it"" describes a past thought process, not an initiated action.
    *   **Imminence:** The thought occurred ""today.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The post expresses significant distress and a specific suicidal thought. While it states the action wasn't taken, it doesn't explicitly state the thought was unwanted or that the writer doesn't want to die. The presence of the thought itself, in the context of distress, indicates suicidal ideation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""slitting my wrists"" is a direct and specific suicidal thought.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? The context of ""mental break down,"" ""depressed,"" and ""alone"" combined with the thought of ""slitting my wrists"" strongly implies a desire to end the suffering, which is characteristic of suicidal intent.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The post states ""but i didnt do it,"" which means the action was not performed. It does not explicitly state that the *thought* itself was unwanted or that the writer *does not want to die*. The presence of the thought is clear.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The key here is that the method is mentioned as a *thought* (""i thought about""), and the action was *not* taken (""but i didnt do it""). This means there is no plan, no intended action, and no preparation. The mention of the method is part of the ideation, not a step towards behavior.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a thought that occurred ""today.""
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, it explicitly states ""i didnt do it."" Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** The post goes beyond general distress. It includes a specific suicidal thought (""slitting my wrists""). It does not explicitly state the thought is unwanted or that the writer doesn't want to die, only that the action wasn't taken. Thus, it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a personal suicidal thought, including a specific method. However, it explicitly states ""but i didnt do it,"" indicating that no plan was formed, no action was intended, and no preparations were made. This fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out."" The mention of a method as a *thought* is still part of ideation if no action or plan is present.
    *   **Behavior:** For 'Behavior', there needs to be a plan, an intended action, or preparations. While a method was thought about, the post explicitly denies any action or plan (""i didnt do it""). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Attempt:** The post explicitly states ""i didnt do it,"" meaning no action was initiated. Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.

The presence of a specific suicidal thought (""slitting my wrists"") but the explicit statement that the action was not taken (""but i didnt do it"") places this squarely in 'Ideation'.

I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""the suicidal feelings are coming back.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""not fun anymore,"" ""worried,"" ""ashamed,"" ""depressed,"" ""paying the price,"" ""constant pain,"" ""hurts to eat."" These are general distress and pain, but the ""suicidal feelings"" are the key indicator for risk.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""when I was more depressed"" and ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" imply past depression and past suicidal feelings, but no past *actions* or attempts.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""coming back"" indicates a current resurgence of these feelings, but no immediate intent to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" indicates the presence of personal suicidal thoughts/desires. There is no statement that these feelings are unwanted or that the author does not want to act on them.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal feelings.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? ""Suicidal feelings"" inherently implies a desire to die or end life, or at least active thoughts about it. There is no explicit negation of this desire.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. The post states they are ""coming back,"" implying they are present without any stated resistance to them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current re-emergence of ""suicidal feelings.""
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. It mentions past depression and past suicidal feelings, but no past *attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly states ""suicidal feelings are coming back."" This is a direct, personal expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings. It is not merely general distress, nor are the thoughts explicitly stated as unwanted. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The explicit mention of ""suicidal feelings"" goes beyond the scope of 'Indicator', which is for general distress or *unwanted* suicidal thoughts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""suicide notes,"" ""leaving soon,"" ""goodbye letters.""
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, finality (""My minds made up"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is asking for help on ""how to write good suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters."" This is a direct mention of preparation for a suicidal act. ""I'm leaving soon"" indicates imminence.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I'm leaving soon"" indicates high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""My minds made up"" is a very strong and explicit statement of suicidal intent and desire to die. The phrase ""Don't say please don't go. Stay."" reinforces this unwavering intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide notes.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'm leaving soon,"" ""My minds made up.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; the writer is seeking help to facilitate the act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Not a specific method of death, but the act of ""writing suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters"" is a clear and explicit form of **preparation** for a suicidal act.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""writing suicide notes,"" ""goodbye letters.""
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Here, the desire is explicit, imminence is high (""leaving soon""), and the preparation (notes) is concrete.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""I'm leaving soon,"" ""need help on the goodbye letters"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator': Ruled out. There is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and preparation.
    - 'Ideation': Ruled out. While there is ideation, there is also clear mention of preparation (""writing suicide notes,"" ""goodbye letters"") and high imminence (""leaving soon,"" ""my minds made up""). This goes beyond just thoughts or desire.
    - 'Behavior': This fits perfectly. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent (""My minds made up,"" ""I'm leaving soon"") AND mentions specific preparations being taken (""how to write good suicide notes,"" ""goodbye letters""). The act of writing suicide notes is a concrete step in preparation for a suicidal act.
    - 'Attempt': Ruled out. No past initiated action is described.

Based on the analysis, the presence of explicit suicidal intent (""My minds made up,"" ""I'm leaving soon"") combined with concrete preparations (""writing suicide notes,"" ""goodbye letters"") clearly places this post in the 'Behavior' category.

This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it (doubt ill make it that long). currently waiting to see my psychiatrist who I don't trust anymore as I TRuST NOT 1 SINGLE soul in this entire world anymore because of long history of trauma/ptsd and shit but then bc of trauma from a few days ago that literally I told all the 'professionals' about and they didn't care btw it was them fucking me over (cops physically and verbally abused me, and I told the hospital staff and they didn't care and just watched them continue to do it and took part in some stuff too) I'm fucking done. only reason I didn't die last night was bc I actually wanna live if I could get the help I need right now but bc of my city and it's healthcare system and workers and how they view me bc of how much I struggle with sh/suicidality they just treat me like shit or are done with me. I just hoped I could get some comfort if there was any left with my psych before I end thing v v soon. save some flowers for me please? I like lavender",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""suicide date,"" ""didn't die last night,"" ""end thing v v soon,"" ""sh/suicidality."" Also, ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" directly refers to past suicidal actions.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""worst of this hell,"" ""don't trust anymore,"" ""TRuST NOT 1 SINGLE soul,"" ""fucking done,"" ""struggle with sh/suicidality,"" ""treat me like shit or are done with me."" High levels of despair, hopelessness, and distrust.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it (doubt ill make it that long)."" This is a specific date/deadline. ""save some flowers for me please? I like lavender"" is a clear farewell/preparation element.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""8 yrs of constant attempts but obv I wasn't trying hard enough."" This is a direct statement of past self-initiated suicidal actions. ""only reason I didn't die last night"" implies a very recent near-action or strong intent.
    *   **Imminence:** ""This Friday, May 14, 2021,"" ""before it (doubt ill make it that long),"" ""end thing v v soon."" Very high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to end things (""fucking done,"" ""end thing v v soon""). There's a conditional desire to live (""only reason I didn't die last night was bc I actually wanna live if I could get the help I need right now""), but the context strongly indicates this condition is not being met, leading to the firm decision to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon,"" ""didn't die last night."" Clear explicit intent to die.
    *   The conditional desire to live is presented as unmet, reinforcing the primary intent to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific *date* for suicide is mentioned (""This Friday, May 14, 2021""). While not a method, it's a critical planning element.
    *   ""save some flowers for me please? I like lavender"" is a clear sign of preparation/farewell.
    *   These elements strongly indicate 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past actions (""8 yrs of constant attempts,"" ""didn't die last night"") and current/future intentions (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon"").
    *   It explicitly describes past, specific, potentially lethal actions initiated by the author: ""8 yrs of constant attempts."" This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong elements of 'Ideation' (clear desire to die) and 'Behavior' (specific date, farewell message).
    *   However, the post also explicitly states ""8 yrs of constant attempts."" According to the definition of 'Attempt', this describes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal."" The rule states: ""**'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author**, even if current ideation/behavior is also present."" The author brings up these past attempts in the context of their current struggles and intent, making it relevant for classification.

Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification due to the explicit mention of past suicide attempts by the author.

47,"Pointlessness. I know someone's gonna hit me with ""well if everything's pointless, then it doesn't matter if nothing matters"". Which doesn't make things better. It doesn't make me want to go rogue and have fun with life because I've let everything go, and come what may until in my grave I lay. No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey. I don't want to look on the bright-side, to have confidence or assertiveness. I am bad at both those things. If I was good at them, I wouldn't want them. That's my point. If we have an option as humans to be any way we want, I vote we be no way at all. I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds. I am so sick of appearances. People care SO MUCH about how other people are. It's sickening. I should start being rude to people, in line with how I feel about us. I know there's a heaven and it distresses me. I want to disappear forever and I know God won't let that happen. I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit. What's difficult is the pain caused to people I care about and who care about me, but I don't really think it'll matter one way or the other. They'll suffer and that will be that, different and worse than had they not suffered, but just another experience at the end of the day.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""until in my grave I lay"" - general reference to death.
        *   ""I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds."" - Expresses a desire to cease to exist, to disappear.
        *   ""I want to disappear forever"" - Direct expression of a desire to not exist.
        *   ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit."" - A clear statement of an intention or belief about their own death by a specific age, implying self-termination.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Pointlessness,"" ""sick of everybody's fascination,"" ""sick of appearances,"" ""sickening,"" ""distresses me,"" ""pain caused to people I care about."" Indicates profound despair, nihilism, anhedonia, and a sense of being a burden/causing suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquiring means.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I know I will die by 35"" is a future intention/prediction, not immediate (13 years away). ""I want to disappear forever"" is a general desire.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to ""disappear forever,"" ""be no way at all,"" and a stated conviction ""I know I will die by 35."" This is a genuine wish for life to end or for them to cease to exist.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No, not explicitly.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes. ""I want to disappear forever"" and ""I know I will die by 35"" strongly convey a desire for life to end or for them to cease to exist. The phrasing ""I know I will die by 35... that is my outer limit"" implies a self-determined end.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the desire to disappear/die is presented as their own wish/conviction, not as unwanted thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** No. There is no mention of *how* they will die by 35 or *how* they will disappear.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence... implies a method or plan?** The imminence is not high (""by 35""). There is no vague reference to action that implies a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** Primarily current feelings and desires (""I want to disappear"") and a future intention/prediction (""I know I will die by 35"").
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, personal expressions of wanting to disappear, not exist, and a self-determined end to life (""I know I will die by 35""). These are not presented as unwanted thoughts but as the author's genuine desire/belief. This goes beyond general distress and fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out the desire to disappear or die by 35. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of a desire for life to end/to not exist, not merely abstract discussion or unwanted thoughts.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""kill yourself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""taking these pills,"" ""die."" Explicitly discusses methods and their potential effectiveness/failure.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Shits difficult"" - expresses frustration and difficulty in achieving the desired outcome (death).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Discusses ""hanging myself"" (method, with implied locations like shower/door frame) and ""taking these pills"" (method, substance). This is an active consideration of *how* to die.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""I'm trying to die"" indicates a current state of actively seeking death, though no specific timeline like ""tonight"" is given. The discussion of methods is current.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to ""die"" and ""kill myself."" Explicitly states ""I'm trying to die not end up brain damaged."" This is a genuine, active wish to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill yourself,"" ""I'm trying to die.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'm trying to die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states a desire to die and is actively contemplating methods.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""hanging myself"" (method, with implied locations like shower/door frame) and ""taking these pills"" (method, substance). The post is evaluating these methods.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills""), but the detailed discussion and evaluation of specific methods for suicide clearly indicate moving beyond mere ideation to considering *how* to act.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The desire to die is explicit (""I'm trying to die""), and the post is actively discussing and evaluating specific methods for suicide. This goes beyond just thoughts; it's a consideration of means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current contemplation and future intention (""I'm trying to die,"" ""idk if hanging myself would even work,"" ""idk if taking these pills would work"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - Not 'Ideation' because the post goes beyond just expressing suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. It explicitly discusses and evaluates specific *methods* (""hanging myself,"" ""taking these pills"") for carrying out suicide. This indicates a consideration of a plan/method.
    - Not 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated action.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal intent (""I'm trying to die"") coupled with the discussion and evaluation of specific methods (""hanging myself,"" ""taking these pills"") for suicide fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The user is actively considering and assessing *how* to die.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""I want to die"", ""killing myself"". No specific method is mentioned; in fact, the user explicitly states ""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Everything is so much effort"", ""fucking depressed and numb and sick of everything"", ""scared of messing it up"", ""can't even think straight anymore"". These indicate severe depression, hopelessness, anhedonia, and fear.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Explicitly states ""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"". Also states ""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up,"" which indicates a lack of immediate intent to act due to a barrier (fear).
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** Low imminence of action due to fear and lack of plan (""probably not gonna do anything""). The user is also considering seeking help (""thinking about admitting myself?"", ""know its safe and maybe I need that right now?"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I want to die"" is a clear desire for life to end. This is a personal desire, not an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""I want to die"" and ""killing myself"".
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die.
    *   The thoughts are not stated as unwanted; the *action* is stated as unlikely due to fear (""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up""). The desire to die is present.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself.""
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    *   No signs of preparation.
    *   Given the explicit statement of no plan and low imminence of action, there is no indication of a plan/method/intended action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and thoughts, and a consideration of future action (seeking help).
    *   There is no description of a past specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I want to die"") and mentions suicide directly (""killing myself""). This rules out 'Indicator', as 'Indicator' is for general distress or explicitly unwanted suicidal thoughts.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"" and ""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up."" This lack of a plan, method, or intended action, despite the presence of suicidal thoughts, rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods: ""count my pills,"" ""take them all"" (implying overdose). The phrase ""why i didnt take them all"" expresses regret for not having committed suicide via overdose.
    - Emotional indicators: ""coward"" (self-loathing), ""nobody loves or cares for me in"" (hopelessness, feeling like a burden, despair).
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""every night i count my pills"" is a clear preparatory action involving a specific method (pills). ""take them all"" is the intended action.
    - References to past actions: ""why i didnt take them all"" refers to a past opportunity or consideration of the action, but explicitly states the action was *not* taken. It's not a past initiated attempt.
    - Imminence: ""every night,"" ""every day"" indicates ongoing, recurring engagement with the means and the suicidal thoughts. The regret for not acting (""why i didnt take them all"") suggests a current desire to have done so.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to have died (""wonder why i didnt take them all"") and self-criticism for not having done so (""why am i such a coward""). This is a genuine wish for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" clearly expresses a desire to have died by overdose. ""living a life nobody loves or cares for me in"" provides the context for this desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; the writer expresses regret for *not* acting.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""pills"" and ""take them all"" clearly indicate an overdose method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""every night i count my pills"" is a recurring preparatory action, demonstrating engagement with the means.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The explicit desire to die is present, and the action of ""counting pills"" is a direct engagement with the specific method, indicating preparation and a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a recurring current/future intention (""every night i count my pills"") and a past regret about *not* having acted (""why i didnt take them all"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The phrase ""why i didnt take them all"" explicitly states that the action was *not* taken. Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator': There is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - Not 'Ideation' (solely): While there is strong ideation (""wonder why i didnt take them all,"" ""life nobody loves or cares for me in""), there is also a specific method (""pills"") and a recurring preparatory action (""every night i count my pills""). This goes beyond thoughts into engagement with means.
    - Fits 'Behavior': The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a specific method (pills/overdose) along with a recurring preparatory action (""counting pills"") related to that method.
    - Not 'Attempt': The post explicitly states the action was *not* taken (""why i didnt take them all""). It describes regret for not attempting, not an actual initiated attempt.

Based on the analysis, the presence of a specific method (pills) and a recurring preparatory action (counting them) combined with a clear desire to die points to 'Behavior'.

I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** No explicit mention of these terms.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""unbearably strong"" (referring to thoughts), ""major downward spiral,"" ""struggle"" (to make it through the day), ""don't know what to do."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and difficulty coping.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""end up in the psych ward again."" This indicates a past hospitalization for mental health reasons, implying a history of severe distress or crisis, which could include suicidal ideation, but it is not a description of a past suicide attempt.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""lately,"" ""past few months,"" ""Everyday."" This indicates ongoing and current distress, but no immediate suicidal intent is stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The post describes ""thoughts"" that are ""unbearably strong"" and a ""major downward spiral."" While it doesn't explicitly say ""I want to die,"" the intensity of these ""thoughts"" coupled with the struggle to live ""Everyday"" and the fear of returning to a ""psych ward"" (often associated with suicidal crises) strongly implies that these ""thoughts"" are suicidal in nature. The desire is for the struggle to end, which is a form of wanting life to end or not be alive.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Not explicitly with phrases like ""I want to die."" However, the description of ""unbearably strong"" thoughts and a ""major downward spiral"" where ""Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle"" strongly implies a desire for this suffering to end, which aligns with wanting life to end. The fear of ""psych ward again"" suggests these thoughts are severe enough to warrant hospitalization, often indicative of suicidal ideation. The thoughts are not explicitly stated as ""unwanted"" in the sense of ""I don't want to die,"" but rather the *consequence* of revealing them (psych ward) is unwanted. This leans towards personal suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current and ongoing state (""lately,"" ""past few months,"" ""Everyday"").
    *   It does not describe a past, specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author. ""End up in the psych ward again"" refers to a past consequence or intervention, not a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) by describing ""unbearably strong thoughts"" and a ""major downward spiral"" that makes daily life a ""struggle,"" implying severe personal suicidal ideation, even without using the explicit word ""suicide."" The context of fearing a ""psych ward again"" reinforces the severity and likely nature of these thoughts. It does not explicitly negate the desire to die. Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' definition of ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end.""
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on this analysis, the post clearly indicates current, strong, personal suicidal thoughts without a plan or past attempt.

    - Emotional indicators: ""can't keep living with depression,"" ""don't want to ruin my mum's mental state,"" ""can't continue to live for decades to come."" These show profound despair, hopelessness, and a desire for life to end.

    - Yes, ""off myself"" is a direct phrase.
    - Yes, ""don't want to live anymore"" and ""can't continue to live for decades to come"" express a clear desire for life to end.
    - No, the writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. The desire is present, with a stated internal conflict regarding the impact on others.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - While ""off myself"" implies an action, it lacks any detail about *how* or *with what*. Without any indication of a method, even vague, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current desire and future intention (""can't continue to live for decades to come"").
    - No past initiated suicidal action is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to not be alive (""don't want to live anymore,"" ""off myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal intent without a specific plan or method.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""just killing myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""mentally ill,"" ""can't afford treatment,"" ""can't hold work,"" ""don't have energy,"" ""health is shit,"" ""what's the fucking point in any of this,"" ""fed up of all this bullshit."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, location), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""just killing myself"" is a general statement of intent, not a method.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""i know that i'm going to end up getting fed up of all this bullshit and just killing myself because what's the point in not."" This indicates a future, conditional intention (""going to end up getting fed up""), rather than an immediate plan. It's a strong statement of perceived inevitability.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""what's the fucking point in any of this,"" and the conviction ""i know that i'm going to end up... just killing myself because what's the point in not."" This clearly expresses a genuine desire for life to end or a strong conviction that they will eventually act on suicidal thoughts due to their circumstances. It is not expressing distress about *unwanted* thoughts; it's a statement of potential future action driven by despair.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""what's the fucking point in any of this"" and the statement ""i know that i'm going to end up... just killing myself because what's the point in not"" clearly indicate a desire for life to end and a lack of perceived purpose in continuing.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite. The phrase ""what's the point in not"" implies a rationale for acting on it.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. The phrase ""just killing myself"" is general and does not specify a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. The imminence is not high (""going to end up getting fed up...""). It's a prediction of a future state, not an immediate action with a vague method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention/prediction: ""i know that i'm going to end up... and just killing myself.""
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""killing myself"") and a desire for life to end (""what's the fucking point,"" ""what's the point in not""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's a clear personal desire, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   The post *lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation* for carrying out suicide. The statement ""i know that i'm going to end up... just killing myself"" is a strong statement of future intent/prediction, but it does not specify *how* or *when* in a concrete way that would qualify as a plan or intended action for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan, method, or preparation.

55,"""You look like you're about to die"". Yeah no shit mom, Iam depressed af and tried to kms yesterday, what do you want from me?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods: ""tried to kms yesterday"" (kms = kill myself). This is a direct reference to a suicidal act. ""You look like you're about to die"" is a quote from someone else, not the author's direct intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Iam depressed af"".
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: The phrase ""tried to kms"" indicates an initiated action, even if the specific method isn't detailed. It's not a future plan, but a past action.
    - References to past actions: ""tried to kms yesterday"" explicitly states a past, self-initiated suicidal action.
    - Imminence: ""yesterday"" indicates this action was very recent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The past action and ""depressed af"" imply a desire to die, but the core element is the described action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""tried to kms"" is an explicit mention of a suicidal act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - This post describes a *past initiated action* (""tried to kms""), not a current or future plan, method, or preparation. While it doesn't detail the method, the phrase ""tried to kms"" itself implies an action was taken.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past event: ""tried to kms yesterday"". This is a specific, self-initiated action that was potentially lethal. This directly aligns with the definition of an 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly states that the author ""tried to kms yesterday"". This is a description of a past, self-initiated action that was potentially lethal. This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... (e.g., 'I tried to hang myself today but I stopped right before passing out')."" The recency (""yesterday"") further reinforces this.

To the point that I question if I did something horrific in a previous life and it was so bad that I'm still paying for it in this life. I cant. Please. I cant live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" clearly implies finding a way to end life. ""I can't live anymore"" is a direct statement of wanting life to end.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I can't. I absolutely cannot fight anymore,"" ""non stop pain and suffering,"" ""Please."" These indicate extreme despair, hopelessness, and exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned. ""non painful way to do this"" expresses a *desire* for a method, but not a specific one.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""This has been non stop for 28 years"" refers to chronic pain/suffering, not a past suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** ""I can't live anymore"" suggests a strong, current desire, but no explicit immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and strong stated desire for life to end (""I can't live anymore,"" ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   However, it expresses a clear and strong desire for life to end: ""I can't live anymore"" and the search for ""a non painful way to do this."" This is a clear desire to die/not be alive.
    *   The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; they are presented as their current, personal desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned. The phrase ""non painful way to do this"" indicates a *search* for a method, not the identification or decision on one.
    *   No signs of preparation are present.
    *   While intent is high, the absence of *any* specific method, even vague, prevents classification as 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state of despair and a current/future intention to find a way to end life.
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and for life to end (""I can't live anymore,"" ""There has to be a non painful way to do this""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is personal and explicit, not abstract or unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out the desire. The phrase ""non painful way to do this"" indicates a desire to *find* a method, not that a method has been identified or a plan is in place. This absence of a concrete plan/method rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""kill myself,"" ""suicide note,"" ""with drugs.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Implied despair and a desire to end life. Concern for family's reaction (""upset,"" ""remembered,"" ""hope they understand me"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   **Plan/Imminence:** ""do it next week,"" ""kill myself next week."" This indicates a specific timeframe for a future action.

    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I want to do it,"" ""I want to kill myself."" This is a clear, explicit desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to do it,"" ""I want to kill myself"").
    *   The writer does *not* state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they state a clear intention to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""with drugs"") is mentioned.
    *   Yes, a sign of preparation (""write a suicide note"") is mentioned.
    *   The intent is high, and imminence is specified (""next week""), coupled with a method and preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a future intention (""next week"").
    *   It does *not* describe a past, initiated, potentially lethal action by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, it goes beyond mere thoughts/desire by mentioning a specific plan/timeframe (""next week""), a specific method (""with drugs""), and a preparation (""write a suicide note""). This combination of explicit suicidal intent *with* a plan/method/preparation fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past *initiated* action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm."" The phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" strongly implies a desire for life to end or for their suffering to cease, in a context that suggests a suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""always tired,"" ""so tired,"" ""no motivation,"" ""tired of being sick,"" ""pushing everyone away,"" ""saying hurtful things,"" ""none of the pills do enough,"" ""tired of working 40 hours a week,"" ""barely pay my bills,"" ""don't have enough money,"" ""don't have a family,"" ""so lonely,"" ""jealous."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, anhedonia, and a sense of being a burden/isolated.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., specific type of pills for overdose, gun, bridge), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The ""pills"" mentioned are in the context of medication for illness (""none of the pills do enough and i'm almost out of ones to try""), not as a suicidal method.
    *   **References to past actions:** No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
    *   **Imminence:** ""soon,"" ""long overdue."" This suggests a current and relatively high imminence for the implied action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" clearly expresses a personal desire for an end to their current state, which, in the context of the preceding despair, implies a desire for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" strongly conveys a desire for their life/suffering to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement ""I'm ready to get this over with soon"" implies a personal desire to act on this feeling.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. The mention of ""pills"" is in the context of medication for an illness, not as a means for suicide. There is no indication of *how* the ""getting this over with"" would occur.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. While ""get this over with soon"" is an intended action with high imminence, it lacks *any* indication of a method or specific action. It's an outcome, not a ""how.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""I'm ready to get this over with soon"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound despair and a clear desire for life to end (""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue""). This goes beyond general distress and indicates a clear personal suicidal desire. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out the implied suicidal act. While ""get this over with soon"" indicates an intention, it lacks the ""how"" or any specific action/method. The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action (even if the method is vague... coupled with high imminence), or preparations."" Here, the method is entirely absent.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire for life to end and suicidal thoughts/feelings, but without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft."" It also mentions ""it won't kill me, but it'll punish me for being such a nuisance to society."" This indicates a specific method (overdose of Zoloft) and a self-harming act.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I regret everything,"" ""suffering,"" ""punish me,"" ""nuisance,"" ""sorry."" There's also ambivalence: ""I regret it. I also don't.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method (500mg Zoloft overdose) and the act of taking it are described.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I finally went through. I have overdosed. I took 500mg Zoloft."" These are clear descriptions of a completed, self-initiated action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""It hasn't been that long, but I'm getting a headache and some other bullshit."" This indicates the action was very recent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over."" While the user states they don't want to die, they *did* take a potentially harmful action (overdose) to end their suffering and punish themselves. The action itself is the primary focus for classification.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? ""I just want my suffering to be over."" While they explicitly state ""I don't want to die,"" they *acted* in a way that is commonly associated with suicidal behavior (overdosing) to achieve an end to suffering. The action taken overrides the verbal negation of wanting to die for classification purposes, as the act itself is a form of self-harm with suicidal intent.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? They state they don't want to die, but they *did* act. The action is a completed event.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""I took 500mg Zoloft."" This is a specific substance and dosage, indicating a method and its execution.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of ""taking"" the pills implies execution of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *past, completed action*: ""I finally went through. I have overdosed. I took 500mg Zoloft."" The effects are described as current (""getting a headache"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes, ""I have overdosed. I took 500mg Zoloft."" This is a clear description of a self-initiated, potentially harmful action. The statement ""it won't kill me"" indicates the author's *belief* about the outcome, but the act of overdosing on medication is a potentially lethal action, regardless of the immediate outcome or the author's perception of its lethality. The definition of 'Attempt' includes actions that were ""potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly describes a *past, self-initiated action* (""I have overdosed,"" ""I took 500mg Zoloft"") that was potentially harmful or lethal. This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'.
    *   The user's statement ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over"" indicates distress and a desire for an end to pain, which often underlies suicidal acts, even if the explicit desire for death is negated. The crucial element for classification here is that a concrete, self-initiated action was taken.
    *   This is not 'Ideation' because a specific action has been taken, not just thoughts or desires.
    *   This is not 'Behavior' because it describes a *completed* or *initiated* act, not a future plan or preparation for an act.
    *   This is not 'Indicator' because a specific, self-harming action has occurred.

The presence of a described past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (overdose) by the author makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrases ""I'm doing it,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" and ""ready to go"" strongly imply an intention to end life. There is no mention of a specific method or means.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I feel so at peace right now"" and ""I'm ready"" indicate a calm resolve, which is often a significant warning sign of a decided suicidal intent.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned. ""Spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend"" could be interpreted as a farewell, but it's not a direct preparation for the act itself (like acquiring means or writing a note).
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""in the near future,"" ""now I think I'm ready to go,"" ""I'm ready."" This indicates high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear, explicit desire to end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but the intent is very clear through phrases like ""I'm doing it,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" and ""ready to go.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, unequivocally.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses peace and readiness to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The ""good time with my favourite person"" *could* be a subtle form of farewell, but it's not a concrete preparation for the act itself (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills"").
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context. The post states ""I'm doing it"" with high imminence. While ""I'm doing it"" implies an action, it lacks any indication of *how* or *what specific type* of action. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations being taken."" It also states: ""If there is genuine uncertainty about any plan, method, or intended action even after considering context, imminence, and intent, choose 'Ideation'."" In this case, there is no specific method, even vague, or clear preparation for the act itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a clear future intention (""in the near future,"" ""ready to go"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'Indicator' is incorrect because there is a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent.
    *   'Attempt' is incorrect because it describes a future intention, not a past initiated action.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   The post clearly expresses explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive any longer, with high imminence. This fits the 'Ideation' definition.
        *   For 'Behavior', the definition requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations being taken."" While ""I'm doing it"" implies an action, it does not specify *how* or *what* the action is, nor are there explicit preparations for the act. The definition for 'Behavior' also explicitly states: ""If there is genuine uncertainty about any plan, method, or intended action even after considering context, imminence, and intent, choose 'Ideation'."" Given the complete lack of any specific method or concrete preparation for the act itself, it falls short of the 'Behavior' criteria. The peace and readiness are emotional states and intent, not a plan or method.

Therefore, despite the high imminence and clear intent, the absence of any described plan, method, or concrete preparation for the act itself places it in 'Ideation'.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** The post describes a past event (""4 yrs ago"") where the author ""was suicidal"" and the school reacted poorly. It does not describe a specific *action* or *attempt*, but rather a past state of mind or ideation.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The event described is ""4 yrs ago"". There is no current or future intention stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The post is a reflection on a past negative experience. It does not express a current desire to die, for life to end, or current suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""i cant stop thinking about how when my old high school found out i was suicidal"" indicates the author is reflecting on a past memory where they *were* suicidal, not that they *are currently* suicidal.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""i was suicidal"".
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No, not *currently*. The desire is historical (""was suicidal""). The current sentiment is frustration about the past interaction.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The thoughts are presented as historical; the post's focus is on the school's reaction, not the author's current suicidal state. There is no current desire to die expressed.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""4 yrs ago"") where the author ""was suicidal"". There is no current or future intention.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. It states ""found out i was suicidal"", which implies a state of ideation, not an initiated attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly refers to a past state of being suicidal (""i was suicidal""). However, it does not express *current* suicidal intent, desire to die, or current suicidal thoughts. The primary focus is on the negative past experience with school counselors.
    *   It does not describe any specific plan, method, or preparation.
    *   It does not describe a past *attempt* (an initiated action), only a past state of ideation.
    *   Since there is no current expression of suicidal desire or intent, and the mention of ""suicidal"" is in the context of a historical event, this best fits 'Indicator'. It expresses general distress (about the past experience) and references a past state of being suicidal without indicating current personal suicidal intent.

But I know for a fact that **nothing will make me happier. Not even love, being rich, surrounded by loving friends and family, being smart/goodlooking enough for my own liking. Nothing will.**. And me being sad is dangerous. It's bad. I'm just a pretty shit person in general. Even when I'm happy I sound insane. Maybe I really am? I'm just trying to be kind, not selfish, considerate. I'm trying to fix things and they still manage to fall apart. Might as well just die.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** Explicitly asks ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and states ""Might as well just die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""sad for no reason,"" ""unexplainable void and sadness,"" ""panic attacks everyday,"" ""nothing will make me happier,"" ""me being sad is dangerous,"" ""pretty shit person,"" ""insane."" Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, and self-worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, or preparatory actions.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""not the first time, not the last one"" refers to the feeling of sadness, not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence:** The phrasing ""Should I just give up?"", ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ""Might as well just die"" indicates contemplation and a strong inclination towards suicide, but not an immediate, concrete plan for action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire for life to end and to die, expressed through direct questions and statements, without any negation of these thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""die"" in the context of the author's own life.
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end, reinforced by the profound hopelessness (""Nothing will make me happier"").
    *   The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. Instead, they are presented as a potential course of action due to despair.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   While intent is high, imminence is not so high as to imply a vague action without any method. The post is contemplative rather than action-oriented.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and contemplation of future action (""Should I..."", ""Might as well..."").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""might as well just die""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is clear and not negated.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for carrying out suicide. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""i should die"", ""kill myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""trash"", ""rubbish sucking at everything"", ""hate my family"", ""no friends"", ""so sensitive"", ""suffer from u?"", ""fuck"". Expresses feelings of worthlessness, being a burden, hopelessness, and anger.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""tho I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything."" This is a direct statement of preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** The phrase ""had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything"" refers to a decision and preparations made in the recent past. It does *not* describe an initiated suicidal action (e.g., ""I took pills"").
    *   **Imminence:** The preparations were made ""a few days"" ago, and the current post reiterates the desire to die. This suggests a current state of suicidal intent with preparations in place.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire to die (""i should die"", ""kill myself"") and for life to end (""Then my family doesn't need to raise trash anymore"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""i should die"" and ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and not be alive.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them. The desire is personal and explicit.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, or location is mentioned.
    *   Yes, there are clear signs of preparation: ""tho I have prepared everything."" This directly indicates preparations for a suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past decision and preparation (""had made up my mind... prepared everything a few days ago"") and current/ongoing suicidal intent.
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* by the author in the past. ""Prepared everything"" is a step *before* an attempt, not an attempt itself.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""i should die"", ""kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly states ""tho I have prepared everything."" This phrase directly indicates preparations for suicide, which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' (""preparations being taken""). It goes beyond mere ideation because preparations are mentioned.
    *   The post does not describe a past initiated suicidal action (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). It describes making a decision and preparing, not having carried out an action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit mention of ""prepared everything"" alongside clear suicidal intent, the most appropriate category is 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""Vanish without a trace,"" ""no one will find my body,"" ""pistol"" (as a means to an end), ""at the end."" The context clearly implies suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""nothing to look forward to""), feeling like a burden (""tired of my presence""), feeling unwanted (""never seemed to enjoy my company"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   **Plan:** ""pick a direction, and start walking. No phone or car to trace me, just cash and a pair of shoes. Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body."" This is a detailed plan for disappearance and finding a location for the act.
        *   **Method:** ""Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol."" This is a specific means/tool.
        *   **Preparations:** ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them."" These are concrete preparatory actions.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""Dont know when, but eventually my roommates will be tired of my presence and me to move out. When that happens I will have nothing to look forward to. So I would want to vanish..."" This indicates a future, contingent intention, but the plan is fully formed.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to end their life, expressed through the detailed plan to ""vanish without a trace"" and the mention of a ""pistol"" for ""the end.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. Phrases like ""vanish without a trace,"" ""no one will find my body,"" and the detailed plan culminating with a ""pistol"" at ""the end"" clearly express a desire for life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is detailing a plan they intend to follow.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, a ""pistol"" is mentioned as the tool, and a ""secluded spot where no one will find my body"" is the intended location.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them.""
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Here, the desire is present, and the plan, method, and preparations are *explicitly* detailed, not vague.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention and a detailed plan contingent on a future event.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, this is a future plan, not a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes far beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts (Indicator).
    *   It expresses a clear desire to die and end life, which is Ideation. However, it also includes a highly detailed plan, a specific method (""pistol""), and explicit preparations (""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings"").
    *   The presence of a specific plan, method, and preparations moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    *   It is not an 'Attempt' because no past or very recent *initiated* suicidal action is described. The post outlines a future plan.

Based on the explicit mention of a plan, a specific method (pistol), and preparations (emptying bank account, leaving belongings), this post fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I want to die."" ""Title says it all"" (referring to ""I want to die""). ""We all just fake it till we die and i give up now.""
    - Emotional indicators: Expresses extreme tiredness, despair (""life is shit""), hopelessness (""i give up now""), feeling scared (""it's all scary""), feeling uncared for, loss of self-recognition, and anger/frustration with the mental health system.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""Im this fucking close,"" ""i give up now."" This indicates high imminence of intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear, personal desire to die is expressed (""I want to die,"" ""i give up now""). It is not about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal desire.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to die,"" ""i give up now.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly personal and expressed.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context. The phrase ""Im this fucking close"" implies being close to acting, but it does not specify *how* or *what* the action would be. It indicates high imminence of intent but lacks any indication of a method, plan, or specific intended action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""I want to die,"" ""i give up now,"" ""Im this fucking close"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - It expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I want to die,"" ""i give up now"") with high imminence (""Im this fucking close"").
    - It does *not* include any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. The phrase ""Im this fucking close"" indicates high imminence of acting on the desire, but crucially, it does not specify *how* the action would be carried out. Without any mention of a method, even vague, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit as it captures the explicit personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts without a specified plan or method.

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

        *   ""when i do do it"" - clear reference to future suicide.
        *   ""i dont want the existance ive got"" - desire for life to end.
        *   ""it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone"" - implies death.
        *   ""although ive not gone and got a rope"" - mentions a specific method (rope) as something considered but not yet acquired.
        *   ""ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while"" - decision about location based on outcome.
        *   ""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it"" - specific location chosen.

        *   ""I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face"" - past self-harm, explicitly stated as such, not a suicide attempt.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""no one cares right now,"" ""feel so disconected,"" ""rotting away""), despair, feeling like a burden (""know many people will blame themselves"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something"" - preparation (isolation).
        *   ""decided i wont do it at home"" - part of a plan.
        *   ""recently decided the woodland where i would do it"" - specific location chosen.
        *   ""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police"" - specific preparation for aftermath.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""suicidal for about 10 years"" (ongoing state), ""acted out... self harm"" (past self-harm, not attempt). No past initiated suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge."" - high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die/end existence (""when i do do it,"" ""i dont want the existance ive got"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""Ive been suicidal,"" ""when i do do it,"" ""I dont want the existance ive got.""
    *   The writer expresses a clear desire to die/for life to end.
    *   The thoughts are not stated as unwanted; rather, the *feelings* are cyclical, but the intent to act when ""on the edge"" is present.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific location (""the woodland"") is mentioned.
    *   Yes, specific preparations (""leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police,"" ""pushed eveyone... making it easier to do something"") are mentioned.
    *   While a direct *method* isn't explicitly chosen and stated as acquired (e.g., ""I have a gun""), the mention of ""rope"" as something not yet acquired, combined with the chosen location and detailed plans for aftermath, strongly indicates a plan for a lethal act. The level of detail about location and aftermath goes beyond mere ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past experiences (being suicidal for 10 years, past self-harm, past help-seeking) and current/future intentions (""when i do do it,"" ""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it,"" ""I feel im on the edge"").
    *   It does *not* describe a past specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author that was an attempt. The self-harm is explicitly labeled as self-harm, not a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not 'Indicator' because there is clear, personal suicidal intent and desire to die.
    *   Not 'Attempt' because no past initiated suicidal action is described. The self-harm mentioned is explicitly not an attempt.
    *   Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""Ive been suicidal,"" ""I dont want the existance ive got""). However, it also includes specific elements of a plan and preparation: a chosen location (""the woodland""), a decision about where *not* to do it based on discovery concerns (""wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while""), and detailed plans for the aftermath (""leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers... and to call the police""). The act of pushing people away to ""make it easier to do something"" also indicates preparation. These elements move it beyond just thoughts into 'Behavior'.

    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/not be alive: ""I hate my life,"" ""I wanna off myself,"" ""I don't even wanna live anymore.""
    *   The writer does *not* state that these thoughts are unwanted; they are presented as personal desires.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.
    *   There are no signs of preparation.
    *   While explicit desire to die is present, there is no vague reference to action or how to act on it, nor any indication of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and intentions (""I wanna off myself,"" ""I don't even wanna live anymore"") in response to a recent frustrating event.
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I wanna off myself,"" ""I don't even wanna live anymore""). This rules out 'Indicator' because there is clear personal suicidal intent, and the thoughts are not stated as unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and desire to die without any specific plan, method, or preparation.

68,"Called the hotline, got told it was ""a bit silly"" to be suicidal at my age. wow thanks. Anyway tonight's the night I guess. Feeling kinda desperate to get help, also feeling kinda hopeless. No one in my life cares. I have no one to talk to. I have no one to help me stay alive. No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""suicidal"", ""tonight's the night I guess"", ""when I'm gone"", ""no one to help me stay alive"".
    - **Emotional indicators:** ""desperate to get help"", ""hopeless"", ""no one in my life cares"", ""no one to talk to"", ""no one to help me stay alive"", ""No one in my life will miss me"".
    - **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""tonight's the night I guess"" implies a highly imminent intended action. While no specific *method* (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned, the phrase itself indicates a plan to act on suicidal thoughts.
    - **References to past actions:** None.
    - **Imminence:** ""tonight's the night I guess"" indicates immediate or very near-future intent.
    - **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to end life (""tonight's the night I guess"", ""when I'm gone"", ""no one to help me stay alive""). There's also a conflicting desire for help, but the suicidal intent is present and strong.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and expresses a clear desire for life to end (""tonight's the night I guess"", ""when I'm gone"").
    - The writer does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. While they express a desire for help, the primary sentiment is one of acting on the suicidal thoughts ""tonight"".

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned.
    - No explicit preparations (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills"").
    - However, ""tonight's the night I guess"" is a strong statement of imminent *intended action*. The definition of Behavior includes ""an intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence)"". This phrase, combined with the explicit suicidal ideation and high imminence, fits the criteria for an intended action. It's not just a thought; it's a declaration of intent to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""tonight's the night"").
    - It does not describe a past, specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear personal suicidal intent (""suicidal"", ""tonight's the night I guess"").
    - It's not purely 'Ideation' because ""tonight's the night I guess"" goes beyond just thoughts or desire; it's a statement of imminent intended action. While no specific *method* is detailed, the phrase itself implies a plan to act, which aligns with the 'Behavior' definition's allowance for vague methods when imminence and intent are high.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because no past initiated action is described.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent (""suicidal"", ""no one to help me stay alive"") combined with the highly imminent statement of intended action (""tonight's the night I guess""), this falls under Behavior. The phrase ""tonight's the night"" indicates a plan to act, even if the specific means are not detailed.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Yes, ""oxy and cutting an artery"" are specific methods/means for self-harm/suicide. The question ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"" directly links these as a combined approach to a suicidal act.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask"" indicates distress, desperation, and potentially isolation, seeking information for a highly sensitive topic.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** The post is a direct inquiry about the practical execution of a specific method (combining oxycodone with cutting an artery) to reduce pain during the act. This implies active consideration and research into a plan/method.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the nature of the question, seeking practical information about combining lethal methods, suggests current, active contemplation of such an act.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** While not explicitly saying ""I want to die,"" the detailed and practical question about combining specific lethal methods strongly implies a desire to carry out such an act. It's not expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts; it's seeking information on *how* to perform the act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? It doesn't use explicit phrases like ""I want to die."" However, the very specific and practical nature of the question about combining lethal methods (""oxy and cutting an artery"") to ""lessen the pain"" strongly implies a personal intent to perform a suicidal act. This goes beyond mere passive ideation.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the user is actively seeking information to facilitate the act, not to resist it.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""oxy"" (a substance) and ""cutting an artery"" (a specific method, implying a tool like a blade). These are concrete means.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The question itself, seeking practical information about combining methods for pain reduction, can be considered a form of preparation or research into the execution of a plan. It's not just a thought; it's an inquiry about the *how*.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The desire is strongly implied by the nature of the question, and the methods are specific. This is not vague.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current inquiry about a potential future action.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   This is not 'Indicator' because it goes far beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. It involves specific suicidal methods.
    *   This is not 'Ideation' because 'Ideation' is defined as thoughts or desire without any *specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations*. Here, ""oxy"" and ""cutting an artery"" are *specific methods*, and the question is about their practical application. This moves beyond mere thoughts into the realm of planning or exploring the execution of a specific act.
    *   This fits 'Behavior' because it includes implied suicidal intent (from the nature of the question) and explicitly mentions specific methods (""oxy,"" ""cutting an artery""). The inquiry about combining them for pain reduction is a form of exploring or planning the execution of these methods.
    *   This is not 'Attempt' as no past initiated action is described.

Therefore, the post clearly indicates the contemplation of specific methods and a practical inquiry into their use, which falls under 'Behavior'.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post repeatedly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide."" However, these are consistently framed as *the friend's words* or *the friend's perception* (""my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself,"" ""she's scared you're going to commit suicide""). The author is reacting to these words, not expressing them as their own intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author expresses significant hurt, upset, and distress (""not sitting well with me at all,"" ""hurt me,"" ""brutal,"" ""thoughtless and hurtful,"" ""barely speak to her,"" ""don't know what to do""). They also state they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned by the author. The post is about the impact of the friend's words.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal *actions* initiated by the author are mentioned. The friend's prediction is about the future, and the author's response was to try and joke and change the subject, stating they are fighting their mental illness.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** There are no stated intentions by the author regarding suicide. The imminence is related to the friend's prediction, not the author's plan.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer's stated desire is to understand if they are justified in being hurt by their friend's words and to seek advice on how to handle the situation. They explicitly state they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness"" and imply they would have tried to reassure the friend if the friend had expressed fear, rather than a brutal prediction. There is no personal desire to die expressed; rather, distress about the friend's perception.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, but *only* as attributed to the friend's statements/perceptions.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. The author's distress is about the friend's words and their impact, not about a personal desire for death.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** The author states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness."" While not a direct negation of *suicidal thoughts*, the overall context is that the author is fighting their illness and is deeply hurt by the friend's lack of faith, implying they are *not* embracing suicidal intent. The post is a plea for advice on a social interaction, not a cry for help regarding personal suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied by the author in relation to a suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past conversation (""A couple of weeks ago..."") and the ongoing emotional impact and social dilemma it has created for the author.
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, hurt, and frustration. It discusses suicide, but only as a concept introduced by the friend's hurtful words. Crucially, the author *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent*. Instead, they are actively fighting their mental illness and are seeking advice on how to handle a social conflict. The mentions of suicide are external (from the friend) and the author's reaction is one of hurt and disbelief, not agreement or personal ideation. This fits the definition of 'Indicator'.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because there is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to die from the author. The focus is on the friend's words and the author's reaction to them.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' as there is no plan, method, or intended action.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as there is no description of a past initiated suicidal action by the author.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""jump out"" (implies death/suicide), ""cut the screen"" (self-harm/means to facilitate jumping), ""scissors"" (tool).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""please please please help me,"" ""i feel like im about to,"" ""i dont know what to do,"" ""im only a teen,"" ""my parents and siblings are asleep"" (desperation, fear, feeling alone, ambivalence, high distress).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""at my window right now with scissors,"" ""cut the screen and jump out."" This describes a specific location, a specific tool, and a specific intended action.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""right now,"" ""im about to."" This indicates extreme imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer is expressing a strong, immediate urge to act on suicidal thoughts (""feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out""). While asking for help, this does not negate the described intent and preparation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly using those words.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""jump out"" from a window clearly implies a desire to end life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. While they express distress and ask for help, they are describing an *imminent urge to act* rather than explicitly stating they don't want the thoughts or to act on them. The plea for help indicates ambivalence, but the description of being ""at my window right now with scissors"" and ""about to cut the screen and jump out"" indicates a strong, active intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes.
        *   Method: ""jump out"" (from a window).
        *   Tool: ""scissors"" (to ""cut the screen"").
        *   Location: ""at my window right now.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, being ""at my window right now with scissors"" and stating ""im about to cut the screen"" are clear signs of active preparation and imminent action.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Here, the method and plan are quite specific and highly imminent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, highly imminent future intention (""right now,"" ""im about to"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, the action is described as being ""about to"" happen, not as having already happened.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is a clear personal expression of suicidal intent (implied by the described action) and a specific method/plan/imminent action.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. This goes beyond mere thoughts or desire because a specific plan, method, and imminent intended action are described.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits perfectly. The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (implied by the intent to jump) AND mentions a specific plan, method, and preparations being taken (""at my window right now with scissors, i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out""). The imminence is extremely high.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The action has not yet been initiated; it is described as being ""about to"" happen.

Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""overdose on iron pills"" is a specific method of self-harm/suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""pain everyday,"" ""don't wanna deal with it"" indicates severe distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape suffering. ""i'm sorry"" suggests resignation or a farewell.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""i'm gonna overdose on iron pills"" is a clear statement of intent with a specific method (iron pills) and action (overdose).
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""i'm gonna overdose"" implies a current decision and future action, suggesting high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""i don't wanna deal with it"" clearly indicates a desire for the current pain/life to end, which is linked directly to the suicidal action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   While ""suicide"" isn't explicitly used, ""overdose on iron pills"" is a direct statement of a suicidal act.
    *   The post expresses a clear desire for life to end to escape pain: ""i don't wanna deal with it.""
    *   There is no negation of suicidal thoughts or desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method (""iron pills"") and action (""overdose"") are explicitly mentioned. This is a clear plan/intended action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current/future intention (""i'm gonna overdose"").
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to end suffering and a direct intention to act on it. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by stating a specific method (""iron pills"") and an intended action (""overdose""). This differentiates it from 'Ideation'.
    *   It describes a *future* intended action, not a *past initiated* action. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior' rather than 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""im going to kill myself one day,"" ""might as well die,"" ""just want to disappear,"" ""run away to a forest and fucking die.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""deferred from my dream school,"" ""chances of that are so slim""), despair (""i hate it!""), feeling like a failure (""i feel like a failure who might as well die""), social isolation/bullying (""everyone makes fun of at school,"" ""no friends""), feeling trapped (""control me financially so that i dont run away"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned. ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" mentions a location and a desire to die there, but not *how* they would die in the forest. There are no signs of preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""one day"" suggests a future, non-immediate intent. The statement ""The only thing thats stopping is that there is still a chance..."" indicates a deterrent, further reducing immediate imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire to die or for life to end, not just distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""im going to kill myself one day.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""might as well die,"" ""just want to disappear,"" ""run away to a forest and fucking die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly personal and expressed.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" mentions a location (""forest"") but no specific *method* of dying (e.g., how they would die in the forest). This is a desire for an escape and an end, not a concrete plan.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: The imminence is not high (""one day,"" stated deterrent). The ""forest"" mention is not sufficient to qualify as a specific method/plan without further detail, especially given the lack of immediate intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current desire and future intention (""im going to kill myself one day"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""im going to kill myself one day,"" ""might as well die,"" ""just want to disappear,"" ""run away to a forest and fucking die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for carrying out suicide. While ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" mentions a location, it doesn't specify a method of death, and the overall context (lack of imminence, stated deterrent) suggests it's a strong desire/fantasy rather than a concrete plan. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without a specific plan, method, or preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""Hoping to be murdered."" - Desire for death by external means.
        *   ""I hate being alive"" - Clear desire to not be alive.
        *   ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself"" - Explicit mention of suicide, but a stated *inability* to act on it *personally*.
        *   ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me"" - Desire for death by external means.
        *   ""assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people."" - Discusses a concept of suicide, personally desired.
        *   ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works."" - Repeated passive action hoping for death by external means (murder). This is not a self-initiated suicidal method.
        *   ""to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself."" - Desire to end life, explicitly linked to personal inability to commit suicide.
        *   ""how much I want to die."" - Explicit desire to die.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hate being alive,"" ""losing more hope,"" ""difficult to endure,"" ""tearing up randomly,"" ""crying myself to sleep,"" ""useless I am,"" ""alone I am,"" ""defective and unfit to be alive."" - Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and profound emotional suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No self-initiated plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The methods discussed (murder, assisted suicide) are external or require external intervention. The act of walking through sketchy areas is a passive seeking of death by external means, not a self-initiated suicidal plan or method.
    *   **References to past actions:** The ""walking through sketchy areas every night"" is a repeated behavior, but it's a passive seeking of death, not a past self-initiated suicidal act or attempt.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire for death is constant and ongoing (""every night,"" ""every single day""). However, there is no imminence of *self-initiated* action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, strong, and consistent desire to die or for life to end. The key nuance is the explicit statement of lacking the bravery to *kill themselves*, leading to a wish for death by *external* means.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""assisted suicide,"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I hate being alive,"" ""want to die,"" ""end it all"").
    *   The writer does *not* state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. Instead, they explicitly state they *do* want to die, but lack the personal capacity/bravery to initiate it themselves.
    *   This confirms a strong personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific self-initiated method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied for a *suicidal act by the author*. The desire is for *murder* or *assisted suicide*, which are external.
    *   There are no signs of self-initiated preparation.
    *   The repeated action of ""walking through sketchy areas"" is a passive behavior hoping for an external event (murder), not a self-initiated plan or method for suicide. The post explicitly states ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself."" Therefore, there is no self-initiated plan or intended action. This rules out 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current and ongoing desire for death.
    *   It does not describe a past or very recent specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated by the author* with the intent to die. The passive seeking of murder is not a self-initiated suicidal attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a profound and explicit personal desire to die and for life to end (""I hate being alive,"" ""want to die,"" ""end it all""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, the post explicitly states the author's *inability* or *cowardice* regarding *killing themselves* and instead expresses a wish for death by *external means* (murder, assisted suicide). There is no mention of a self-initiated plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The ""walking through sketchy areas"" is a passive seeking of death by external means, not a self-initiated suicidal plan.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die, but without any specific self-initiated plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.

75,"I'm actually glad I'm going to die and my favorite part is I'll experience it painfully. I'm not exactly sure why I am here. I always felt unwanted so I think I'm going to leave. My day count for life is 8,000 days, isn't that crazy? 8,000 fucking days of this shithole. 8,000 days and I can't take no more. What a joke. See you all on the other side. Take care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I'm going to die,"" ""I'll experience it painfully,"" ""I'm going to leave,"" ""See you all on the other side."" No specific method is mentioned, only the *experience* of pain.
    - Emotional indicators: ""glad I'm going to die,"" ""not exactly sure why I am here,"" ""always felt unwanted,"" ""can't take no more,"" ""shithole,"" ""joke."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, and a desire for life to end.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None. The phrase ""painfully"" describes the desired *sensation* or *outcome*, not a specific *method* or *tool*. ""I'm going to leave"" and ""See you all on the other side"" imply an action, but lack any detail about *how*.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: High imminence (""I'm going to die,"" ""I'm going to leave,"" ""can't take no more"").
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear and strong desire to die and for life to end. The writer states they are ""glad"" about it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words, but ""I'm going to die"" and ""I'm going to leave"" and ""See you all on the other side"" are direct expressions of intent to end life.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, unequivocally (""I'm actually glad I'm going to die,"" ""I'm going to leave,"" ""can't take no more"").
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite; the writer expresses being ""glad"" about the impending death.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""Painfully"" is not a method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context. The imminence is high, and ""I'm going to leave"" implies action. However, the *how* remains completely vague. The definition for Behavior states: ""If there is genuine uncertainty about any plan, method, or intended action even after considering context, imminence, and intent, choose 'Ideation'."" There is genuine uncertainty about the method or plan here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""I'm going to die,"" ""I'm going to leave"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal, current desire to die and end life with high imminence. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific past initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. While the intent and imminence are very high, and there's a clear desire for action (""I'm going to leave""), there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The phrase ""I'll experience it painfully"" describes the desired *sensation* or *outcome* of death, not a specific *method* (e.g., it doesn't say ""I'm going to jump off a building so it's painful""). Without any indication of *how* the action will be carried out (e.g., pills, gun, location, specific action like jumping/hanging), it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The key differentiator for 'Behavior' is the presence of a plan, method, or preparation. Since this is absent, it falls into 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post contains phrases like ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" and ""im starting to want to wave the white flag."" These are strong expressions of a desire to end life or give up on living. There are no explicit mentions of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" nor any specific methods or means.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming sadness, anxiety, depression, tiredness, feeling like a burden, self-blame, feeling hurt, feeling alone, soul hurting, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've tried every antidepressant known to man,"" ""I've tried every way to cope."" These refer to past coping mechanisms and treatments, not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The statements are current (""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" ""im starting to want to wave the white flag""), indicating a present and ongoing desire to give up.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to not be alive and to give up on the struggle of life. The thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted; they appear to be the writer's genuine feelings.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" etc.? No.
    *   Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, strongly implied by ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" and ""im starting to want to wave the white flag."" These convey a profound desire for an end to their suffering and existence.
    *   Explicitly unwanted thoughts? No, the desire is expressed as the writer's own feeling, not as an intrusive thought they are fighting against.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned/implied? No.
    *   Signs of preparation? No.
    *   Vague reference to action implying a method/plan with high imminence? No. The phrases are about a desire to give up, but not about *how* that would happen.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Describes past event, current/future intention, or both? Primarily current feelings and intentions to give up.
    *   Describes a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past? No. Past actions mentioned are related to coping and treatment, not suicidal acts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to not be alive and to give up on life (""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" ""im starting to want to wave the white flag""). This goes beyond general distress or abstract thoughts.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out these desires.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of wanting life to end or not to be alive, without any specific plan or action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I have to kill myself,"" ""Death is my only option right now,"" ""I have to do this.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I have nothing,"" ""no reason to stay here,"" ""future is fucked,"" ""Nothing is going well,"" ""isn't getting better""), despair (""crappy life,"" ""head has gone to shit""), isolation (""no friends""), burden (""worse staying alive"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The phrase ""I have to do this"" expresses intent to act but no ""how.""
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""right now,"" ""I have to do this."" This indicates high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear, explicit desire to die and end life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""Death is my only option.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and for life to end (""I have to kill myself,"" ""Death is my only option right now,"" ""It'd be worse staying alive"").
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; they are presented as their current, personal desire and conclusion.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - Although there is high imminence and a strong desire to act (""I have to do this""), there is no indication of *how* this action would be carried out. The definition for Behavior requires ""some form of explicit planning or intended action element like a specific method... or a stated intention to act with some indication of *how*, however vague, if imminence is high."" The post lacks any ""how,"" even vague.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""right now,"" ""I have to do this"").
    - It does not describe a past specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, explicit, personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die (""I have to kill myself,"" ""Death is my only option"").
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die, coupled with high imminence, points towards 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'.
    - To be 'Behavior', there must be a plan, method, or preparation, or a stated intention to act with *some indication of how*, however vague. Despite the high imminence and strong intent (""I have to do this""), the post provides no details whatsoever about *how* the suicide would be carried out (e.g., no mention of pills, jumping, a specific location, or even a vague ""do something physical""). The instruction states: ""If there is genuine uncertainty about any plan, method, or intended action even after considering context, imminence, and intent, choose 'Ideation'."" In this case, there is no plan/method mentioned at all, not just uncertainty. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' more accurately.

The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""he was suicidal like me some time ago,"" indicating the author's past suicidal state. It also contains strong desires to ""donate my life"" and ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" These are clear expressions of a desire for life to end. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I don't deserve, nor want to live""), despair, and a strong sense of self-sacrifice/altruism (wishing to donate life to someone else).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. The desire to ""donate life"" is a metaphorical wish, not a concrete plan for suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""he was suicidal like me some time ago"" refers to a past *state* of being suicidal, not a past *attempt* (initiated action).
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No imminence is stated. The desire is expressed as a wish (""I really wish,"" ""I just wish"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit stated desire to not live (""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" ""I wish I could donate my life""). This is not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a personal desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" in reference to the author's past state.
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" ""I wish I could donate my life"").

    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past. ""Suicidal"" refers to ideation, not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" This is a concrete, self-initiated action. While not an immediate lethal method like taking an overdose, stopping critical medications (like blood pressure meds) and psychiatric meds abruptly can have serious, potentially life-threatening consequences, and is presented here as a deliberate step towards death (""kill me faster""). This constitutes a preparation/intended action.
        *   ""Soda and junk will kill me faster."" This is a stated method/intended action to hasten death, a deliberate choice linked to the desire to die.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions a clear desire to die (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon,"" ""kill me faster"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes. ""I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" This is a specific, self-initiated action and preparation, presented as a means to an end (""kill me faster""). Abruptly stopping blood pressure medication, for example, can be dangerous.
    *   ""Soda and junk will kill me faster."" This is also a stated method/intended action, even if long-term, it's explicitly linked to the desire for death.
    *   These are concrete actions the author intends to take, going beyond just thoughts.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current and future intentions (""I'm ready to die,"" ""I'm stopping all my meds today,"" ""Hope it all ends soon,"" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"").
    *   It does not describe a past, initiated, potentially lethal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes explicit suicidal ideation (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon"").
    *   Crucially, it goes beyond mere thoughts by stating specific, intended actions/preparations: ""I'm stopping all my meds today"" (including critical ones like blood pressure meds, explicitly linked to ""kill me faster"") and the intention to use ""soda and junk"" to ""kill me faster."" These are deliberate steps the author intends to take to hasten their death. This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition which includes ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations being taken."" The stopping of medications, especially critical ones, is a significant action with potential health consequences, and is presented as a deliberate step towards death.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit desire to die coupled with concrete, intended actions/preparations to hasten death, the classification is 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""I just want to disappear"" strongly implies a desire to cease to exist or for life to end. ""Free from all this pain"" reinforces this desire to escape suffering through non-existence. No explicit mention of suicide or specific methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Broken remainings of my soul,"" ""all this pain."" These indicate profound emotional distress, hopelessness, and suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I just want to"" indicates a current desire, but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is given.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to ""disappear"" and be ""free from all this pain,"" which implies a wish for life to end. It is not stated as an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""I just want to disappear"" is a common euphemism for wanting to die or cease to exist, especially when coupled with ""free from all this pain."" This is a clear expression of wanting life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the desire is expressed as a personal wish.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: No high imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") and no vague action is implied, only a state of being (""disappear,"" ""be free"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention (""I just want to disappear"").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear personal desire to cease to exist (""disappear"") and be free from pain, which strongly implies a wish for life to end. This goes beyond general distress and is a direct expression of suicidal ideation, even if euphemistic.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer or for life to end, without any specific plan or action.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide"". These are explicit.
    - Emotional indicators: The rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" indicates profound despair and a serious consideration of suicide. ""Goodnight"" could be interpreted as a farewell.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""I just need a plan for suicide"". This is a direct statement of seeking or needing a plan. While no specific method is stated, the intent to form a plan is explicit.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The phrase ""Goodnight"" combined with the desire for a plan suggests a potential for imminent action once a plan is acquired.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to die, expressed through the question and the need for a plan.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"".
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"").
    - No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions. On the contrary, they are seeking a plan.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned.
    - However, the statement ""I just need a plan for suicide"" is a direct indication of seeking or intending to formulate a plan for a suicidal act. This goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts/desire) into active cognitive preparation or intent to act. It implies that the only barrier to action is the lack of a concrete plan. This is a form of intended action/preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current state and a future intention (to find a plan and act).
    - It does not describe any past initiated, potentially lethal actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The crucial element is ""I just need a plan for suicide"". This is not merely passive ideation (thoughts/desire without a plan). It indicates an active step towards carrying out the act by explicitly stating the need for a plan. This falls under the 'Behavior' definition which includes ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide"" or ""intended action"". While the plan itself isn't detailed, the *intention to acquire a plan* is stated, which is a significant step beyond just having the thought.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with the stated need for a plan aligns best with 'Behavior'.

        *   ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (contextualizes a past event related to harm/death)
        *   ""my most recent failed attempt"" (explicit mention of a past suicide attempt)
        *   ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" (explicit self-harm intention)
        *   ""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out"" (simulated method of suicide/self-harm)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Seeking validation (""find someone who relates,"" ""am I crazy or can anyone else relate?""), distress (implied by the nature of the intrusive thoughts/actions).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No *current* specific plan or preparation for a *future* suicidal act is mentioned. The ""finger gun"" is a simulated action, not a plan. ""Hurt myself really badly"" is general self-harm, not a specific suicide plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""my most recent failed attempt"" is a direct and clear reference to a past self-initiated suicidal action. ""I wish I stayed in the car"" is directly linked to this past attempt.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The ""I'm going to kill myself"" is described as an ""almost uncontrollably saying,"" suggesting intrusive thoughts/verbalizations rather than an immediate plan. ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" is a future intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The mention of a ""failed attempt"" and ""I wish I stayed in the car"" indicates a past desire to die. While the current verbalizations are described as ""uncontrollable,"" the overall context, including the past attempt and current self-harm thoughts, points to underlying suicidal distress.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""failed attempt.""
    *   Yes, the post implies a desire to die through the reference to the ""failed attempt"" and wishing they ""stayed in the car.""
    *   The writer describes the verbalization as ""almost uncontrollably saying,"" which suggests an intrusive nature, but it does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. The presence of a past attempt and current self-harm thoughts adds weight to the underlying intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific *current* plan, method, or preparation for a future suicidal act is mentioned. The ""finger gun"" is a simulated action, not a real plan. ""Hurt myself really badly"" is a general intention, not a specific suicidal method/plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a clear past event: ""my most recent failed attempt."" This is a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author. The timeframe (""most recent"") indicates it's not ancient history, but even if it were, the rules state ""Attempt"" takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described.
    *   It also describes current/future intentions (""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"") and current simulated actions (""putting a finger gun in my mouth"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The most critical piece of information is the explicit mention of ""my most recent failed attempt."" According to the definitions, 'Attempt' applies when ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical... if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    *   Even though there are elements of Ideation (the ""I'm going to kill myself"" verbalizations, ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"") and Behavior (the simulated ""finger gun"" action), the presence of a clearly stated past *attempt* by the author takes precedence as per the instructions: ""'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.""

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me. Girls and guys. I hate my life. I've lost all my sanity and I don't know what to do.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states, ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal."" These are direct expressions of suicidal intent and desire for life to end. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I Hate Being Ugly,"" ""condescending and mean,"" ""inferior,"" ""terrible,"" ""angry,"" ""sick of it,"" ""lost all my sanity,"" ""don't know what to do,"" ""I hate my life."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None are mentioned. There is no indication of a plan, a specific method, or any preparations being made.
    *   **References to past actions:** The author mentions being ""abused my entire life"" and ""socially inept for the longest time."" These are past experiences contributing to their current state, but not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The statements ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal"" reflect a current state of mind. There is no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""), but the intent is clearly present.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and genuine wish to not live anymore and an explicit statement of being ""suicidal."" This is not about unwanted thoughts, but a personal desire/feeling.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I'm angry and suicidal.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I hate my life.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statements indicate a personal desire and feeling, not an unwanted intrusion.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While there is strong desire, there is no vague reference to an *action* or *how* they might act, only the *feeling* and *desire*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and intentions (""I genuinely do not want to live anymore,"" ""I'm angry and suicidal"") and past experiences that contribute to these feelings.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. There is no mention of any past attempt or initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post contains clear, explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal"") and a desire to not be alive (""I genuinely do not want to live anymore,"" ""I hate my life""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post expresses clear suicidal intent and desire to die. However, it completely lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. Without these elements, it cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** There is no description of any past or very recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

    Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without any concrete plan, method, or action. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

I started college this year and its been so horrible. I was robbed of a place to stay so I've had to live at home while everyone else has parties and enjoys their college experience. I haven't made a single friend, let alone done anything fun. At this point it just feels like I'm just going through the motions. Is this my life now?

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""I'd rather kill myself now"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""endless torment,"" ""horrible,"" ""struggling,"" ""nobody to talk to,"" ""nothing to do,"" ""don't want it"" (referring to life). These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, isolation, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge), tools, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned or implied.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""now,"" ""another day of this seemingly endless torment."" This indicates high imminence regarding the desire to die.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""If that's what my life is going to be I don't want it. I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day of this seemingly endless torment."" This is a clear, unambiguous desire for life to end through suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and for life to end (""I don't want it,"" ""I'd rather kill myself now"").
    *   The writer does *not* state that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they are presented as a preferred alternative to enduring their current life.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   Despite high imminence (""now""), there is no indication of *how* the suicidal act would be carried out. The statement is one of intent, not a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a current/future intention (""I'd rather kill myself now"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post contains a clear, personal, and explicit expression of suicidal intent (""I'd rather kill myself now""), which is not stated as unwanted.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits well. There is an explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'd rather kill myself now""), coupled with profound expressions of wanting life to end. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. While there is high imminence and clear intent, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations. The post lacks the ""how"" or ""what"" aspect required for Behavior.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated potentially lethal action.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I want to kill myself,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger,"" ""how it would feel to die."" A specific method (gunshot to the head) is mentioned as an urge/thought.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared,"" ""pussy"" (self-deprecating), ""thoughts rushing through my head."" Shows internal conflict and distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A method (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"") is mentioned, but immediately negated by ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"" and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it."" There are no preparations mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""every single day I still have the urge."" The urges are ongoing, but the *action* is explicitly stated as not being carried out.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I want to kill myself"" indicates a genuine desire to die, despite the ambivalence (""I'm scared,"" ""I don't want to leave my cats/friends"") and the stated inability to act. The core desire/urge is present.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I want to kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to kill myself,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states they ""don't want to leave"" loved ones and ""can never bring myself to actually do it,"" indicating an *inhibition* or *inability* to act, not that the *thoughts themselves are unwanted* or that they don't have a personal desire to die. The desire to die is present, but they are struggling with acting on it. This is not 'Indicator' level negation.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"" implies a gun.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, the post explicitly states: ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"" and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it."" This means that despite the specific method being present in their thoughts/urges, there is no *intended action*, *plan*, or *preparation* to carry it out. The author is stating an *inability* to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current, ongoing urges and thoughts.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   A specific method (""blow my brains out"") is mentioned, which might initially suggest 'Behavior'. However, the critical phrases ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"" and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it"" explicitly state that there is no *plan*, *intended action*, or *preparation* to carry out the method. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a plan, method, intended action, or preparations. While a method is *thought of*, the *intent to act* on it is explicitly negated. Therefore, it remains 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

86,"kill me. i'll dm the address, please come here and murder me i beg of you end my horrible life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me"", ""murder me"", ""end my horrible life"". These are direct expressions of a desire for death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""i beg of you"" indicates extreme distress and desperation. ""horrible life"" indicates profound despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly asks someone to ""come here and murder me"" and states ""i'll dm the address"". This constitutes a specific method (murder by another person) and a specific location (the address), which the author is offering to provide as a means for the desired outcome. While it's a request for another to act, it's the author's stated plan for how they want to die.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The phrases ""please come here"" and ""i'll dm the address"" suggest a current and urgent desire for the action to take place.
    - Stated desire: A very clear and strong desire to die and for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill me,"" ""murder me,"" and ""end my horrible life.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they are actively soliciting the action.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""murder me"") and location (""the address"") are mentioned. The author offering to ""dm the address"" is a form of preparation to facilitate the desired lethal action. This is a clear plan for how the author wishes to die, even if it involves another party.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""please come here and murder me"").
    - It does not describe a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts or desire. It includes a specific method (""murder me"") and an offer to provide the location (""dm the address""), which serves as a preparation for the intended lethal outcome. This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    - It does not describe a past initiated action by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category as it includes explicit suicidal desire along with a stated plan/method and preparation for carrying it out.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city.

But I don't see a way out, and I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time."" (mentions dying)
        *   ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen."" (refers to making ""it"" happen, implying suicide/death, but explicitly negates intent to act)
        *   ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"" (implies a desire for an end to current suffering, which can be interpreted as a passive desire for life to end, but not necessarily active suicidal intent).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""feeling of dread,"" ""don't see a way out,"" ""worse off than before,"" ""feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None related to suicide/self-harm.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No immediate intention to act is stated. The statement ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" actively negates immediate or future deliberate intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There's a passive desire for an end to suffering (""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore""), and a lack of fear of dying. However, the explicit negation ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" is crucial. This indicates that while the thoughts/feelings are present, the author does not intend to act on them or actively cause their own death.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"" implies a wish for an end to struggle/life. However, this is immediately qualified by ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, the statement ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" clearly indicates a lack of intent to act on any passive desire for things to end. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition's clause about explicitly unwanted thoughts or lack of current personal desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a vague reference to action implying a method or plan? No, the opposite is stated by negating deliberate action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings of distress and a passive wish for things to end, but explicitly negates future deliberate action.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a passive wish for an end to suffering (""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore""). This could lean towards Ideation if not for the strong negation.
    *   However, the author explicitly states, ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen."" This statement is critical. It indicates that while there are thoughts/feelings related to death or an end to life, the author does not have a current, personal desire to *actively cause their own death* or act on these thoughts.
    *   Comparing with definitions:
        *   **Ideation** requires a ""clear, current, personal expression of desire to die"" *without* explicit negation of intent to act. The negation here (""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"") pushes it away from Ideation.
        *   **Behavior** requires a plan/method/intended action, which is absent.
        *   **Attempt** requires a past initiated action, which is absent.
        *   **Indicator** states: ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The author's statement ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" fits this perfectly. They are expressing distress and a passive feeling about life ending, but not an active, personal desire to make it happen.

Therefore, despite the profound despair, the explicit negation of deliberate action places this post in the Indicator category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" and ""I still thought about suicide."" It also expresses a desire to ""collapse and let go,"" which, in the context of suicidal thoughts, implies a desire to end suffering/life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""disappointed,"" ""crushed and empty,"" ""too hard,"" ""can't keep getting false hope,"" ""pain.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. There is no indication of a tool, location, substance, or any preparatory actions.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""anniversary of something that could've been"" is mentioned, but this is not a past suicidal action by the author. ""past me would've been so disappointed"" is a reflection, not an action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The thoughts are described as ""getting stronger and stronger,"" indicating a current and escalating state, but no immediate plan is stated. The desire to ""collapse and let go"" is present.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a clear desire for the pain to end and explicitly states having suicidal thoughts that are getting stronger. There is no negation of these thoughts; rather, the past thought of ""powering through"" is contrasted with the current feeling of being ""back to square one.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" and ""thought about suicide.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, ""I just want to collapse and let go"" in the context of overwhelming pain and increasing suicidal thoughts indicates a desire for life/suffering to end.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No. While they previously ""thought that maybe I can power through,"" the current state is ""back to square one"" with thoughts getting ""stronger and stronger,"" and the concluding phrase ""I just want to collapse and let go"" indicates a desire for release, not a rejection of the thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan?** ""I just want to collapse and let go"" is a desire for cessation, not an implied action with a method. There's no ""do something"" that suggests a *how*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** Primarily current feelings and escalating suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No. There is no mention of any past self-initiated suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal ""suicidal thoughts"" and a desire for life/suffering to end (""I just want to collapse and let go""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, indicating a genuine personal desire for release. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   While there is clear suicidal ideation, there is absolutely no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or any preparations being taken. This lack of a concrete plan or action distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action by the author. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Based on the explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts and desire for life to end, without any accompanying plan or action, the post best fits the 'Ideation' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""planning to kill myself tonight,"" ""Rest In Peace ya'll.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, isolation (""Everyone is asleep,"" ""Everyone who could help me is asleep now""), a sense of responsibility for their own actions (""This is my problem, my illness, it's on me. I expect nothing from no one.""), and a farewell sentiment (""Rest In Peace ya'll"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""planning to kill myself tonight"" is a clear statement of intent to act with a specific timeframe. The phrases ""I don't wish them any grief or guilt"" and ""Rest In Peace ya'll"" function as a goodbye or farewell, indicating preparation. While a specific *method* isn't detailed, the *intent to act* and the *plan* are explicitly stated.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""tonight"" indicates immediate and high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A clear and explicit desire to die and end their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and for life to end (""planning to kill myself tonight"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they state an intent to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method is not mentioned, but the phrase ""planning to kill myself tonight"" explicitly states an intended action and a plan.
    *   Yes, there are signs of preparation: ""I don't wish them any grief or guilt"" and ""Rest In Peace ya'll"" serve as a farewell message.
    *   Given the explicit desire to die and high imminence (""tonight""), the direct statement ""planning to kill myself"" clearly implies an intended action and plan, even without a specific method detailed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current/future intention (""planning to kill myself tonight"").
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""planning to kill myself tonight""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by explicitly stating a *plan* (""planning to kill myself"") and indicating *imminence* (""tonight"") and *preparation* (farewell message). This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   It describes a *future intended action*, not a *past initiated action*. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Based on the presence of explicit suicidal intent, a stated plan, high imminence, and signs of preparation, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

90,I need to make myself suffer extraordinary pain for the decisions I've made in my past that have led me to where I am now. And I'm starting to think suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing. I don't belong here. I need to leave,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing."" The phrase ""make myself suffer extraordinary pain"" is a strong emotional indicator and a desire for self-inflicted harm, explicitly linked to suicide as the ultimate means. ""I need to leave"" implies a desire to end existence.
    - Emotional indicators: ""suffer extraordinary pain,"" ""I don't belong here."" These indicate profound despair, self-reproach, and a sense of alienation.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. No specific tool, location, or action (e.g., pills, gun, bridge, writing a note).
    - References to past actions: No past initiated actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""I'm starting to think suicide is the only thing..."" indicates a current and developing thought process. ""I need to leave"" suggests a present desire for action.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire for suicide as the ""only thing that even come close to sufficing"" for their pain, and a strong statement ""I don't belong here. I need to leave."" This is a genuine wish for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing,"" and ""I don't belong here. I need to leave"" clearly express a desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is explicitly stated and not negated.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While ""I need to leave"" implies action, it lacks any specific *how*. The desire for ""extraordinary pain"" is the *reason* for suicide, not a *method* of suicide. There is no indication of a concrete plan or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current thoughts and a future-oriented intention (""I'm starting to think,"" ""I need to leave"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end (""suicide is the only thing,"" ""I need to leave""). This rules out 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out suicide. While there's a strong desire to act (""I need to leave""), the *how* is completely absent. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal intent without a specific plan or method.

I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed. The thought makes me so happy. Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy. I take great solace knowing that this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon. I'm saying this on reddit because if I were to share this with people in real life they'd try to stop me and I don't want anyone to take this away from me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""practicing hanging myself,"" ""finally do it,"" ""deserves to die,"" ""thinking of death,"" ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon."" The specific method ""hanging myself"" is mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My life is fucked,"" ""worthless trash,"" ""pain and this fucking shit life.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I've been practicing hanging myself,"" ""keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct,"" ""I will succeed."" This clearly indicates preparation and a specific method.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've been practicing hanging myself"" describes an ongoing, self-initiated preparatory action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""will be over soon,"" ""I will succeed."" High imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die, to end life. ""The thought makes me so happy. Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy."" ""I don't want anyone to take this away from me.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""hanging myself"" and expresses a clear desire to ""finally do it"" and for ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon.""
    *   There is no negation of the desire; it's affirmed strongly.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""hanging myself"") is mentioned.
    *   Yes, clear signs of preparation are present: ""I've been practicing hanging myself,"" ""keep practicing, train myself."" This is a direct action taken in preparation for the suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes an ongoing preparatory action (""I've been practicing"") and a future intention (""can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""will succeed,"" ""will be over soon"").
    *   The ""practicing"" is a self-initiated action towards a potentially lethal act. While not a full attempt, it is a concrete step of preparation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because it describes not only a specific method (""hanging myself"") but also *actions* being taken as preparation for that method (""I've been practicing,"" ""keep practicing, train myself""). This falls under the definition of 'Behavior' which includes ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations being taken.""
    *   It is not an 'Attempt' because 'Attempt' refers to a past or very recent *initiated action that was potentially lethal* with the intent to die at that moment. ""Practicing"" is a rehearsal or preparation for a future act, not a full, potentially lethal attempt itself.

Therefore, the post fits the 'Behavior' category due to the explicit suicidal intent, specific method, and ongoing preparatory actions.

My family always says its because she sees me as 'weak' because i was scared of dogs when we first got her. That makes me feel like absolute shit and its all i can think of every time this happens. Tonight it happened twice. the first time i screamed at her to shut up and the second time i screamed i would kill her and whipped a blanket at her. My mom was there and she said i scared her. I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about. I dont want to get into any relationships (not that i would anyway) because i can snap like this.

I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states, ""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" and ""one day i will take myself away from here."" The last phrase is a clear euphemism for suicide. There are no specific methods or means mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I know i'm a piece of shit,"" ""feel like absolute shit,"" ""I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about,"" ""I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them,"" ""I am on the edge."" These indicate severe self-loathing, guilt, fear of harming others, and being at a breaking point.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan (e.g., ""I'm going to take pills,"" ""I'm going to jump""), method, or preparations (e.g., ""writing a note,"" ""acquiring means"") are mentioned. ""Take myself away from here"" indicates an intention to end life, but not *how*.
    *   **References to past actions:** The post describes snapping at the dog, screaming, and whipping a blanket, which are not suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here."" ""Tonight"" indicates high imminence for the suicidal thoughts and potential action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire to die/disappear/end their life (""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I will take myself away from here""). This is not presented as an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I want to die"" and ""take myself away from here"" are direct expressions of a desire for death/to end life.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, unequivocally: ""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I will take myself away from here.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly expressed as personal intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. The phrase ""take myself away from here"" indicates the *outcome* (ending life) but not the *means* or *method*.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context. While there is high imminence (""tonight""), the phrasing ""take myself away from here"" is still too general to imply a specific method or plan. It's a statement of general intent to end life, not a description of *how* that will be done. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations."" The ""intended action"" here is to ""take myself away from here,"" which is the act of suicide itself, but it lacks the *how* that would elevate it to 'Behavior' without a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and future intentions (""I want to die,"" ""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The actions described (screaming at the dog, whipping a blanket) are not suicidal actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""take myself away from here""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (like a type of action, tool, or location) for carrying out suicide. While there's high imminence (""tonight""), the lack of *any* specific ""how"" (even vaguely implied beyond the general act of ending one's life) means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The phrase ""take myself away from here"" expresses the ultimate goal but not the means.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated potentially lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' because it expresses clear suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but without a specific plan or method.

I don't have any purpose in life to be honest. I don't know what will i do after college. I feel like disapointment. That's all. I just needed to vent. Sorry for my english.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""I don't want to exist."" It also contains the phrases ""Im not suicidal or something"" and ""I think that suicide is selfish.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""feel like trash,"" ""don't know what's wrong with me,"" ""don't know what to do anymore,"" ""no purpose in life,"" ""feel like disappointment,"" ""draining,"" ""anxiety attacks."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a sense of burden or lack of purpose.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide or self-harm.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The desire ""I just don't want to exist"" is stated as a current feeling, but it is immediately followed by a negation of suicidal intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire for non-existence (""I just don't want to exist"") but immediately and explicitly clarifies, ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish."" This indicates that while they are in severe distress and wish to escape their current state, they do not have a personal desire to die by suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""Im not suicidal or something."" and ""suicide is selfish.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? ""I just don't want to exist"" expresses a desire for non-existence. However, this is immediately and explicitly negated by ""Im not suicidal or something.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, the writer explicitly states ""Im not suicidal or something,"" directly negating personal suicidal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current feelings (""I feel like trash,"" ""I just don't want to exist"") and past circumstances (lockdown, studying).
    - No specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness (""feel like trash,"" ""no purpose in life,"" ""don't want to exist"").
    - While ""I just don't want to exist"" could, in isolation, be interpreted as ideation, the immediate and explicit statement ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish"" directly negates any personal suicidal intent or desire to act on such thoughts. The writer is expressing a wish to escape their current suffering, but explicitly states they are not suicidal.
    - This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die**"". The phrase ""I don't want to exist"" is a strong expression of distress, but the negation ""Im not suicidal"" clarifies that it does not represent a personal desire for suicide.
    - It is not 'Ideation' because the suicidal intent is explicitly negated.
    - It is not 'Behavior' as there is no plan, method, or preparation.
    - It is not 'Attempt' as no past initiated action is described.
    - Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'Indicator'.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hopelessness,"" ""despair,"" ""insanity,"" ""powerless state,"" ""worthlessness,"" ""sadistic.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""drafted my note thinking it was 'the least I could do for my friends and family'"" and ""without a finalized note"" in the context of the *past* attempt. No *current* plan or preparation for a *future* act is mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I attempted suicide last week,"" ""my attempt had failed."" This is a direct and clear description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The past attempt was ""last week."" The current state is ""back to square one"" with feelings of ""insanity and hopelessness,"" and a continued desire for death (""I want to take my life""). While there's current ideation, the most concrete action described is past.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die (""I truly dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""I want to take my life""). The thoughts of taking one's life are described as ""almost exhilarating.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""taking my life,"" and ""kill myself"" (implied by ""take my life"").
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die: ""I truly dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""I want to take my life.""
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they find them ""almost exhilarating.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific *current* plan, method, or preparation for a *future* act is mentioned.
    *   However, preparations (drafting a note) and an action (attempted suicide) are explicitly mentioned in the context of a *past* event (""last week"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a past event (""I attempted suicide last week,"" ""my attempt had failed"") and current feelings/ideation (""I want to take my life,"" ""back to square one"").
    *   It clearly describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past: ""I attempted suicide last week.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The most defining element of this post is the explicit description of a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: ""I attempted suicide last week.""
    *   According to the definitions, the 'Attempt' category takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation is also present. The attempt was very recent (""last week"") and is directly tied to the author's current feelings of being ""back to square one.""
    *   While there is strong current ideation (""I want to take my life""), the presence of the described past attempt makes 'Attempt' the most accurate classification.

    - There is no statement indicating these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they are presented as a personal desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - A specific method (""valium"") is mentioned.
    - The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" is not just a plan or preparation; it indicates an *action* of taking the substance has already been initiated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past action: ""I haven't taken enough"" clearly refers to an action that has already occurred.
    - It describes a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author: Taking valium with the intent to ""kill you"" is a self-initiated potentially lethal action. The user is evaluating if the initiated action was sufficient. This fits the definition of an initiated attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The presence of a clear desire to die (""I just want this nightmare to end"") combined with the explicit mention of a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (""I haven't taken enough"" of ""valium"" to ""kill you"") directly points to the 'Attempt' category. This is not merely ideation or planning; an action has already been taken.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods/means:** Explicitly states ""I don't want to live at all."" Mentions ""suicide attempts"" multiple times. Details specific past methods: ""swallowed every single one [Unisom sleeping pills],"" ""sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery"" with a straight razor, ""took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail."" Mentions ""suicide note.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't want to live at all,"" ""scared, it's like I just don't die."" - Indicates profound despair and a sense of being trapped in life despite wanting to die.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** For *past* events, yes: buying pills, swallowing them; writing a note; using a razor to slice; taking a prescription cocktail. No *current* or *future* specific plan/method/preparation is mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** Multiple detailed descriptions of past suicide attempts are provided, including specific dates/ages (""when I was 16,"" ""November 2020""). The motorcycle incident is described as an accident, not a suicide attempt, though the user links it to their inability to die.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire ""I don't want to live at all"" is present, but no immediate or imminent *new* action is stated. The focus is on past actions.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire not to live.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""suicide attempts.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/not be alive: ""I don't want to live at all.""
    *   No negation of these thoughts or desires.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   For *past* actions, there are very specific methods and preparations detailed (pills, razor, cocktail, suicide note).
    *   For *current* or *future* actions, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for a *new* suicidal act. The post is retrospective.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes multiple *past* events that are explicitly labeled as ""suicide attempts"" by the author.
    *   These descriptions include specific, potentially lethal actions initiated by the author: ""swallowed every single one,"" ""sliced hard and fast across my neck,"" ""took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail.""
    *   The attempts are described as historical (e.g., from when they were 16, and November 2020), but the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings (""I don't want to live at all,"" ""it's like I just don't die"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear suicidal ideation (""I don't want to live at all"").
    *   However, the most prominent and detailed aspect of the post is the description of multiple, specific, self-initiated past actions that the author explicitly identifies as ""suicide attempts.""
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes **past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal...** This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., ""many years ago"") if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    *   This post perfectly fits the 'Attempt' category due to the detailed recounting of past initiated suicidal actions. According to the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author.

    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""kill myself,"" ""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it,"" ""I just need someone to push me one more inch.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""All failing,"" ""feel my liver hurt,"" ""so stressed out,"" ""fucking everything up now,"" ""started crying."" High levels of hopelessness, despair, and feeling overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly describes a method and an initiated action: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight."" This is a clear description of a specific method (strangulation/hanging) and a location/circumstance.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This indicates a self-initiated action that was interrupted or stopped by the author themselves.
    *   **Imminence:** ""tonight,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it,"" ""I just need someone to push me one more inch."" High imminence for current/future intent, and the described action happened ""tonight.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself,"" ""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it."" There is a clear desire to die, coupled with a plea for intervention/reasons not to.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to ""be done"" and ""just doing it.""
    *   The writer is not stating these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they are seeking reasons *not* to act on them, implying a genuine desire to end their life.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""put a belt around my neck"") and action (""sat down against the doorknob in the closet"") were described and initiated. This goes beyond just a plan; it's an action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a very recent past event: ""tonight.""
    *   It describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was *initiated* by the author: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob... Right before I passed out, I stopped."" This clearly fits the definition of an initiated action, even though it was self-interrupted.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself,"" ""ready to be done""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It clearly describes a *self-initiated, potentially lethal action* (putting a belt around their neck and sitting down against a doorknob to induce unconsciousness), which was then stopped. This is not merely ideation or a plan; it is a concrete action that was started.
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' specifically includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death (e.g., 'I tried to hang myself today but I stopped right before passing out')."" The described event (""tonight,"" ""put a belt around my neck... Right before I passed out, I stopped"") perfectly matches this definition.
    *   Even though there's current high imminence and ideation, the core element described is a past initiated action, which takes precedence for classification as 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""too tired of life.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: The phrase ""too scared to kill myself"" indicates a barrier to action, suggesting a lack of immediate intent to act, despite the underlying desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""too tired of life"" strongly indicates a desire for life to end or not to be alive. While ""too scared to kill myself"" indicates a fear of acting on this, it does not negate the presence of the desire to die or suicidal thoughts. It's a struggle with the act, not a statement that the thoughts/desire are unwanted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself"" and ""suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""too tired of life.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states ""too scared to kill myself,"" which is a barrier to action, but not an explicit statement that they *do not want* the thoughts or the underlying desire to die. The desire to end life (""too tired of life"") is present.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - There is a desire to die/suicidal thoughts, but no indication of a plan, method, or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings (""scared,"" ""too tired"") and a hypothetical future consequence (""if i fail i might get arrested"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit mentions of ""kill myself"" and a clear desire for life to end (""too tired of life""). This goes beyond general distress and indicates personal suicidal thoughts/feelings. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. The statement ""too scared to kill myself"" further reinforces the lack of immediate intent to act or a plan. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive any longer, without any specific plan, method, or intended action mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""We start dying the second we are born"" (philosophical, not personal suicidal intent). ""This will be my second to last post."" (Strong implication of an impending end to the author's life/online presence). ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" (Clear intent to end life).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Fuck this fucking world,"" ""miserable lives,"" ""rotting away,"" ""human life has no fucking purpose,"" ""slowly decay."" These indicate extreme despair, hopelessness, and nihilism.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""This will be my second to last post."" - This is a clear preparatory statement, indicating an impending final act or departure from online presence linked to their intent.
        *   ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" - This describes a specific *plan* to take an action (""trip"") at a specific *time* (""April"") with the clear *purpose* of ending their life (""to end this bullshit for good""). While the *method* of the trip isn't specified (e.g., pills, jump), the *plan* to undertake an action for the purpose of suicide is explicit.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""April"" is a specific future date, indicating a planned action. ""Second to last post"" implies imminence for the online activity leading up to the event.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrases ""end this bullshit for good,"" coupled with the extreme despair and the planned action, clearly indicate a genuine wish to die and for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly using those exact words.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"" is a clear and direct expression of a desire for life to end by their own hand. The overall tone of despair reinforces this.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present and intended.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? ""Taking a trip"" is a planned action with a specific purpose (ending life) and a timeframe (""April""). While the *exact* method of suicide during this trip isn't stated, the *plan to undertake an action* for the purpose of suicide is explicit. This goes beyond mere ideation.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""This will be my second to last post"" is a clear sign of preparation/farewell. The mention of ""taking a trip"" itself implies preparation and logistics.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Here, the intent is high, and ""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"" is a planned action, not just a vague thought.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""taking a trip in April"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is clear, personal suicidal intent and a plan/preparation.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is ideation, there is also a clear plan (""taking a trip"") with a timeframe (""April"") and a preparatory statement (""second to last post""). This moves it beyond just thoughts/desire.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post expresses explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire (""end this bullshit for good"") AND mentions a plan (""taking a trip"") and preparations (""second to last post"") with a specific timeframe (""April""). Even though the *exact method* of suicide isn't detailed, the *plan to act* is clearly articulated.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past initiated action is described.

Based on the presence of clear suicidal intent, a stated plan with a timeframe, and preparatory statements, the post falls under 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything."" This mentions specific methods of dying (being hit by a car, overdosing on medication).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""no body cares,"" ""no motivation,"" ""fucked myself over,"" ""parents don't even care,"" ""no one left to turn to,"" ""don't feel like anything anymore it's just blank."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, isolation, and a sense of being a burden/failure.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** Specific methods are mentioned (""get hit by a car,"" ""od on meds""), but they are framed as a ""wish"" (""i just wish i could..."") rather than a concrete plan or intention to act. There are no signs of preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The phrase ""i just wish i could"" indicates a desire, not an immediate or planned action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die or for life to end, expressed through the wish for specific lethal events.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"" clearly expresses a desire for death.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as a personal wish.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"" are specific methods.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The methods are specific, but the framing (""i just wish i could"") indicates a strong desire/ideation *with* methods in mind, rather than a stated plan or intended action. The ""or anything"" further generalizes the desire for death. The post does not state an *intention* to act on these methods, only a *wish* for them to happen.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a wish for a future outcome (death).
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post goes far beyond general distress. It expresses a clear, personal desire for death (""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds""). This is a strong expression of suicidal ideation. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post expresses a desire to die and mentions specific methods (""hit by a car,"" ""od on meds""). However, the crucial distinction for 'Behavior' is the presence of a *plan, intended action, or preparation*. The phrase ""i just wish i could"" frames these methods as a desire or thought, not as a concrete plan or an immediate intention to carry out an action. While methods are present, the *intent to act* on them is not stated as a plan or preparation. If it were ""I'm going to overdose on meds"" or ""I'm planning to get hit by a car,"" it would be 'Behavior'. Given the ""wish"" phrasing, it falls short of a stated plan or intended action.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** There is no description of a past initiated action.

Based on this analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, including specific methods, but lacks a stated plan, intended action, or preparation to carry them out.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""self-harm,"" or specific methods. The phrase ""I would fucking jump out of bed every morning"" is an idiom for enthusiasm, not related to suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""daily torture of living life,"" ""Being unwanted in literally all facets of life,"" ""I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, and a deep dissatisfaction with their existence/life as it is.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** No.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No stated intentions to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses that living is ""daily torture"" and feels ""unwanted in literally all facets of life."" This indicates a strong desire for their current suffering to end, which implies a desire for life to end, even if not explicitly stated as ""I want to die."" The comparison to an attractive person's life (""I would never stop smiling I was born that way. I would fucking jump out of bed every morning"") highlights the stark contrast with their own perceived miserable existence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While not using ""I want to die,"" the phrase ""daily torture of living life"" strongly conveys a profound wish for their current state of existence to cease, which aligns with the definition of wanting life to end. It's a strong expression of profound dissatisfaction with being alive in their current condition.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts aren't explicitly mentioned as such, nor are they negated.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Not applicable, there is no high imminence or vague reference to action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a deep, ongoing state of despair.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound despair and describes ""living life"" as ""daily torture."" This goes beyond general distress and aligns with ""profound expressions of wanting life to end"" or desiring to not be alive, which is characteristic of 'Ideation'. It's not merely abstractly discussing suicide or expressing unwanted thoughts; it's a deep, personal expression of suffering related to their existence.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated potentially lethal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The intensity of ""daily torture of living life"" and ""being unwanted in literally all facets of life"" pushes this beyond mere 'Indicator' (general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts). It implies a personal desire for this suffering to cease, which is a form of wanting life to end.

Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' due to the profound expression of wishing their current miserable existence would end, without any specific plan or action.

    - Writer's stated desire: The post implies a history of suicidal ideation (""me being suicidal"") but the core of the post is about past actions and the invalidation experienced.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""me being suicidal"" and ""tried to kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? The phrase ""me being suicidal"" implies a personal history or ongoing state of suicidal ideation, but the primary focus is on past actions.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post does not negate the desire; it describes past actions.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, not for a *current* or *future* act. The mention of ""tried to kill myself"" refers to past actions without specific methods detailed.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for a *current* or *future* act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"") and expresses current frustration related to that history.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes, ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" clearly describes multiple past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a direct and explicit statement by the author about having initiated potentially lethal actions in the past (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"").
    - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    - The author is bringing up these past attempts in the context of their current feelings of being invalidated and their ongoing struggles (""abused and severely mentally ill"").
    - While the post also implies current or historical ideation (""me being suicidal""), the explicit mention of *initiated actions* takes precedence for classification as 'Attempt'.

103,bruh. they always say if something/someone makes you sad then you're better off without them right? but when i say i'm better off dead everyone's like no don't do that :D,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The phrase ""I'm better off dead"" is a direct expression of a desire for death. The reaction ""no don't do that"" from others implies they interpret this as suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Sad"" is mentioned, and ""better off dead"" indicates profound despair and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions or attempts are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is provided. It's a general statement of feeling.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states ""I'm better off dead,"" which is a clear personal desire to die or for life to end. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or not genuinely held by the author.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases, but ""I'm better off dead"" is a very strong and direct expression of a desire to die.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'm better off dead"" clearly indicates this.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer does not negate the desire. The post contrasts their feeling with others' reactions, implying a genuine personal sentiment.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a vague reference to action implying a method or plan in context with high imminence? No, there is no mention of action, and no high imminence.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current feeling/intention (""I'm better off dead"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""I'm better off dead""). This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide.
    *   There is no negation of this desire; it is presented as the author's personal feeling.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago,"" which is a specific method (overdose) and means (paracetamol, specific quantity). It also uses ""overdose help please"" and ""survive an od like this."" The phrase ""I did this to myself after all"" links the action to the author.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""sorry,"" ""don't know where else to post/ask this,"" ""my stomach is hurting very badly,"" ""sweating badly and shaking too,"" ""I feel like a burden."" These indicate significant distress and physical symptoms.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post describes an action that *already occurred*: ""took 44 paracetamol."" This is not a future plan but a past initiated action.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" is a direct statement of a recent, self-initiated action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The action happened ""almost an hour ago,"" indicating extreme recency.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer states ""i dont think i want to die but something is stopping me cllng 999."" This indicates ambivalence *after* the action has been taken, but the action itself was potentially lethal and self-initiated. The primary focus of the post is the consequence of this initiated action and seeking help for it.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? The user explicitly states ""i dont think i want to die"" *now*, but this is after taking a potentially lethal dose of medication. The act of taking 44 paracetamol, coupled with ""overdose help"" and ""did this to myself,"" strongly implies an intent to harm oneself, even if the desire to die is now wavering. The post is a consequence of an action that was initiated.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The user states a current lack of desire to die, but the action has already occurred. The post is about the aftermath of an initiated action.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""44 paracetamol"" is a specific substance and quantity. The action of taking them has already occurred.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The action itself is described as completed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a very recent past event: ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago."" The current state (stomach hurting, sweating, shaking) is a direct consequence of this past action.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes, ""took 44 paracetamol"" is a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.
    *   This clearly fits the definition of an 'Attempt' as a ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated action by the author that was potentially lethal.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post unequivocally describes a self-initiated, potentially lethal action (""took 44 paracetamol"") that occurred very recently (""almost an hour ago""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.
    *   Even though the author expresses ambivalence about wanting to die *now*, the critical factor for 'Attempt' is that a concrete, potentially life-threatening action was *initiated*. The post is a plea for help *after* this action.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because a specific, potentially lethal action was taken, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because a specific action was taken, not just thoughts or desire without action/plan.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because the action has already occurred, it's not a future plan or preparation.
    *   'Attempt' takes precedence when a past initiated action is clearly described.

105,"I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The phrase ""I want to end it"" is a direct expression of wanting life to end, which signifies suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Implies deep despair and a desire for cessation of existence.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else."" This is a clear indication that there is *no* plan, method, or preparation identified by the author.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I want to end it"" indicates a current desire. However, the lack of ""how"" or ""when"" suggests a lack of immediate actionable plan, reducing the imminence of an *action*.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, stated desire for life to end. It is not expressed as an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** ""I want to end it"" is a direct expression of a desire for life to end, which is synonymous with suicidal intent. (Yes)
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, ""I want to end it."" (Yes)
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the desire is stated as a personal wish.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** No. The post explicitly states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else.""
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan?** The imminence is present in the desire, but the explicit statement ""I have no idea how, when or anything else"" directly negates any implied method or plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes a current desire/intention.
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to end life (""I want to end it""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's more than general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a direct statement of suicidal desire.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" meaning there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does not describe any past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die, but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""sick and tired of this vicious cycle of highs and lows,"" ""can't handle it anymore,"" ""don't know what to do with myself,"" ""feel like a robot,"" ""feel nothing and like I'm overloading,"" ""exhausted,"" ""hopeless."" These indicate significant distress, anhedonia, and a feeling of being overwhelmed and unable to cope.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""It's been a year since I last posted here and I'm in the exact same situation."" This suggests a recurring pattern of distress but does not mention any past suicidal *actions*.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No stated intentions, therefore no imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses profound distress and a feeling of being unable to cope (""can't handle it anymore,"" ""don't know what to do with myself,"" ""exhausted,"" ""hopeless""). They lament not being able to ""enjoy my life"" and refer to their ""jackass of a brain"" preventing it. There is no explicit desire to die or for life to end. The distress is about their current state and inability to cope.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. While there's intense distress and hopelessness (""can't handle it anymore,"" ""hopeless""), there is no direct statement like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't here,"" or ""I want it to be over."" The focus is on the difficulty of living and coping, not a desire for death.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a desire to die with high imminence implying a vague action? No explicit desire to die, and no high imminence or implied action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of profound distress and a recurring pattern of ""highs and lows.""
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed and unable to cope.
    *   It *lacks* any clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or explicit suicidal intent. Phrases like ""can't handle it anymore"" or ""I'm exhausted"" signify severe distress and burnout, but not a direct wish for death.
    *   There is no mention of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted), plans, methods, preparations, or past initiated actions.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and hopelessness without explicit suicidal ideation or intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** The phrase ""once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death"" is present. However, this is presented as a general philosophical statement about hitting rock bottom, not a personal expression of suicidal intent or desire for death. There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post mentions feeling ""lonely and lost as ever and not knowing what to do wit my life."" It also expresses fear of being manipulative (""scares me sometimes bc ion wan be that person""). However, these are balanced by positive indicators: ""overall better compared to the rest of my life,"" ""feel more like myself,"" ""starting to accept who i am,"" ""in therapy again btw so it might get better for me,"" and encouraging others to ""find a way to stay positive and stay safe.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** The user describes their ""rock bottom"" as ""having really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday for nearly 2 years."" This describes a period of severe mental distress and behavioral issues, but not a suicidal act.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** No intentions are stated, thus no imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a desire for improvement (""it might get better for me,"" ""always a way to improve on something"") and explicitly states they don't want to be a manipulative person (""ion wan be that person""). The mention of ""death"" is not a personal desire but a general observation about the lowest point.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. The phrase ""nothing lower but death"" is a general statement about the nature of hitting rock bottom, not a personal desire for death. The overall sentiment is one of coping and improvement.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied for a suicidal act.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no vague reference to action implying a method or plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes past struggles (""my rock bottom was..."") and current/future efforts towards improvement (""i'm in therapy again btw so it might get better for me,"" ""these last 2 years since i've been way better tho"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author. The ""rock bottom"" description details mental breakdowns and nearly being abusive, not a suicidal attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses general distress (""lonely and lost,"" ""not knowing what to do wit my life"") and references past severe mental health struggles.
    *   Crucially, it *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author*. The only mention of ""death"" is a philosophical statement about hitting rock bottom, not a personal wish.
    *   The overall tone is one of self-awareness, seeking help (therapy), and finding ways to improve and stay positive.
    *   There are no suicidal thoughts expressed, no plans, no methods, and no past suicidal actions described by the author.
    *   This fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and discusses difficult experiences, but without personal suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods: ""ending it soon"" (euphemism for suicide), ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" (specific method).
    - Emotional indicators: ""overwhelmed by guilt,"" ""i don't know what else to do,"" ""pain scares me too much.""
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""overdosibg on ibuprofen...thats likely my go-to plan."" This is a clear, specific method and plan.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""soon,"" ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon."" This indicates a current and near-future intention, despite some hesitation due to fear of pain.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""plan on ending it soon."" This is a clear desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""ending it soon"" clearly conveys suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""plan on ending it soon.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer states a *plan* to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" is explicitly stated as the ""go-to plan.""
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation mentioned, but the *plan* is clearly articulated.
    - The explicit desire to die (""plan on ending it soon"") combined with a specific method (""overdosing on ibuprofen"") strongly indicates a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""plan on ending it soon,"" ""tonight or this week"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""plan on ending it soon""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts by explicitly stating a specific method (""overdosing on ibuprofen"") and calling it a ""go-to plan."" This moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a *past initiated action* (attempt), so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    - The presence of a clear desire to die and a stated specific plan/method fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** The post explicitly states, ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself."" This includes a direct mention of suicide and a specific method (gun).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I feel like shit,"" ""not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future,"" ""some people are born/meant to be fucked up."" These indicate profound distress, hopelessness, and self-deprecating thoughts.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method (""gun"") is mentioned in relation to the suicidal intent. While the action is conditional (""If I had a gun""), the method itself is clear. No preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I Relapsed After Almost Two Years."" This refers to a past addiction relapse, not a past suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence:** The distress is current (""now I feel like shit"") and anticipated to worsen (""not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future""). The desire to act is immediate *if* the means were available.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I'd kill myself"" clearly expresses a personal desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'd kill myself"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them. The desire is presented as a direct consequence of their current state.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""gun"") is mentioned in relation to a suicidal act.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   The explicit desire to die (""I'd kill myself"") combined with the mention of a specific method (""gun"") moves this beyond pure ideation, even if conditional. The presence of a concrete method in mind, linked to the intent, fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past event (relapse) leading to current distress and a current/future conditional intention to act (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"").
    *   It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to clear, personal suicidal intent and mention of a specific method.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because a specific method (""gun"") is mentioned in conjunction with the desire to die. Ideation is defined as *without* any specific plan, method, or intended action.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. There is an explicit personal expression of suicidal desire (""I'd kill myself"") AND a specific method (""gun"") is mentioned. While the action is conditional on having the gun, the *method* is clearly articulated as part of the suicidal thought process, indicating a step beyond mere abstract ideation. The definition states ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action."" The mention of a ""gun"" fulfills the ""specific method"" criterion.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past initiated suicidal action is described.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""My suicidal thoughts worse,"" ""I just wanna kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Distress, fear (of lung cancer), hopelessness, feeling unheard/ridiculed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None. No mention of how they would ""kill myself.""
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire to ""kill myself"" is conditional on a future event (""before I have to see him or myself get it""), not immediate.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to ""kill myself"" to avoid a feared future outcome. This is not presented as an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just wanna kill myself.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to ""kill myself"" is expressed as a personal wish.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Imminence is not high; the desire is conditional on a future event. There is no vague reference to action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a future-oriented desire (""before I have to see him or myself get it"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I just wanna kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator' as it's not general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without any specific plan, method, or intended action.

111,My last time posting on this account. I've got a suicide plan. Hello. I've finally got a plan on how i can kill myself and after thinking it over i'm pretty sure this will work. I plan on doing it next week and i'm excited to finally move on from this worthless existence. These past years have shit and i hope I don't get cold feet. Goodbye reddit thanks for the support and thanks for listening.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself,"" ""move on from this worthless existence,"" ""Goodbye reddit.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""worthless existence,"" ""shit"" (referring to past years), ""excited to finally move on,"" ""hope I don't get cold feet.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Explicitly states ""I've got a suicide plan"" and ""finally got a plan on how i can kill myself."" The phrase ""My last time posting on this account"" and ""Goodbye reddit"" indicate preparation/farewell. While the *details* of the plan are not disclosed, the *existence* of a plan is clearly stated.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""next week."" This is a specific, near-future timeframe.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear and strong desire to die and end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide plan"" and ""kill myself.""
    - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""excited to finally move on from this worthless existence"").
    - No negation of suicidal thoughts or desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - A specific method, tool, substance, or location is not detailed, but the post explicitly states the *existence* of ""a suicide plan"" and ""a plan on how i can kill myself."" This is a key element for 'Behavior'.
    - Signs of preparation are present: ""My last time posting on this account,"" ""Goodbye reddit,"" which suggest a farewell or tying up loose ends.
    - The explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present, and the imminence is high (""next week""). The explicit mention of ""a plan"" and ""preparations"" (farewell) strongly points to Behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a future intention: ""plan on doing it next week.""
    - It does not describe a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere ideation because it explicitly states the existence of ""a suicide plan"" and ""a plan on how i can kill myself,"" along with signs of preparation (""My last time posting,"" ""Goodbye reddit""). This moves it into 'Behavior'.
    - It describes a future plan/intention, not a past initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification as it includes explicit suicidal intent, a stated plan, and indications of preparation.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""suicidal thoughts"" (current and past), ""attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" No specific methods for current thoughts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Feeling bad,"" ""not sure how to proceed,"" ""long history of depression,"" ""pushed me back down,"" ""massive amounts of pain,"" ""can hardly move,"" ""can't even get dressed,"" ""feel terrible,"" ""feel like a piece of crap,"" ""emotional cheating,"" ""feel bad."" Indicates significant distress, pain, and guilt.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None for current suicidal thoughts. The focus is on seeking help and confiding in others.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This is a clear statement of a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""begun having those thoughts again."" No immediate imminence for acting on these thoughts; the stated intention is to ""try"" to follow through with appointments for help.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The return of ""suicidal thoughts"" indicates a presence of ideation. However, the primary desire expressed is to seek help and manage distress, not to act on the thoughts. The past attempt is a factual statement.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""attempted suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? ""begun having those thoughts again"" implies the return of ideation, but the overall context is seeking help, not expressing a current desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not explicitly, but the action of seeking help implies a desire to manage or overcome them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, not for current intentions.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        *   Past event: ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This is a clear description of a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.
        *   Current/future intention: ""begun having those thoughts again"" (current ideation), ""seeking help,"" ""set up appointments,"" ""I am going to try"" (future action of seeking help).
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes, ""attempted suicide in the past."" This fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago).""
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., ""many years ago"") if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    *   The author clearly brings up the past attempt in the context of their current struggles (""I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again"").
    *   Even though there is current ideation (""begun having those thoughts again""), the rule states: ""**'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author**, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.""
    *   Therefore, the presence of a clearly described past suicide attempt by the author makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate classification.

In which case I think I would go insane. I have so many issues that I don't tell anyone and I've never felt like that's been an option for me. I don't even open up to my best friends about my depression and thoughts of sh. I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best. It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm). It also states, ""I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best."" This indicates a history or tendency towards self-harm as a coping mechanism.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""I can't socialize well,"" ""suffering,"" ""afraid he won't want baggage like me and leave,"" ""I think I would go insane,"" ""so many issues,"" ""never felt like that's been an option,"" ""It's getting to be too much."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, isolation, and feeling overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The mention of ""cut"" is in the context of a *blocked coping mechanism*, not a current suicidal plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""thoughts of sh"" and ""I can't even cut"" suggest a history of self-harm. This is presented as a coping mechanism, not explicitly a past *suicidal attempt*.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""It's getting to be too much"" indicates increasing distress but no immediate suicidal intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses profound distress and feeling overwhelmed, but there is no explicit statement of wanting to die, wanting life to end, or suicidal intent. The focus is on suffering and inability to cope.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. Phrases like ""I think I would go insane"" and ""It's getting to be too much"" convey extreme emotional pain and feeling overwhelmed, but not a direct desire for death or to end life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The post mentions ""thoughts of sh"" but does not explicitly state they are unwanted or that the writer doesn't want to act on them. However, it also does not state a *desire* to act on them for suicidal purposes, nor a desire for death. The context is distress and coping.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The mention of ""cut"" is in the context of self-harm as a coping mechanism that is currently unavailable, not a suicidal plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and struggles (""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""I'm suffering,"" ""It's getting to be too much""). It refers to ""thoughts of sh"" and the inability to ""cut"" as a coping mechanism, implying a past history of self-harm.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The self-harm (cutting) is presented as a coping mechanism, not a past *suicidal attempt* (i.e., an initiated action with suicidal intent). The post does not say ""I attempted suicide"" or ""I tried to kill myself by cutting.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and difficulty coping.
    *   It mentions ""thoughts of sh"" and the inability to use self-harm as a coping mechanism. While self-harm can be a risk factor for suicide, the post itself does not express explicit suicidal intent or a desire to die. The self-harm is framed as a coping mechanism, not a suicidal act.
    *   There is no explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire for life to end.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
    *   There is no description of a past *suicidal attempt* (an initiated, potentially lethal action with suicidal intent).

    Based on the definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** This category fits best. The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and mentions self-harm (which is a risk factor) but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The ""thoughts of sh"" are not explicitly stated as unwanted, but they are also not framed as a desire to die or a suicidal plan. The primary sentiment is being overwhelmed and unable to cope.
    *   **Ideation:** Not applicable, as there is no explicit desire to die or suicidal intent expressed.
    *   **Behavior:** Not applicable, as there is no plan, method, or intended action for suicide.
    *   **Attempt:** Not applicable, as no past initiated suicidal action is described.

Therefore, the post falls under 'Indicator' due to the high level of distress and mention of self-harm thoughts without explicit suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""when I die,"" ""my pain is finally over,"" ""if I'm dead.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""pain is finally over,"" ""happy"" (in the context of death), implying severe distress and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""when I die"" suggests a future event, but the underlying sentiment is a strong, current desire for death as the only solution.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear, personal desire for death as the only way to achieve happiness and end pain.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but it directly discusses the author's own death as a desired outcome (""when I die,"" ""if I'm dead"").
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."" This is a very clear expression of wanting life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire for death is presented as the only solution and a desired state.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. In this case, there is no reference to any action, only to the state of being dead.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire leading to a future state (""when I die"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not abstract distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a direct desire for death.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for carrying out the desire to die. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end, but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""don't want to live"", ""take the leap"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""don't care about anything anymore"", ""life is all downhill"", ""career dreams are ruined"", ""never have kids"", ""nothing in my life"". These convey profound hopelessness and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""take the leap"" implies a method/action, though metaphorical (often associated with jumping). ""finally decided to take the leap"" indicates a decision to act. ""goodbye"" is a clear preparation/farewell.
    - References to past actions: ""you guys helped me stay here about a month longer"" refers to past support, not a past suicidal action.
    - Imminence: ""finally decided"", ""goodbye"". This indicates a current decision and imminent intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die and end life: ""kill myself"", ""don't want to live"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Explicitly mentions ""kill myself"": Yes.
    - Expresses clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end: Yes (""don't want to live"", ""don't care about anything anymore"").
    - Does the writer explicitly state they do not want these thoughts or actions? No, the opposite is true; they state a decision to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? ""take the leap"" is a metaphorical phrase for a suicidal act, often implying jumping. While not a concrete method like ""pills"" or ""gun,"" it represents a decided-upon action. The phrase ""finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"" signifies a firm intention to act.
    - Are there signs of preparation? ""goodbye"" is a strong sign of preparation/farewell.
    - Given the high imminence (""finally decided"") and explicit intent (""kill myself""), ""take the leap"" functions as an intended action, even if vague in its specific physical manifestation. Combined with ""goodbye,"" this moves beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current decision and future intention (""finally decided to take the leap"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and a decision to act.
    - Not 'Ideation' because the post goes beyond just thoughts or desires. It states a ""finally decided"" intention to act (""take the leap and kill myself"") and includes a clear preparation (""goodbye"").
    - This fits the 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die... AND also mentions... an intended action (even if the method is vague, like 'want to make the pain physical,' especially if coupled with high imminence), or preparations being taken."" ""Take the leap"" is an intended action, and ""goodbye"" is a preparation.
    - Not 'Attempt' because it describes a current decision and intention to act, not a past initiated action.

The combination of a decided intention to act (""finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"") and a clear sign of preparation/farewell (""goodbye"") strongly indicates 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" ""it's finally ending,"" ""22 years on this earth was enough for me,"" ""Goodbye."" These phrases clearly indicate a desire to end life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""feel so relaxed that it's finally ending"" - this suggests acceptance and peace about the impending end, which is a concerning sign in this context.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned. However, ""Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all"" and ""Playing witcher 3 before i call it quits"" strongly imply a *final act* or *preparation* before the intended action. The ""one last time"" and ""Goodbye"" are explicit signs of farewell and preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""one last time before i end it all,"" ""before i call it quits,"" ""it's finally ending."" This indicates very high imminence, suggesting the action is planned for very soon.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and explicit desire for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" ""it's finally ending,"" and ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"" are unequivocal expressions of a desire to die/end life.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, clearly.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses feeling ""relaxed"" about it ""finally ending,"" indicating acceptance and intent.
    - Conclusion: Clear and explicit desire to die/end life.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No specific method or location is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all"" is a clear preparatory act, a final farewell activity. The ""Goodbye"" message is also a strong sign of preparation/farewell before an intended act. These are not merely thoughts but actions taken in anticipation of ending life.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The imminence is very high. The ""one last time"" activity and ""Goodbye"" are concrete preparatory behaviors.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""before i end it all,"" ""before i call it quits"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - 'Ideation' is ruled out because beyond just expressing a desire to die, there are clear signs of preparation and a final farewell (""Playing my favourite video game one last time,"" ""Goodbye""). These are more than just thoughts; they are actions being taken in anticipation of the suicidal act.
    - 'Behavior' fits because the post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions preparations being taken (""one last time"" activity, ""Goodbye""). Even without a specific method, these preparatory actions, coupled with high imminence and clear intent, classify it as Behavior.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past initiated action is described. The post refers to future intent with current preparations.

Therefore, the post best fits the 'Behavior' category due to the explicit intent to end life, the high imminence, and the clear preparatory actions/farewells mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post states ""She wrote three days ago that she had tried to kill herself"". This refers to another person, not the author.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I need help,"" ""I'm scared,"" ""pls tell me how do I know if she is ok?"" These indicate distress and concern, but for another individual.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned for the author.
    - References to past actions: ""She had tried to kill herself"" is a past action, but by ""She,"" not the author.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not applicable to the author's own suicidal intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses concern and fear for another person's well-being, not a personal desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:

    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No, not from the author. The author is expressing concern for someone else.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as the thoughts/actions are not the author's.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:

    - Are there signs of preparation *by the author*? No.

    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event involving another person (""She had tried to kill herself"") and the author's current distress/concern about that person.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated *by the author* in the past? No. The action was initiated by ""She.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The crucial rule is ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    - The author of this post is expressing general distress and concern (""I need help,"" ""I'm scared"") about another person's past suicidal attempt and current status.
    - There is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past attempt by the author of the post.
    - The post fits the definition of 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress and discusses suicide abstractly (in relation to another person), but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I will hang myself now."" ""something that I can tie and that will kill me with it."" ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore."" The method ""hang myself"" is specific.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't want to be alone anymore,"" ""makes me sick,"" ""scared to go out,"" ""nobody has ever liked me,"" ""made fun of me and used me."" These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""I will hang myself now"" states a clear intention and method. ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it"" describes an active search for means, which is a form of preparation. ""I don't think the thing will break off as I am only 44kg"" shows consideration of the method's effectiveness.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" indicates a history of self-harm, but not a past *suicide attempt*.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""now,"" ""I'm now looking."" This indicates high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die and end life (""I will hang myself now,"" ""that will kill me with it"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I will hang myself now,"" ""that will kill me with it.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states intent to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""hang myself"" is a specific method. ""looking for something that I can tie"" is a specific tool/means being sought.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie"" is an active step of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention (""I will hang myself now"") and current active preparation (""I'm now looking""). It mentions past self-harm, but not a past *suicide attempt*.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, it describes a *current* intention and *current* search for means, not a completed or interrupted past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I will hang myself now,"" ""that will kill me with it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts by mentioning a specific method (""hang myself"") and active steps of preparation (""I'm now looking for something that I can tie""). This clearly moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   The post describes a current intention to act and active steps being taken (searching for means) to carry out a plan. It does not describe a past initiated action. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior'. 'Attempt' would require a description of a past initiated action.

It feels like I am being ripped apart and put back together incorrectly. I can't stop shaking. How am I supposed to live like this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The post contains the phrase ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" which is an explicit negation of a desire to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""shattered,"" ""shitty,"" ""miserable,"" ""sucks,"" ""barely function,"" ""ripped apart and put back together incorrectly,"" ""can't stop shaking,"" ""How am I supposed to live like this?"" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and functional impairment.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** Not applicable as no suicidal intent is expressed.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This is a clear statement that they do *not* have a desire to die, despite their profound suffering.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No, it explicitly negates this desire (""It's not even that I just want to die"").
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, the writer explicitly states they do not want to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Not applicable as there is no explicit desire to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings of severe distress.
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses intense emotional pain, hopelessness, and difficulty functioning. This indicates significant distress.
    *   However, the crucial phrase ""It's not even that I just want to die"" directly negates any personal suicidal intent or desire to die.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   **Indicator:** ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die..."" This aligns perfectly with the post, as the author is in distress but explicitly states they do not want to die.
        *   **Ideation:** Requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end."" This is explicitly contradicted by the author's statement.
        *   **Behavior:** Requires Ideation plus a plan/method/intended action. Not applicable.
        *   **Attempt:** Requires a past initiated action. Not applicable.
    *   Therefore, despite the severe distress, the explicit negation of suicidal desire places this post in the 'Indicator' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""I just want to kill myself."" Also, ""I want out now"" and ""I want out"" imply a desire to end life. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Hate this rat race,"" ""overwork me,"" ""can't handle it,"" ""don't see the need,"" ""Tf is this life?"" - indicate high levels of distress, despair, and hopelessness related to work and life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No references to past self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I want out now"" suggests a strong, immediate desire to escape, but it's a desire for an outcome, not a specific action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, explicit, and personal desire to die (""I just want to kill myself"") and for life to end (""I want out now,"" ""I want out""). This is not presented as an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I just want to kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just want to kill myself,"" ""I want out now,"" ""I want out.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a personal wish.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. While ""I want out now"" has high imminence, it does not imply a *method* or *plan* for suicide; it's a statement of desire for an outcome. There's no ""I'm going to do X"" or ""I'm thinking of Y method.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire/intention (""I just want to kill myself,"" ""I want out now"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I just want to kill myself,"" ""I want out""). This rules out 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal suicidal intent, and the thoughts are not stated as unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for carrying out suicide. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated potentially lethal action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die and suicidal thoughts without any specific plan, method, or action. This perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (misspelling of die), ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""suicidal courage and determination,"" ""don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""DEPRESSED,"" ""frightened,"" ""coward,"" ""Everyone hates themselves.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem"" - This suggests specific tools and an intended destructive action.
        *   ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also."" - This is a very specific method, including preparation steps (learning, researching parts).
        *   ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best."" - This identifies a specific location and implies an intended destructive action there.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** The post starts with a clear desire (""I WANT TO DOIE"") but then shifts to a cynical dismissal of the author's own ability to act (""You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward""). However, immediately following this, the post provides highly detailed instructions for *how* to act ""If you change your mind and you want to do it."" This suggests a detailed plan is being considered or articulated, even if the author views themselves as currently lacking the courage to execute it. The detailed instructions are for a future, hypothetical but clearly articulated, action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I WANT TO DOIE"" is a direct expression of desire to die. While the post then self-deprecatingly states ""You will never do it,"" the subsequent detailed instructions for *how* to ""do it"" if one *does* decide to, indicate that the desire and the ideation of *how* to act are present.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (die) is an explicit desire to die.
    *   ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   The post does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, it dismisses the author's own courage to act on them, but then immediately provides detailed methods *if* they were to act. This is not an ""unwanted thoughts"" scenario.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, multiple specific methods, tools, and locations are mentioned:
        *   ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"" for ""mayhem"" (linked to ""go out with a bang"").
        *   ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home,"" ""research where to find the parts for cheap."" This is a highly specific method and preparation.
        *   ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best."" This is a specific location for an intended destructive action.
    *   These are concrete details that go beyond vague ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings (""DEPRESSED,"" ""I WANT TO DOIE"") and future, hypothetical but detailed, intentions/actions (""If you change your mind and you want to do it... Learn how to make nitroglycerin... Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants..."").
    *   No past initiated actions are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""I WANT TO DOIE"") and explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post goes far beyond mere thoughts or desires by providing highly specific details about methods (nitroglycerin, wire cutters), tools (ladders, wire cutters), and locations (power plants) for carrying out a destructive, potentially lethal act, linked to the idea of ""going out with a bang."" This level of detail about *how* to act, even if presented hypothetically (""If you change your mind...""), constitutes a plan or method. This rules out 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Behavior' because it includes explicit suicidal intent and detailed mentions of a plan, method, or preparations for carrying out a suicidal or highly destructive act.

122,"Bully payback help. My best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesn't even know. Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now.

With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post directly quotes the bully telling the friend to ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself"" and threatening ""when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you."" These are threats/statements *from the bully to the friend*, not expressions of suicidal intent by the author or the friend.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author states their friend is ""mentally disturbing,"" ""constantly tired,"" ""overwhelmed,"" and ""isn't doing well."" The author is trying to get the friend to ""eat and go out and do stuff but she won't."" These indicate significant distress and potential depression in the friend.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** None mentioned for the author or the friend.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned for the author or the friend.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No suicidal intentions are stated.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer (author of the post) is seeking advice on how to help their friend and potentially expose the bully. Their desire is to assist their friend and seek justice, not to die or self-harm. The friend's desire is not explicitly stated as suicidal; rather, she is described as being severely distressed by the bullying.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""go kill yourself"" is mentioned, but it's a quote of the bully's words to the friend, not an expression of personal suicidal intent by the author or the friend.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. While the friend is described as severely distressed (""mentally disturbing,"" ""overwhelmed,"" ""not doing well""), there is no explicit statement of a desire to die or for life to end from the friend or the author.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not expressed by the author or the friend.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific plan, method, tool, substance, location, or preparation related to suicide is mentioned or implied for the author or the friend.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes an ongoing situation of bullying affecting the friend. There are no descriptions of past, current, or future suicidal actions by the author or the friend.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes a friend experiencing severe emotional distress due to bullying. Symptoms like being ""constantly tired,"" ""not eating,"" and ""not doing well"" are indicators of distress.
    *   The suicidal language (""go kill yourself"") is attributed to the bully, not the friend or the author. This is crucial; it's a threat/harassment, not an internal expression of suicidal desire.
    *   There is no explicit statement of suicidal thoughts or desire to die from the author or the friend.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
    *   There is no description of a past suicidal attempt.
    *   Therefore, the post expresses general distress and mentions suicide in an abstract context (as a threat from someone else), but lacks personal suicidal intent from the author or the friend. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""I want to hang myself so bad,"" ""how much longer I could last here on earth."" The specific method ""hang myself"" is explicitly stated.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""loser, ugly, no motivation, isolated,"" ""Alot of mental illness,"" ""pain,"" ""so alone,"" ""nothing to look forward to."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, low self-worth, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I want to hang myself so bad"" is a specific method. No explicit preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I have tried to reach out"" refers to past help-seeking, not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""suicide is on my mind everyday"" indicates persistent thoughts. ""I want to hang myself so bad"" indicates a strong, current desire. ""don't know how much longer I could last here on earth"" suggests a struggle to continue living. There is a small piece of hope, but it's presented as dwindling.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself,"" ""I want to hang myself so bad,"" ""don't know how much longer I could last here on earth""). The thoughts are not stated as unwanted; rather, the writer is struggling to find reasons *not* to act on them.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself,"" ""suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself,"" ""I want to hang myself so bad,"" ""don't know how much longer I could last here on earth.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is struggling *with* the desire, not stating that the thoughts are unwanted. The ""small piece of hope"" is a reason to hold on, not a negation of the desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""I want to hang myself so bad"" explicitly mentions ""hang myself"" as a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Here, the method is explicit, not vague.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current persistent thoughts (""suicide is on my mind everyday""), current strong desire for a specific method (""I want to hang myself so bad""), and future uncertainty about continuing to live.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, there is no mention of a past initiated attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""how much longer I could last here on earth""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Beyond just ideation, the post explicitly states a specific method: ""I want to hang myself so bad."" The presence of this specific method, coupled with the strong desire and persistent thoughts, moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does not describe any past or very recent *initiated action* (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself,"" ""I took pills""). Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit personal desire to die and the mention of a specific method (""hang myself""), the classification is 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/suicide/self-harm: ""still alive unfortunately,"" ""attempted once again,"" ""my 15th time,"" ""still want to attempt again,"" ""stay alive.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""unfortunately"" (implying a desire not to be alive), ""still want to attempt again"" (ongoing suicidal ideation/desire).
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No specific plan or method for a *future* attempt is detailed.
    - References to past actions: ""last night I attempted once again,"" ""this makes it like what my 15th time?"" These are clear descriptions of past, initiated suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: ""last night"" indicates a very recent past action. ""still want to attempt again"" indicates ongoing desire, but this is tempered by ""I found one thing to live for so I guess ill stay alive.""
    - Writer's stated desire: There's a clear desire to die (""still alive unfortunately,"" ""still want to attempt again"") alongside a new reason to live. However, the explicit description of past attempts is central.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""attempted"" and ""attempt again"" and expresses a desire not to be alive (""unfortunately"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific plan, method, or preparation for a *future* suicidal act is mentioned. The focus on action is on past events.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past event: ""last night I attempted once again,"" and refers to multiple past attempts (""my 15th time?"").
    - It clearly describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was *initiated* by the author in the past (""I attempted""). This directly fits the definition of an 'Attempt'. The recency (""last night"") reinforces this.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear statements of past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions: ""last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time?""
    - While there is also current ideation (""still want to attempt again""), the definition for 'Attempt' states: ""This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" And, crucially: ""**'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author**, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.""
    - Therefore, the most accurate classification based on the explicit description of initiated past actions is 'Attempt'.

125,"Check on me please. I'm at the end of my rope right now. Everything's crumbling and I don't see a reason as for why. I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting and I know this is going to be another failure, I'm still too scared to go all the way through. I know I'll wake up later, and while I know this, I want so badly to reach out to my friends and ask them to check up on me but I don't want to put them through something as scary as this. I don't want them to have to deal with me during this. I knew this morning the moment I woke up that it would lead to this. I've thought about it all day and throughout I've tried to be happy and loud so they wouldn't worry, so they wouldn't know what I was really thinking. I'm scared right now but I know I'll wake up. I'm sad right now and I want nothing more than someone to sit with me in silence while I cry. But I'm alone. I can't reach out. So all I ask is this, please check up on me later. I can feel myself falling asleep, but as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up. I just want to be checked up on, but I don't want to bother my friends with it. Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post uses phrases like ""end of my rope,"" ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting,"" ""go all the way through"" (implying dying), ""another failure"" (implying past attempts to die), ""I know I'll wake up"" (implying an action causing unconsciousness), ""I can feel myself falling asleep,"" and ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"" (clear desire to die). While no specific method is named, the physical symptoms and ""falling asleep"" strongly imply an ingested substance or similar action.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Everything's crumbling,"" ""don't see a reason,"" ""scared,"" ""sad,"" ""alone,"" ""can't reach out."" High levels of despair, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No explicit named method or preparation. However, the description of physical sensations (""breath slowing down,"" ""chest hurting,"" ""falling asleep"") strongly implies an *action* is ongoing or has just occurred, which is intended to lead to death (""go all the way through""). The phrase ""another failure"" and ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" confirms this is a repeated, initiated action.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I know this is going to be another failure"" and ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" These are explicit references to past self-initiated actions that were potentially lethal but failed.
    *   **Imminence:** ""right now,"" ""I feel my breath slowing down,"" ""falling asleep."" Very high imminence, indicating an action is ongoing or just completed.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"" clearly states a desire to die. The fear is of *failing* to die (""still too scared to go all the way through,"" ""another failure"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" Also, the context of ""go all the way through"" and ""another failure"" strongly implies a desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is acting on them and wishes for a lethal outcome.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? While not named, the physical sensations (""breath slowing down,"" ""chest hurting,"" ""falling asleep"") combined with the intent to ""go all the way through"" and the expectation of ""waking up"" because ""I've done this before"" strongly imply an *initiated action* (e.g., taking pills) that causes unconsciousness. This is more than just a plan; it's a description of an action being taken or just completed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Yes, the physical symptoms and the ""falling asleep"" are clear indicators of an *action* being taken.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        *   **Current/Ongoing Action:** ""I'm at the end of my rope right now,"" ""I feel my breath slowing down,"" ""I can feel myself falling asleep."" This describes an action that is happening *now* or has just happened.
        *   **Past Initiated Actions:** ""I know this is going to be another failure,"" and ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" These phrases explicitly state that the author has taken similar *actions* in the past that were potentially lethal but failed. This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""hope I don't wake up"").
    *   It describes an *ongoing physical action* (""breath slowing down,"" ""falling asleep"") that is intended to lead to death, even if the method is vague. This points towards 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the crucial element is the explicit mention of *past initiated actions* by the author that were potentially lethal but failed (""another failure,"" ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up""). The definition for 'Attempt' includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical... if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" The author is clearly bringing up these past attempts in the context of their current suicidal state and ongoing similar actions.
    *   Since the rules state that 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present, this post fits the 'Attempt' category best.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** Explicitly states ""intent to kill myself,"" ""I am going to shoot myself,"" ""I could die, or the attempt could fail,"" ""after I am done doing what I need to do,"" ""Goodbye."" A specific method is mentioned: ""loaded gun by my side,"" ""shoot myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""true failure,"" ""no more savings,"" ""my room is empty, everything is gone,"" ""Too late to turn back now!"", ""ran out of chances."" These convey extreme hopelessness, despair, and a sense of finality.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A clear method is stated (""loaded gun,"" ""shoot myself""). Significant preparations are described: ""Every other account is gone, deleted,"" ""no more savings,"" ""my room is empty, everything is gone."" This indicates severing ties and divesting possessions.
    *   **References to past actions:** The post mentions past *intent* (""Been writing here since June, with the intent to kill myself. I never did it.""). Crucially, it explicitly states that the action was *not* taken in the past (""I never did it"").
    *   **Imminence:** ""It's time,"" ""Not until now,"" ""not sure what will happen once I post this,"" ""I am not giving myself anymore chances,"" ""Too late to turn back now!,"" ""after I am done doing what I need to do."" High imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A very clear and resolute desire to die and end their life is expressed. There is no indication of unwanted thoughts; rather, there is a strong determination to act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""intent to kill myself"" and ""I am going to shoot myself.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die and for life to end, indicated by phrases like ""risk is worth the reward,"" ""it all doesn't matter to me,"" ""Too late to turn back now!,"" and the farewell message.
    *   The writer does *not* state they do not want these thoughts or actions; they are resolute in their intention.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""loaded gun,"" ""shoot myself"") is mentioned.
    *   Yes, signs of preparation are present: ""Every other account is gone, deleted,"" ""no more savings,"" ""my room is empty, everything is gone.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current and highly imminent future intention (""It's time,"" ""Not until now,"" ""I am going to shoot myself"").
    *   It explicitly states that past intent did *not* lead to action (""I never did it""). Therefore, it does *not* describe a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by including a specific method (""loaded gun,"" ""shoot myself"") and clear preparations (""deleted accounts,"" ""empty room,"" ""no savings""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   While it mentions past intent, it explicitly states no action was taken (""I never did it""). The core of the post is about a *current, imminent plan* to act, not a past initiated attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The combination of explicit suicidal intent, a specific plan/method, and significant preparations for a current/future action perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""tried to pass a week ago,"" ""suicide episode,"" ""leave a note for my parents saying its my last time with them,"" ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it,"" and ""thought that was the last breath i have."" The method (bleach) is specific.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depression,"" ""stress,"" ""feeling unappreciated,"" ""depressed middle child that would cry at midnight,"" ""suicidal episodes.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""leave a note for my parents,"" ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it."" These are clear preparations and a specific method/action.
    *   **References to past actions:** The entire core of the post is a detailed recounting of an event that happened ""a week ago"" where the author ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it."" This is a clear description of a past initiated action.
    *   **Imminence:** The described event occurred ""a week ago.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** At the time of the event, there was a clear desire to die (""its my last time with them,"" ""thought that was the last breath""). The author is now ""a little okay"" but reflecting on this past action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""suicide episode"" is mentioned.
    *   Yes, the actions described (""leave a note,"" ""swallowed bleach,"" ""thought that was the last breath"") clearly indicate a desire to die at the time of the event.
    *   The author states they usually ""overcome"" suicidal episodes, but this specific one led to an action, indicating the desire to die was present and acted upon during that episode.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""bleach"") and an action (""swallowed it"") are mentioned.
    *   Yes, preparation (""leave a note for my parents"") is mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past event (""a week ago"").
    *   It describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author: ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it."" The fact that they ""vomited"" and survived does not negate that a potentially lethal action was initiated.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it"") by the author, complete with preparation (leaving a note) and clear intent at the time. This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'.
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' explicitly states: ""This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" The author is sharing their story about ""what happened a week ago"" and linking it to their depression, even though they are ""doing better now.""
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because there is clear personal suicidal intent and a described action.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because there was a specific plan, method, and *initiated action*.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because 'Behavior' refers to *current/future* plans/intended actions, whereas this describes a *past initiated action*. 'Attempt' takes precedence when a past initiated action is clearly described.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""lost all will to live,"" ""I still want to die,"" ""the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child"" (implying their own death).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse,"" ""lost all will to live,"" ""still want to die,"" ""please help."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, and a desire for life to end.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I lost my sibling this year,"" ""After the funeral I basically lost all will to live,"" ""I tried to pull through and find things to do to occupy my time."" These refer to a life event and coping mechanisms, not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I still want to die"" indicates a current and ongoing desire.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, explicit desire to die (""I still want to die,"" ""lost all will to live""). The mention of parents is a protective factor preventing action, but it does not negate the underlying desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""lost all will to live,"" and ""I still want to die"" are clear expressions of a desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to die is stated as a current personal feeling, not an unwanted intrusive thought. The protective factor (parents) prevents action, but the desire itself is present.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a high imminence with vague reference to action? No, there is no reference to an intended action, only the desire.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (sibling's death) leading to a current, ongoing desire to die (""I still want to die"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear, current, personal desire to die (""I still want to die,"" ""lost all will to live""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for suicide. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated potentially lethal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post clearly fits the definition of 'Ideation' due to the explicit personal expression of a desire to die without a plan or action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""thinking of suicide for months on end."" It also mentions ""my end will only get nearer"" and ""I'm fine with either outcome,"" implying acceptance of death by suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""deepest depths of myself and darkest corners,"" ""deeper than I've ever been."" These indicate profound despair and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""take a few tabs of acid"" but clarifies this is to ""see what happens first,"" as an *alternative* or *last resort* before ""my end will only get nearer."" It is not presented as a method of suicide itself. There is no specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide mentioned (e.g., specific means, location, or preparatory actions like writing a note).
    *   **References to past actions:** ""This time I'm deeper than I've ever been"" implies past struggles with mental health, but not past *suicidal actions* or attempts.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** Suicidal thoughts have been present ""for months on end."" The ""end"" is described as ""nearer"" if the acid doesn't help, indicating a future, potentially imminent, intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states ""thinking of suicide"" and is ""fine with either outcome,"" which includes their ""end"" getting nearer. This clearly indicates a genuine desire for life to end or for suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""thinking of suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""my end will only get nearer"" and ""I'm fine with either outcome"" (referring to the possibility of death).
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer accepts the outcome of their ""end"" getting nearer.
    *   **Conclusion:** There is clear, explicit suicidal intent and desire. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The acid is mentioned as a potential coping mechanism or a test, not as the method for suicide. The ""end"" is implied but no *how* is specified.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   **Conclusion:** No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. This rules out 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current ongoing suicidal thoughts (""for months on end"") and a future intention (""my end will only get nearer"" if the acid doesn't work).
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No mention of any past suicide attempt or initiated action.
    *   **Conclusion:** No past initiated suicidal action is described. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end (""thinking of suicide for months,"" ""my end will only get nearer,"" ""fine with either outcome""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not describe general distress *without* suicidal intent (ruling out 'Indicator').
    *   It does not describe a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide (ruling out 'Behavior'). The acid use is presented as a last resort *before* the ""end,"" not the means of the ""end.""
    *   It does not describe a past initiated suicidal action (ruling out 'Attempt').

Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** No explicit mention of suicide, death, or self-harm in terms of ending life. The user mentions stealing hydrocodone and drinking alcohol, which are substances that *could* be used for self-harm or suicide, but the stated intent is ""just to feel ok for one night.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hit a new low tonight,"" ""havent felt ok in a while,"" ""im not sure what to do."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user describes taking hydrocodone (stolen from their dog) and drinking alcohol. This is a specific action involving substances. However, the *stated purpose* is ""just to feel ok for one night,"" not to end life. There are no plans for suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** The actions (stealing pills, drinking) happened ""tonight.""
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The distress is current (""new low tonight,"" ""not sure what to do""). The actions are happening now/tonight.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The desire is ""to feel ok for one night."" There is no stated desire to die, to not be alive, or for life to end. The user is expressing distress and a maladaptive coping mechanism.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The desire is to ""feel ok.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.
    *   Conclusion: There is no explicit suicidal intent. The distress is clear, and the actions are risky, but the stated motivation is self-medication for distress, not suicide.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Hydrocodone and alcohol are mentioned, but not in relation to a suicidal act. The purpose is explicitly stated as ""to feel ok.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for suicide. The preparation (stealing pills) is for the stated purpose of feeling okay.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Not applicable, as there is no explicit desire to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current actions (""tonight i stole,"" ""ive had a bit to drink tonight"") and current feelings (""hit a new low,"" ""havent felt ok in a while,"" ""not sure what to do"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? The user initiated taking the substances, but the intent was not lethal or suicidal. It was to ""feel ok."" Therefore, it does not qualify as a suicidal attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses general distress and a ""new low."" It describes risky behavior (misuse of prescription medication and alcohol) as a coping mechanism for this distress.
    *   Crucially, there is **no clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent.** The stated purpose of taking the substances is ""to feel ok,"" not to end life.
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal intent, desire to die, or suicidal thoughts (even if unwanted), it does not fit 'Ideation'.
    *   Since there is no plan, method, or intended action *for suicide*, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   Since the actions described, while risky, were not initiated with suicidal intent, they do not constitute an 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and concerning coping behaviors, but lacks clear, current, personal suicidal intent.

    - Is there a vague reference to action implying a method or plan with high imminence? No, there is no mention of any action, only a state of mind.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of mind.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear, personal desire for life to end (""I see no point in living anymore"") combined with significant distress and hopelessness. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it is an explicit personal expression of wanting life to end.
    - It is not 'Indicator' because it's a direct statement of personal desire for life to cease, not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts. Phrases like ""I see no point in living anymore"" are considered strong expressions of ideation.
    - It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations.
    - It is not 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly indicates suicidal ideation without any specific plan or past action.

132,"Update I guess. So my friend now knows this account and I didn't delete all my history so she knows how fucked up I am. I didn't anyone to know, obviously. It's unfair on them, my problems are my own not theirs. They deserve so much more than me and know I feel so guilty. &amp;#x200B;. So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states, ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow."" This explicitly mentions a method (""pills"") and a lethal outcome (""might not wake up tomorrow"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fucked up,"" ""guilty,"" ""unfair on them,"" ""my problems are my own not theirs,"" ""deserve so much more than me."" These indicate severe distress, self-blame, and a sense of being a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is a statement of an action already performed, involving a specific method (pills) with lethal intent. The message itself (""So here you, Macy..."") serves as a final communication or preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** The verb tense ""taken"" (past participle, implying a completed action in the recent past or present perfect) combined with the context strongly suggests an action that has just occurred or is currently ongoing.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""might not wake up tomorrow"" indicates immediate or very near-term consequence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The act of taking a large quantity of pills with the expectation of not waking up clearly indicates a desire for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not using those exact words.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. The statement ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow"" is a clear, indirect expression of a desire to die by one's own hand.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer describes acting on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""pills"" is a specific substance/method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills is an initiated action. The message to Macy (""So here you, Macy..."") serves as a form of preparation (a goodbye/explanation).
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Here, the reference to action is not vague; it's a direct statement of having *taken* the pills.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a very recent or ongoing *initiated action*: ""taken a fuck load of pills."" The consequence (""might not wake up tomorrow"") refers to the future outcome of this initiated action.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes, ""taken a fuck load of pills"" describes an action that has already occurred or is currently occurring. This is a self-initiated, potentially lethal action. This fits the definition of an 'Attempt' as it describes an action that was *initiated*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. There is clear suicidal intent and an initiated action.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect. There is a specific method mentioned and an action already taken, not just thoughts or desires.
    *   **Behavior:** Incorrect. While 'Behavior' involves a plan/method/intended action, the phrasing ""taken a fuck load of pills"" describes an action that *has already been initiated*, not just a future plan or preparation for an action yet to occur. The key distinction for 'Attempt' is an *initiated action*.
    *   **Attempt:** This is the best fit. The definition states: ""The content describes **past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death** (e.g., 'I took all my pills last night...')."" The post directly describes ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow,"" which is a clear, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

I'm tired of the constant struggle and have a fear of failing an attempt once again. I intend to do it right this time and not make those around me suffer with the blatant telling of my suicidal thoughts.

I am and will not be one of those people.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""planning out my suicide"", ""no intention of anyone stopping me and to be saved"", ""fear of failing an attempt once again"", ""intend to do it right this time"", ""blatant telling of my suicidal thoughts"", ""continue living"", ""push through their suicidal thoughts"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of the constant struggle"", ""can't find a reason nor can I create one to continue living"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""planning out my suicide"" indicates a plan is being developed. ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest"" gives a specific timeline. ""intend to do it right this time"" implies careful consideration of method/execution.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""fear of failing an attempt once again"" and ""intend to do it right this time"" explicitly state a past initiated suicidal action by the author.
    *   **Imminence:** ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest"" indicates a near-future deadline.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die (""planning out my suicide"", ""no intention of anyone stopping me"", ""can't find a reason... to continue living"", ""I am and will not be one of those people"" who push through).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a clear desire to die and not be stopped.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they embrace them as their path.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post states ""planning out my suicide"" and sets a specific date (""January 1st""), which indicates a plan is being formed and will be acted upon. The phrase ""intend to do it right this time"" implies a method will be chosen carefully. While no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is named, the explicit statement of ""planning"" and intent to ""do it right"" points strongly towards active planning for a suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past event: ""fear of failing an attempt once again"" and ""intend to do it right this time"" clearly indicate a past *initiated suicidal action* by the author.
    *   It also describes a current/future intention: ""I'm planning out my suicide"", ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st"".
    *   A specific, potentially lethal action was initiated by the author in the past, as explicitly stated (""failing an attempt once again"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It also includes explicit planning (""planning out my suicide"") and a timeline, which would typically point towards 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    *   The phrases ""fear of failing an attempt once again"" and ""intend to do it right this time"" are direct admissions by the author of a past initiated suicidal action. This past action is brought up in the context of their current suicidal planning and intent.
    *   According to the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Attempt' due to the explicit mention of a past initiated suicidal action by the author.

For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""do not want to live anymore"", ""scared to kill myself"", ""hate being alive"", ""should just do it now"", ""wish i was never born"".
    - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, and anhedonia (""100% do not want to live anymore"", ""hate being alive"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The phrase ""should just do it now"" expresses a thought about acting, but no method or plan is provided.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""should just do it now"" suggests a thought of immediate action, but this is immediately countered by ""For now i guess i will just sit here"", indicating no immediate plan to act.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a very clear and strong stated desire to not be alive (""100% do not want to live anymore"", ""hate being alive""). The fear of acting (""scared to kill myself"") is a barrier to action, not a negation of the desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""do not want to live anymore"", which are direct phrases indicating suicidal intent.
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/not be alive (""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore"", ""I actually hate being alive"").
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they express distress about the implications for others (""don't want to weigh down my family and friends"") and fear of the act itself, but the desire to die is personal and explicit.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - While there's a strong desire to die and a thought about acting (""should just do it now""), there is no indication of *how* this would be done, and the imminence of action is negated by ""For now i guess i will just sit here"". Therefore, no plan, method, or intended action is identified.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current feelings and thoughts about potential future actions (""should just do it now""), but no concrete future intention with a method.
    - No past specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts (""100% do not want to live anymore"", ""scared to kill myself"", ""hate being alive""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is explicit and personal, not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. The phrase ""should just do it now"" is a thought, not a concrete plan or intended action with a method. The fear of acting and the statement ""For now i guess i will just sit here"" further confirm the absence of a concrete plan or immediate intended action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the strong, explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but without any plan, method, or preparation, the post best fits the 'Ideation' category.

135,"i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die. Does anyone else do this?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""attempt suicide"" and ""hang myself."" The method is hanging.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Not directly stated, but the act of attempting suicide, even ""half heartedly,"" indicates significant distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post describes a specific action: ""i hang myself."" It also describes a safety mechanism/preparation: ""always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto."" This is a description of an *initiated action* with a specific method and a specific setup.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair..."" This describes repeated, past, and ongoing *initiated actions*.
    *   **Imminence:** ""frequently"" implies ongoing, repeated actions, not a one-time past event or a future plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""half heartedly"" and ""so i don't die"" indicates a complex or ambivalent desire. However, the *action* described is still a self-initiated, potentially lethal act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""attempt suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? The desire is ambivalent (""half heartedly,"" ""so i don't die""), but the *action* described is an attempt at suicide. The definition of 'Attempt' focuses on the *action initiated*, even if the outcome was not death or the intent was mixed.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""hang myself"" and using a ""chair or elevated object.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The setup with the chair is a preparation for the *action*. However, this is not just a future plan; it describes an action that has been *initiated*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a repeated *past and ongoing initiated action* (""frequently,"" ""always"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes, ""i hang myself."" This is a self-initiated action described as potentially lethal, even with the safety mechanism. The phrase ""so i don't die"" indicates that the action is stopped or interrupted, which aligns with the definition of an attempt that ""ultimately failed to cause death.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The phrase ""i hang myself but always leave a chair... so i don't die"" perfectly fits the description of an initiated action that was interrupted or failed.
    *   The ""half heartedly"" aspect and the explicit statement ""so i don't die"" indicate a complex intent, but the *action itself* is a self-initiated, potentially lethal act. The 'Attempt' category covers situations where a concrete, potentially life-threatening action was initiated, regardless of its success or the full extent of the desire to die.
    *   This is not 'Indicator' because there is clear mention of ""attempt suicide"" and specific actions.
    *   This is not 'Ideation' because actual actions are described, not just thoughts or desires.
    *   This is not 'Behavior' because it describes *initiated actions* that have already occurred repeatedly, not just a plan for a future action. While there's a ""plan"" within the action (the chair), the core of the post is the *initiation* of the hanging. 'Attempt' takes precedence when an initiated action is described.

I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to.

    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" ""this world's just not meant for me."" These indicate a current desire to end life, but no specific timeframe or imminence for action is given.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to not go on, to end life, and a feeling that the world is not meant for them. These are not expressed as unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""had an attempt.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/not be alive: ""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" ""this world's just not meant for me.""
    *   The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   For *current* intent, no specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparations are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a past event and current feelings/intentions.
    *   It clearly describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past: ""I had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed."" This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt' as a past self-initiated suicidal action. The historical nature (""when I was 14"") does not disqualify it, as the author is bringing it up in the context of their current feelings and struggles.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear expressions of current suicidal ideation (""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore""). This would typically be 'Ideation'.
    *   However, the post also explicitly describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: ""I had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed.""
    *   According to the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The phrase ""fuckkkkkkkkdjejekieirieiriodidieiridodiodididodidookdkekekdkoeooeo"" (especially the ""fuck"" and the subsequent seemingly random, distressed typing) strongly indicates extreme frustration, distress, or anger. The preceding statement ""I am 29 still live with my parents"" provides context for this distress, suggesting feelings of being stuck, inadequate, or unhappy with their current life situation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No intentions are stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is no stated desire to die or for life to end. The expression is one of general distress/frustration.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The post conveys intense frustration and distress, but not a desire for death or to end life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.
    *   Based on the lack of explicit suicidal intent and the presence of general distress, this points towards 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a desire to die with high imminence implying a vague action? No desire to die is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current personal situation and expresses current distress/frustration.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, frustration, and dissatisfaction with their current life situation (""I am 29 still live with my parents. fuckkkkkkkk..."").
    *   There is no explicit or implied personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, or wanting life to end. It's a raw expression of negative emotion, but not suicidal ideation.
    *   There is no mention of any plan, method, intended action, or preparations for suicide.
    *   There is no description of any past self-initiated suicidal action.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category, as it expresses general distress and hopelessness (implied by the frustration about their situation) without any clear, current, personal expression of suicidal intent.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm not afraid of killing myself anymore,"" ""I'll break killing myself regardless."" These indicate a strong, persistent desire for death and a lack of fear regarding suicide.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" is a specific method. ""start cutting again"" is a method of self-harm, potentially lethal depending on intent.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've done it many times"" directly refers to past self-initiated actions related to ""killing myself.""
    *   **Imminence:** ""One of these days I'll finally do it,"" ""at the moment there is too much potential interference,"" ""I'll break killing myself regardless."" This suggests a strong future intention, delayed but not abandoned.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die/end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I'll finally do it,"" ""I just wish I could die in my sleep instead"").
    *   There is no negation of these thoughts; they are presented as personal desires/intentions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""figured out how to properly hang myself.""
    *   Another method, ""cutting,"" is also mentioned in a context that implies increasing chances of death (""increase my chances of corona if I start cutting again"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes past actions: ""I've done it many times"" in reference to ""killing myself."" This is a clear statement of past, self-initiated suicidal actions/attempts.
    *   It also describes current/future intentions (""One of these days I'll finally do it,"" ""I'll break killing myself regardless"").
    *   The crucial part here is the explicit mention of past initiated actions (""I've done it many times"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong suicidal ideation and mentions a specific plan/method (""figured out how to properly hang myself""), which would typically lead to 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    *   The phrase ""I've done it many times"" explicitly describes past self-initiated suicidal actions by the author. This directly fits the 'Attempt' definition.
    *   According to the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.

Therefore, despite the strong current ideation and behavioral elements, the explicit mention of past attempts makes 'Attempt' the most fitting classification.

For over the course of a year I've been having some thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all. Like I'm feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all."" ""End it all"" is a common euphemism for suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""not feeling too alright,"" ""feeling doomed,"" ""something worse was coming to me if I kept existing.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past *actions* (attempts) are mentioned, only past *thoughts* (""For over the course of a year I've been having some thoughts"").
    *   **Imminence:** The thoughts are described as ongoing (""over the course of a year"") and currently present (""I'm feeling doomed""). No specific immediate timeframe for action is given, but the thoughts are current.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""telling me to end it all"" implies a personal suicidal thought or desire for life to end. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., ""I don't want these thoughts""). The feeling of being ""doomed"" and that ""something worse was coming to me if I kept existing"" reinforces a desire for life to cease.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end it all"" is a clear euphemism for suicide.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""end it all"" and the feeling of being ""doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing"" strongly imply a desire for life to end or not to exist.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. The thoughts are presented as ongoing and part of their current mental state, without any stated resistance to them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes ongoing thoughts (""over the course of a year"") that are currently present (""I'm feeling doomed"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end (""end it all,"" ""feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does *not* mention any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation, which would elevate it to 'Behavior'.
    *   It does *not* describe a past initiated suicidal action, which would classify it as 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts, as the desire to ""end it all"" is presented as an ongoing thought without negation, making it more than an 'Indicator'.

140,"Just another rant. Keep scrolling. Don't waste your time on a lost cause. I'm almost 30. Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time. I am just a  Useless, shameless, pathetic loser. Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful. I am a useless piece of garbage. Oh wait, garbage can be recycled or made into something. My miserable ass is is as useless as the shit that comes out of it.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" and ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in."" These are direct mentions of specific methods and self-harm actions. The phrase ""Why should I still live"" indicates questioning life's worth.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming despair, self-loathing, hopelessness, guilt, shame (""Suffering from depression and anxiety,"" ""hate the line of career,"" ""hate the stupid decisions,"" ""no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals,"" ""my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell,"" ""I hate myself for everything,"" ""I'm a fuck up,"" ""useless, shameless, pathetic loser,"" ""useless piece of garbage"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No *current* specific plan or preparation is mentioned. However, the past actions described (""tried to drown,"" ""tried to hang,"" ""tried to jump"") clearly involved specific methods.
    *   **References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed:** Yes, ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in."" The author explicitly states these were initiated actions, even though they ""chickened out each time."" This fits the definition of an attempt.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The questioning of life (""Why should I still live"") indicates current ideation, but no immediate plan or intention is stated. The most concrete actions are past.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses profound self-hatred and questions the purpose of their life, implying a desire for life to end due to feeling useless.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not directly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? ""Why should I still live"" coupled with the extreme self-loathing and feeling useless strongly implies a desire for life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to not live is expressed as a genuine feeling.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, specific methods (drowning, hanging, jumping from 4th floor) are mentioned, but they are explicitly in the context of *past* actions. There is no mention of a *current* plan or method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes both. There are current feelings of despair and questioning life's worth. Crucially, it describes *past, specific, self-initiated actions* (""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes. The phrases ""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" and ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor"" clearly indicate initiated, potentially lethal actions by the author, even if they ultimately stopped themselves. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong elements of 'Ideation' (desire for life to end, self-loathing, questioning living).
    *   However, the most definitive statements are the explicit descriptions of past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" ""I even tried to jump""). These actions, even if ""chickened out,"" fit the definition of an 'Attempt' as they were initiated and potentially lethal.
    *   The rule states: ""**'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author**, even if current ideation/behavior is also present."" Since the author clearly describes multiple past initiated suicidal actions, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

141,"Living is not for me and that's okay. I saw a post a while ago where someone said 'you know how going to college is not for everyone, I feel like life is the same' I have never related to something so much. Living is so frustrating for me, I have crippling anxiety for years with no treatment. Living is just so frustrating for someone like me, it doesn't help that i'm sensitive af and that my relationship with my mom sucks.

If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old. I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself which is the only positive thing. I might actually get the courage to do it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""Living is not for me"" - expresses a desire to not live.
        *   ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old."" - direct mention of suicide, past desire to die.
        *   ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"" - direct mention of ""kill myself,"" indicating increasing suicidal intent.
        *   ""which is the only positive thing."" - frames suicide as a positive solution.
        *   ""I might actually get the courage to do it."" - expresses a future intention to act on suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""frustrating,"" ""crippling anxiety,"" ""burned out,"" ""sucks"" (relationship), ""doing nothing for the past year."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""gun,"" ""bridge"") is mentioned. No preparations (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills"") are mentioned. The phrase ""get the courage to do it"" refers to the act of suicide itself, not a specific *how*.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old."" This indicates a past *desire* or *thought* to die, but explicitly states it was *not* acted upon because it was ""damn hard."" It is not a description of an initiated past action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""becoming more confident,"" ""might actually get the courage to do it."" This suggests increasing imminence and a potential future action, but not immediate (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire to die and act on suicidal thoughts. This is not about unwanted thoughts; the writer is becoming ""more confident"" and views it as ""positive.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/not be alive (""Living is not for me,"" ""I would have been gone,"" ""confident to kill myself"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they are embracing them and gaining ""confidence.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   While there is explicit desire and increasing imminence (""might actually get the courage to do it""), there is no ""vague reference to action"" that implies a *method*. ""Do it"" refers to the act of suicide, not a specific means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes past desires (""would have been gone when I was 15"") and current/future intentions (""becoming more confident,"" ""might actually get the courage to do it"").
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past. The statement about being 15 is a hypothetical about what *would have happened* if it weren't too hard, not an actual attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** There is a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent (""Living is not for me,"" ""confident to kill myself,"" ""might actually get the courage to do it""). It's not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Not Behavior:** While there is strong suicidal ideation and a stated increasing intent to act, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The phrase ""might actually get the courage to do it"" signifies intent to act, but lacks the *how* that would classify it as Behavior. If a method, even vague, were present (e.g., ""I'm going to jump,"" ""I'm thinking of taking pills""), it would be Behavior.
    *   **Not Attempt:** The post does not describe any past or very recent self-initiated action that was potentially lethal. The reference to being 15 is a hypothetical about a past desire, not a past attempt.

    Therefore, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a strong personal desire to die, with increasing intent to act, but without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" is a direct statement of intent to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Too much,"" ""the pain is too much"" indicate severe distress and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   **Method:** ""Trazodone"" (a specific medication) and ""alcohol."" This is a clear, specific method.
        *   **Preparations:** ""I have enough Trazodone"" (possession of means), ""will get alcohol today"" (action to acquire additional means).
        *   **Imminence:** ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" indicates extremely high imminence.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""it finally happened I got to the point where the pain is too much and the 'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better."" This describes a past internal struggle and a shift in mindset, not a past initiated suicidal action/attempt.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die (""be dead"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" is a very strong and unambiguous statement of intent to die by their own hand.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""be dead in less than 24 hours.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post expresses a clear intent to act on these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""Trazodone"" and ""alcohol"" are explicitly named as the method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have enough Trazodone"" and ""will get alcohol today"" are clear preparations.
    *   The explicit desire to die, high imminence, and specific method/preparations clearly indicate a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of pain and a very near-future intention (""will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The mention of ""if you wanted to die you would"" refers to a past internal thought process and learning to hide feelings, not a past initiated attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** No, there is clear personal intent to die and a plan/method.
    *   **Ideation:** No, because beyond the clear ideation (""be dead""), there are specific methods (""Trazodone,"" ""alcohol"") and preparations (""have enough,"" ""will get"") mentioned, along with high imminence.
    *   **Behavior:** Yes. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent (""be dead in less than 24 hours"") AND mentions a specific method (Trazodone, alcohol) and preparations (""have enough,"" ""will get""). The imminence is very high (""less than 24 hours""). This perfectly fits the definition of Behavior.
    *   **Attempt:** No, the post describes a *future* intended action and current preparations, not a *past initiated action* or attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or specific methods. However, phrases like ""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"", ""I bring nothing to the table. Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning"" strongly imply a desire for life to end or not to exist.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""darkness,"" ""tired of my obsessive negative thoughts,"" ""struggling since I was a child,"" ""so long since I've been happy,"" ""Nothing makes sense anymore,"" ""I want to give up,"" ""guilty for feeling this way,"" ""bringing myself pain,"" ""abuse and shit I've experienced,"" ""My life has no worth.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""struggling since I was a child,"" ""abuse and shit I've experienced is in the past."" These refer to general past struggles and abuse, not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I want to give up"" is a present desire. No specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""soon"" for an action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a clear desire to ""give up,"" questions their existence (""Why the fuck am I alive and existing?""), and states ""My life has no worth. No meaning."" This indicates a genuine wish for life to end or not to exist.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes. Phrases like ""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing,"" and ""My life has no worth. No meaning"" clearly convey a desire for life to end or not to exist.
    *   **Explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No. The guilt mentioned is about *feeling* the negative thoughts, not about not wanting to act on suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned?** No.
    *   **Signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Vague reference to action implying method/plan with high imminence?** No. There is no mention of an intended action, even vague, nor high imminence for an action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Past event, current/future intention, or both?** Primarily current feelings and a desire to ""give up."" No past or future *actions* are described.
    *   **Specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past?** No. The post mentions past struggles and abuse, but not past suicidal actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound despair, feelings of worthlessness (""My life has no worth. No meaning""), and a clear desire to ""give up"" and questions their existence (""Why the fuck am I alive""). These are strong personal expressions of wanting life to end or not to exist. This goes beyond general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts, making it more than 'Indicator'.
    *   However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out a suicidal act. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The content aligns perfectly with the 'Ideation' definition: ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end... but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""let myself pass away,"" ""kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself this way,"" ""going to die,"" ""when I die."" The method is explicitly stated as ""anorexia"" and reducing weight to ""78 pounds"" or lower ""for it to finally kill me.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** While not explicitly stated, the intent to die via a slow, painful method implies severe distress and a desire for life to end. The mention of ""cushion the pain"" for others suggests a complex emotional state, possibly including feelings of burden or a desire to control the impact of their death.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** Yes, the plan is to die by starvation/anorexia, with a specific target weight (""78 pounds,"" and potentially lower) as the means to ""finally kill me."" This is a clear, ongoing plan with a specific method.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""my new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me."" This indicates a current, active process with a clear lethal intent for the future. It's not immediate ""tonight"" but it's a definite, active plan being pursued.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a very clear and explicit desire to die: ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""for it to finally kill me,"" ""I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself this way.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""for it to finally kill me,"" ""I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire and intent to act are clearly stated.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, the method is starvation/anorexia, with a specific weight goal (""78 pounds"" or lower) explicitly stated as the means to ""finally kill me."" This is a specific, ongoing method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The setting of a ""new goal weight"" for the purpose of dying is a form of preparation and planning.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Here, the method is explicit and directly linked to the lethal outcome.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current and future intention: ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""my new goal weight is 78 pounds,"" ""might have to go lower for it to finally kill me."" This indicates an ongoing process with a lethal goal.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, it describes a *current* behavior (anorexia, weight loss) with a *future lethal intent*. It is not a past *attempt* that failed, but an ongoing *behavior* with a lethal goal.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Not applicable, as there is clear, personal suicidal intent and a method.
    *   **Ideation:** Not applicable, as there is not only explicit ideation but also a clear plan/method being actively pursued.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits perfectly. The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""kill me"") AND mentions a specific plan/method (""anorexia,"" ""new goal weight is 78 pounds,"" ""go lower for it to finally kill me"") that is being used to carry out the suicidal intent. This is an intended action with a clear method.
    *   **Attempt:** Not applicable, as the post describes an ongoing/future intended action, not a past initiated action that was potentially lethal and failed or was interrupted.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly describes a desire to die along with a specific method and plan being pursued.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" and mentions a specific method: ""charcoal bbq in a tent."" This is a known method for carbon monoxide poisoning.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** No direct emotional indicators are present. The post is a direct question.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** A specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent"") is identified and inquired about in the context of suicide. While not a direct statement of intent to use it, asking about its possibility as a means of suicide indicates an exploration of a specific method.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No explicit imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). The question is hypothetical but practical.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The post doesn't say ""I want to die,"" but asking about the possibility of using a specific, lethal method for suicide strongly implies that the writer is personally considering or exploring this option. It's not an abstract academic question.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While not a direct statement of desire, the inquiry about the possibility of *suicide* using a *specific method* strongly implies personal consideration of suicide. This is not a general or abstract question.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the question explores the *possibility* of acting, rather than negating it.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While imminence is not high, the *specificity of the method* is very high. The question ""Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?"" is a direct inquiry into the feasibility of a specific suicidal act using a specific method. This moves beyond mere ideation into exploring the practicalities of a specific method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current inquiry about a potential future action.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and a specific method, indicating more than general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is implied suicidal intent, the post *also* mentions a specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent""). Ideation is for thoughts/desire *without* a specific plan/method.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits. The post includes an implicit expression of suicidal intent (by asking about the possibility of suicide) *and* mentions a specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent""). Inquiring about the possibility of using a specific, known lethal method for suicide constitutes exploring a plan or method.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. There is no description of a past initiated action.

    The presence of a specific method being inquired about, in the context of ""suicide,"" is the key factor pushing this into 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'. It's not just a thought; it's an exploration of *how* to carry it out.

146,"Life so full of contradictions that it's not worth it. I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states, ""everything that makes me want want to die."" However, it immediately follows with a crucial negation: ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" It also mentions ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me,"" which is a common theme in suicidal ideation (feeling like a burden).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, self-loathing (""everything about me is wrong,"" ""hate everything about how I look,"" ""self loathing,"" ""don't think I'll ever be good enough,"" ""feel like an embarrassment,"" ""don't deserve anything"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** Not applicable, as intent is explicitly negated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses profound distress and thoughts that lead to wanting to die, but explicitly denies the *desire to act* on those thoughts (""I don't feel like actually committing die""). This is a key distinction.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""committing die"" (a clear reference to committing suicide).
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? It expresses the *feeling* of wanting to die due to distress, but then explicitly states, ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" This negates a current personal desire to die by suicide.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" directly states they do not want to act on the thoughts of dying.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or signs of preparation are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and thoughts. There are no descriptions of past initiated actions or future intended actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains significant distress, self-loathing, and the statement ""makes me want want to die."" These elements, if taken alone, might suggest 'Ideation'.
    *   However, the critical phrase ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" explicitly negates the personal desire to act on suicidal thoughts. This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The author is expressing extreme distress and thoughts of dying, but clarifies that they do not have the intent to act on them.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because Ideation requires a *clear, current, personal expression of desire to die* without such a strong negation of intent to act.
    *   It does not meet 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' as there is no mention of a plan, method, preparation, or any past initiated action.
    *   Given the explicit negation of intent to ""actually committing die,"" despite the profound distress and thoughts of wanting to die, the post falls into the 'Indicator' category.

147,My heart hurts and I want to die. My long term bf and I got into a bad fight. All because I thought I asked a harmless question and it spiraled. Usually when we fight we always end positively but this time it felt different. It ended badly. It was more let's just forget this happened. We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time. I loved him so much and felt so lucky to be with him. I don't really know what to do. I'm just passively letting whatever happen happen. I don't care. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down. It hurts so much and I just feel like dying. I just wish I had someone to talk to,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My heart hurts,"" ""bad fight,"" ""felt different,"" ""ended badly,"" ""relationship feels damaged,"" ""don't know what to do,"" ""don't care,"" ""worst person,"" ""hurts so much."" These indicate intense emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair related to a relationship issue.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparations (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire to die is stated in the present tense (""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live""), but there's no indication of immediate action or a specific timeframe for acting on these feelings. The phrase ""I'm just passively letting whatever happen happen. I don't care"" suggests a state of apathy rather than active planning.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly expresses a personal desire to die or not to live; these are not presented as unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post does not explicitly use ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   However, it *does* express a clear desire to die/not be alive: ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" ""I just feel like dying."" This is a strong, personal expression of suicidal ideation.
    *   The writer does *not* state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge), tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    *   No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are present.
    *   There is no vague reference to action that implies a method or plan, even with high imminence. The ""passively letting whatever happen happen"" indicates a lack of active intent for a specific action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and desires (""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, personal expressions of a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" ""I just feel like dying""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a direct statement of suicidal desire.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end, without any concrete plan, method, or action.

148,"3 weeks TW(animal abuse-sexual assault-murder). I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. it doesn't help having this bullshit thing women have every month. But I can't do it anymore. Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down. Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human? Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""I can't do it anymore."" - Expresses extreme distress and inability to cope.
        *   ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around."" - Implies a deadline for current suffering, after which an unstated action will occur.
        *   ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down."" - This is a strong metaphor for suicide/death, referring to the author themselves (""It sounds weird hearing the 'dog' put itself down""). This indicates a desire for life to end.
        *   ""Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better?"" and ""Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me?"" - These are expressions of self-harm ideation or a desire for suffering, but not directly suicidal.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I can't do it anymore,"" ""Nothing's real to me anymore,"" ""I can't find a way to release,"" ""I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything.""), despair, self-loathing (""I'm an abomination,"" ""What is wrong with me,"" ""I treat myself like a sick dog""), confusion, anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned. No preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The ""put down"" metaphor describes the *desired outcome* (death), not a *method* or *plan*.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""3 weeks"" provides a clear timeframe for the current situation to improve, implying that if it doesn't, the ""put down"" (suicide) will occur. This indicates a time-limited intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly expresses a desire for their suffering to end, culminating in the metaphorical ""put down,"" which signifies a desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. The phrase ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down"" (referring to self) is a clear, albeit metaphorical, expression of wanting to die or end one's life. ""I can't do it anymore"" combined with the deadline and the ""put down"" metaphor strongly indicates a desire for life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to be ""put down"" is presented as an eventual outcome, not an unwanted thought.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The ""put down"" is the desired *outcome*, not a specific *method*.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While there's high imminence (""3 weeks""), there's no reference to *how* the ""put down"" would occur, or any action to facilitate it. It remains a desired end state, not a planned action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current distress and a future time-limited intention (""3 weeks to turn around,"" ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die, using the ""put down"" metaphor, and sets a timeframe for this. This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, making it more than 'Indicator'.
    *   However, despite the clear suicidal intent and the timeframe, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out the suicidal act. The ""put down"" is the desired end, not a description of the means to achieve it. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Given the explicit personal expression of a desire for life to end, but without a plan/method/action, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life.

    *   **Imminence:** ""Today, I feel better."" ""I am out of my hole for now."" ""I don't think I would do 'it'."" The *current* imminence is low, but the *history* of serious plotting and preparation is significant.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer describes past serious ""plotting"" and ""drafting a will"" related to suicide, indicating a past personal desire. However, they explicitly state, ""I don't think I would do 'it',"" and ""I am out of my hole for now,"" indicating a *current* lack of desire to act. The post is about the *feeling* of obligation to past suicidal thoughts/plans.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide.""
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** The post describes a *past/on-off* serious desire (""plotting my suicide seriously"") and preparation (""drafted my will""). While the *current* desire to act is negated (""I don't think I would do 'it'""), the post is about the *lingering effect* of this past serious intent and preparation. The past intent was clearly present and serious enough to lead to plotting and preparing.
    *   **Explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Yes, ""I don't think I would do 'it',"" ""I am out of my hole for now."" This indicates a *current* lack of intent to act, but the preceding content describes *past serious plotting and preparation* that falls under 'Behavior'.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** ""plotting my suicide seriously"" implies a plan. ""wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so"" implies a specific type of method/location that would require professional discovery. ""would never use a weapon from my household"" rules out a method, but shows consideration of others.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" This is a direct and concrete preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes a past/ongoing pattern of ""plotting"" and a specific past preparation (""Yesterday, I drafted my will""). The *current* intention is explicitly stated as *not* to act (""I don't think I would do 'it'"").
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No, no initiated action is described. ""Plotting"" and ""drafting a will"" are planning and preparation, not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post contains clear, personal, serious mentions of plotting and preparation, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there's ideation (""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting""), the post also explicitly mentions ""drafted my will"" (preparation) and ""plotting"" (plan), which moves it beyond mere ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** This is the best fit. The post describes ""plotting my suicide seriously"" (a plan) and ""drafted my will"" (a preparation). The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide... or preparations being taken."" Even though the author states they are currently ""out of my hole"" and ""don't think I would do 'it',"" the content *describes* past serious planning and preparation that fits the 'Behavior' criteria. The current low imminence does not negate the described past actions of planning and preparing.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No initiated action is described.

The presence of ""plotting my suicide seriously"" (plan) and ""drafted my will"" (preparation) clearly places this post in the 'Behavior' category, despite the author's current feeling of not wanting to act.

These indicate severe emotional distress, feelings of being a burden, anxiety, frustration, and profound isolation/hopelessness regarding their social situation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No stated suicidal intentions. The phrase ""i want it to stop"" refers to the negative experiences they are enduring, not a desire to end their life.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a desire for the negative interactions and abuse to stop. They express feeling like a burden (""he would be better off without me"") and extreme isolation (""if i leave them i have no one""). While these are significant risk factors for suicide, they are not direct statements of personal suicidal desire or intent.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is an expression of feeling like a burden, which is a strong *indicator* of suicidal ideation, but it is not a direct statement of the author's personal desire to die or for life to end. The desire ""i want it to stop"" refers to the negative treatment, not life itself.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied in relation to a suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current and ongoing emotional distress and interpersonal problems. There is no description of any past or current initiated suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys significant distress, feelings of being a burden, anxiety, and profound hopelessness/isolation related to their social and home life. These are strong indicators of mental health struggles and potential suicide risk factors.
    *   However, the post *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author*. Phrases like ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" indicate feeling like a burden, which is a significant risk factor, but it's not a direct statement of the author's desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't here,"" ""I hate living""). The desire ""i want it to stop"" refers to the abuse/criticism, not life itself.
    *   Since there is no explicit personal desire to die, no plan/method, and no past attempt, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category. It expresses general distress and feelings (like being a burden) that are associated with suicide risk, but without the direct, personal suicidal intent required for 'Ideation'.

The phrase ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally"" is directed at someone else and implies a wish for their absence/death, not the author's own.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme anger (""FUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCFFFKKKKKKKK YOUUUUU"", ""FUCK YOU""), profound exhaustion and despair (""I'm so tired,"" ""no more energy to deal with this anymore,"" ""world is just fucked in every single way,"" ""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED""), feeling abandoned. These are strong indicators of distress and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** No mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No stated intentions regarding self-harm or suicide.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses overwhelming fatigue and despair, and a sense that ""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED."" They question the act of being brought into this world given its state and abandonment. However, there is no explicit statement of wanting to die, wanting their own life to end, or wishing they weren't alive *personally*. The anger and despair are directed outwards at ""you"" and ""her"" and the general state of the world. The ""peace"" sought is from someone else's absence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No explicit personal desire to die or for their own life to end. The expressions of ""so tired"" and ""no more energy"" convey extreme emotional exhaustion and despair, but not a direct wish for death. The questioning of being brought into a ""fucked"" world is existential despair, not a personal desire to end their own life.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned.
    *   No signs of preparation.
    *   No vague reference to action implying a method or plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current overwhelming emotional states (anger, exhaustion, despair).
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is filled with intense negative emotions: anger, frustration, exhaustion, and a sense of hopelessness about the world and a specific personal situation. These are clear indicators of significant distress.
    *   However, there is no explicit personal statement of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, or a wish for their own life to end. The despair is existential and directed outwards or at the general state of things, rather than a direct personal suicidal intent.
    *   The absence of any explicit suicidal intent, desire to die, plan, method, or past attempt rules out Ideation, Behavior, and Attempt.
    *   The strong expression of general distress, sadness, and hopelessness, without a clear personal expression of suicidal intent, fits the definition of 'Indicator'.

152,"I don't want to kill myself, but. I have literally nothing going for me. I graduated college almost 2 years ago, and I still don't have a job. I pushed all my friends away. I barely leave the house anymore. All I want is to have a job so I can be a normal, functioning member of society. I just want to have a sense of purpose. I want to meet new people and go places. I'm so sick of sitting inside all day, waiting for the next day in hopes it will somehow be the day where everything changes. I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life. And at this rate, I really feel like nothing is going to change. It's been so stagnant for so long. Everyone I know has a great job, a great relationship, their own apartment; they're all moving forward in life, meanwhile I'm still sitting in the same house that I grew up in. I'm so sick of this. I've always been a melancholic guy, but I really want to give life a chance. I want to have financial independence, a girlfriend, hobbies, and see where it takes me. But it seems like the world rejects me at every turn. I've always prided myself on being a pretty tough and resilient person, but I've reached a point where I really don't know what's next for me. I feel like the walls are closing in and there's no escape.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""I don't want to kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide, but in a negating context. No other mentions of death, dying, self-harm, or specific methods/means.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""literally nothing going for me,"" ""pushed all my friends away,"" ""barely leave the house anymore,"" ""sick of sitting inside all day,"" ""nothing is going to change,"" ""so stagnant for so long,"" ""sick of this,"" ""world rejects me at every turn,"" ""don't know what's next for me,"" ""walls are closing in and there's no escape."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, stagnation, isolation, and feeling trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal or self-harm actions mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No intentions to act are stated. The stated desire is to *not* kill themselves and to improve their life.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states ""I don't want to kill myself."" They also state ""I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life"" and ""I really want to give life a chance."" They express a strong desire for positive change (""want to have a job,"" ""sense of purpose,"" ""meet new people,"" ""financial independence,"" ""a girlfriend, hobbies""). The distress is about their current circumstances and feeling stuck, not a desire to end their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I don't want to kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The phrase ""I don't want to kill myself"" directly negates this. Further, ""I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life"" and ""I really want to give life a chance"" confirm a desire to live, albeit a different life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I don't want to kill myself"" clearly states they do not want to act on such thoughts, if they even have them (the post doesn't explicitly state having suicidal thoughts, but rather negates the desire to act). The primary sentiment is distress about their life circumstances, not a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned.
    *   No signs of preparation.
    *   There is no explicit desire to die, so the question of vague action coupled with high imminence is not applicable.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state of prolonged distress and stagnation.
    *   No past, current, or future specific, potentially lethal actions initiated by the author are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The most crucial element is the explicit statement: ""I don't want to kill myself."" This directly negates suicidal intent.
    *   While the post contains significant indicators of distress, hopelessness, and feeling trapped (""nothing going for me,"" ""sick of this,"" ""walls are closing in and there's no escape""), these are expressions of despair about their current life situation, not a desire to end their life.
    *   The author explicitly articulates a desire to live a different life and ""give life a chance.""
    *   This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness... but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die..."" The ""I don't want to kill myself"" fits this criteria. There is no personal desire to die expressed.

Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself."" The phrase ""try and go out"" in this context strongly implies an intention to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""overwhelming and difficult,"" ""in a rut,"" ""very small support system,"" ""too weak and pathetic."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of inadequacy.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family"" specifies a time and context. ""I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" indicates a preparatory action (saying goodbye/reaching out) and an intended action (""go out"" as a euphemism for ending life).
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""tomorrow,"" ""probably will"" indicates a near-future intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself."" This is a clear, explicit desire to end life. The internal conflict (""I know I shouldn't,"" ""too weak and pathetic to do it"") does not negate the underlying desire and stated plan.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die,"" and ""I want to kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    *   No, the writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. While there's internal conflict, the desire and intention are clearly present.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method isn't explicitly named (e.g., ""pills,"" ""gun""), but an intended action (""try and go out"") is strongly implied in the context of wanting to die tomorrow and saying goodbyes.
    *   There are clear signs of preparation: ""hit up everyone I have in my contacts"" (a common sign of preparing to say goodbye).
    *   Given the explicit desire to die and high imminence (""tomorrow""), the vague ""try and go out"" coupled with the preparatory action (contacting everyone) implies an intended action to end life.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current desire and a future intention/plan (""tomorrow"").
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, it goes beyond mere ideation by including a specific timeframe (""tomorrow""), preparatory actions (""hit up everyone I have in my contacts""), and an implied intended action (""try and go out""). While the method is vague, the combination of strong intent, high imminence, and preparatory steps is sufficient to classify it as 'Behavior'. The statement ""I just am too weak and pathetic to do it"" expresses a perceived barrier to action, but it does not negate the *plan* or *desire* that is otherwise clearly articulated.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit desire to die, the specific timeframe, and the mention of preparatory actions and an intended action, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

154,my good days make me realize how useless life is. after having a huge depressive episode I've been having what I'd consider 'good' days for the past couple days. nothing bad has happened to me. everything has been good. and I'm still dead inside. still sad. still anhedonic. I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""useless life"", ""dead inside"", ""yeet myself way too much"". ""Yeet myself"" is a slang term commonly used to mean ""kill myself"" or ""harm myself severely"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""useless life"", ""depressive episode"", ""dead inside"", ""still sad"", ""still anhedonic"", ""beyond saving"", ""want to cry"". These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. ""Yeet myself"" is a vague expression of an intended action, but not a specific method or plan (e.g., ""jump from X,"" ""take Y pills"").
    *   **References to past actions:** No past initiated actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""way too much"" suggests a strong, current urge, but not an immediate timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""now"".
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer states ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"". This clearly expresses a personal desire to end their life or cause severe self-harm, indicating a desire to die or not be alive. The preceding sentences about life being ""useless"" and feeling ""dead inside"" reinforce this desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? ""Yeet myself"" is a strong slang equivalent for ""kill myself"" or ""end myself"" in this context of despair. So, yes, implicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, phrases like ""useless life,"" ""dead inside,"" and ""I just want to... yeet myself"" clearly indicate a desire for life to end or for the author to not be alive.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as something they ""want"" (""I just want to..."").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""Yeet myself"" is an expression of an urge to act, but it lacks specificity regarding *how* (e.g., jumping, overdose, etc.) or *where*.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The desire is strong, and the urge is present (""way too much""), but ""yeet myself"" remains too vague to constitute a *specific* method or plan for 'Behavior'. It's an expression of the *urge* to act, rather than the *details* of the action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current strong desire/intention (""I just want to... yeet myself"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die or for life to end (""useless life,"" ""dead inside,"" ""I just want to... yeet myself""). This rules out 'Indicator', as it's not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   The post expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a strong desire/urge to act (""I just want to... yeet myself""). However, it *lacks a specific plan, method, or preparation* for carrying out this action. While ""yeet myself"" implies an action, it is too vague to be considered a specific method or plan as defined for 'Behavior'. The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action..."". While ""yeet myself"" is an intended action, the *method* is undefined. If there is ""genuine uncertainty about any plan, method, or intended action,"" the classification should lean towards 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no mention of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'Ideation' category best, as it expresses a clear personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts/urges, but without a specific plan or method.

God im such a fucking loser. i could really use someone to talk too. All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all. I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** The phrase ""I tried to end it once before"" is a direct reference to a past suicidal action. ""end it"" is a common euphemism for suicide. ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" indicates a desire for that past action to have been fatal.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i fucked up this time,"" ""God im such a fucking loser,"" ""could really use someone to talk too."" These show significant distress, self-loathing, and a sense of hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No current plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I tried to end it once before."" This is a clear statement of a past self-initiated action.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** No immediate future intention to act is stated. The focus is on past actions and current feelings about those actions.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" implies a current desire for death or a regret that the past attempt failed.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post doesn't use ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" directly, but ""end it"" is a strong euphemism, and ""wish i succeeded"" clearly refers to a past suicidal act and a desire for its outcome. So, yes, there's clear intent related to a past action and a current desire for its success.
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they wish the past action had been successful.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a *current* or *future* suicidal act. The mention of ""tried to end it"" refers to a past *initiated action*, not a current plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past event: ""I tried to end it once before.""
    *   This is a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'. The phrase ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" links this past attempt to their current emotional state.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The most defining element of this post is the clear statement of a past, self-initiated suicidal action: ""I tried to end it once before.""
    *   The 'Attempt' definition explicitly covers this: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical... if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    *   While there are elements of distress and ideation (""God im such a fucking loser,"" ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded""), the explicit mention of a past *initiated action* takes precedence for classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""I just wanna kill myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""bad panic attack,"" ""fear.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: The desire is current (""I just wanna"").
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire to ""kill myself"" stemming from fear/panic. It is not presented as an unwanted thought but as a personal desire.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just wanna kill myself.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated directly and personally (""I just wanna kill myself"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Is there a vague reference to action implying a method or plan with high imminence? No, only the desire is stated, not any action or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current intention/desire.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal, and explicit expression of suicidal desire (""I just wanna kill myself""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' is for general distress or *unwanted* suicidal thoughts without a personal desire to die.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die, without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""give up and just get it over with,"" ""why keep going?"" These phrases strongly imply ending one's life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""defeated,"" ""torture cycle,"" ""screaming at me."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""Every time I am back here"" refers to a recurring mental state/feeling, not a past initiated suicidal action. ""Thought I was doing better"" refers to a past emotional state.
    - Imminence: ""Now my brain is screaming at me"" indicates current, intense feelings. ""Why keep going?"" is a present-tense questioning of life.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrases ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" in the context of ""torture cycle"" and feeling ""defeated"" express a clear desire for life to end or to not continue living. There is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not want to act on them; rather, the subsequent sentences (""I'll never be out of this torture cycle, so why keep going?"") reinforce the personal adoption of this sentiment.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" clearly convey a desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. While ""my brain is screaming at me"" suggests an internal struggle, the subsequent lines ""I'll never be out of this torture cycle, so why keep going?"" show the writer adopting and questioning the value of continuing life, rather than explicitly rejecting the suicidal thoughts. This indicates a personal desire for life to end.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Is there a vague reference to action implying a method/plan with high imminence? No, the phrases are general expressions of wanting to end suffering/life, not an action or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current/future intention (""Now my brain is screaming..."", ""why keep going?"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. ""Every time I am back here"" refers to a recurring mental state, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire for life to end (""get it over with,"" ""why keep going?"") and profound hopelessness (""never be out of this torture cycle,"" ""defeated""). This goes beyond general distress or merely reporting unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    - There is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to end life, but no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

The post clearly conveys a personal desire for life to end without any specific plan or action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""annoyed,"" ""feel stupid,"" ""crying about it,"" ""gets offended over everything."" These indicate significant emotional distress, low self-esteem, and feelings of being misunderstood/attacked.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""currently have suicidal thoughts"" indicates a present state of ideation.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer states they ""currently have suicidal thoughts"" as a direct consequence of their distress. There is no negation of these thoughts (e.g., ""I don't want these thoughts"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** The phrase ""currently have suicidal thoughts"" is a direct personal expression of suicidal ideation. It implies a desire for life to end or for self-harm, as these are the core components of suicidal thoughts.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the writer does not negate the thoughts; they present them as a current reality driven by their distress.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   There is no mention of an intended action beyond the thoughts themselves.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state (""currently have suicidal thoughts"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly states ""I currently have suicidal thoughts."" This is a direct, personal expression of suicidal ideation.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because the suicidal thoughts are explicitly stated and not negated as unwanted.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan, method, intended action, or preparation. Only the thoughts are present.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent initiated suicidal action is described.
    *   Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'Ideation' as it involves explicit personal suicidal thoughts without a plan or action.

159,Anyone here genuinely upset that they are planning to commit suicide?. My life won't ever be the same again and I can't change my circumstances that much so far. I'll never be happy if I continue to live but I'm angry also because if it weren't for my situation I would be happy to continue living. So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""planning to commit suicide,"" ""end it,"" and ""have to go"" (in the context of ending life). No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""genuinely upset,"" ""sad,"" ""angry,"" ""miserable,"" ""no choice.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The phrase ""planning to commit suicide"" indicates a general intention to plan or a mental stage of planning, but not a concrete, actionable plan with details.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The phrase ""planning to commit suicide"" indicates a current intention, but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon,"" ""now"") is provided that would suggest high imminence for immediate action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a clear desire for life to end (""I'll never be happy if I continue to live,"" ""have to go,"" ""no choice but to end it""). While they express sadness and anger about the circumstances leading to this choice, they are not stating that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they don't want to act on them; rather, they feel compelled to act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""planning to commit suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'll never be happy if I continue to live,"" ""have to go,"" ""no choice but to end it.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses distress about the situation *leading* to the decision to end their life, but the intent to act is clear.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, does even a vague reference to action imply a method or plan? The phrase ""planning to commit suicide"" indicates a mental state of planning, but without any ""how"" or ""when"" (beyond the general intent), it does not imply a concrete method or plan. Imminence is not high enough to infer a vague method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""planning to commit suicide,"" ""have to go"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal intent (""planning to commit suicide,"" ""have to go,"" ""no choice but to end it""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or initiated action. The phrase ""planning to commit suicide"" indicates a stage of ideation where the individual is considering or mentally preparing for suicide, but it does not provide the concrete details of *how* or *when* that would qualify it as 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.

I had to tell my parents almost everything about what I've been struggling with and it was mortifying and embarrassing and I want to rip my hair out. I do not like living with them but it was either that or going through with attempting suicide. I feel nauseous just knowing what they know now. I was so close to attempting suicide  but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am, dropping out of college and planning the move back home. I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""attempting suicide"" twice.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Regret, mortifying, embarrassing, ""want to rip my hair out,"" ""feel nauseous,"" ""dreading this,"" not ""mentally stable enough.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method, tool, or preparation is mentioned for a current or past action. However, the phrase ""going through with attempting suicide"" implies an intended action.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I was so close to attempting suicide but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am..."" This describes a very recent situation where the author was on the verge of an action but averted it.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The phrase ""was so close to attempting suicide"" indicates extremely high imminence for the averted action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The choice presented (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"") clearly indicates a strong desire to die or end suffering, leading to being on the brink of an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""attempting suicide"" is explicitly mentioned, indicating clear suicidal intent.
    *   Yes, the context (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"") expresses a clear desire for life to end or to not be alive, leading to the consideration of suicide.
    *   No, the thoughts are not stated as unwanted; rather, the author was on the verge of acting on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned.
    *   No specific preparation (e.g., writing a note) is mentioned.
    *   However, the phrases ""going through with attempting suicide"" and ""was so close to attempting suicide"" imply an *intended action* with extremely high imminence. While the *method* is vague, the *action* itself (""attempting suicide"") is clearly intended and was nearly executed. This fits the 'intended action' aspect of Behavior.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a very recent past situation where the author was on the verge of a suicidal act (""was so close to attempting suicide""). The current situation (moving back home) is a direct consequence of averting that act.
    *   The crucial distinction for 'Attempt' is a *self-initiated action*. The post states ""I was so close to attempting suicide *but* in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom."" This indicates that the action itself was *not initiated* but was averted at the last moment by reaching out. It was a near-attempt, not an initiated attempt that was interrupted. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** Clear personal suicidal intent and desire to end suffering are present.
    *   **Not Ideation:** The description goes beyond mere thoughts or desires. The phrases ""going through with attempting suicide"" and ""was so close to attempting suicide"" indicate an *intended action* with extremely high imminence, which is a key component of 'Behavior'.
    *   **Not Attempt:** No *initiated* action is described. The author explicitly states they were ""so close to attempting suicide"" but *instead* reached out, meaning the attempt was averted, not initiated and then interrupted.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post expresses clear suicidal intent and describes being on the verge of carrying out an *intended action* (""attempting suicide"") with very high imminence, even if a specific method is not detailed. The intent to act was present and nearly realized.

161,I cant take it. I wont kill myself of course but the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity. Its excruciating,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course"". It mentions ""pain"" and wanting to ""scream and break everything"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""I cant take it,"" ""pain,"" ""scream,"" ""break everything,"" ""excruciating."" These indicate significant distress and emotional overwhelm.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not applicable as suicidal intent is negated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course,"" which is a clear negation of suicidal desire or intent. They are expressing distress and pain, but not a desire to die by suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No, it explicitly negates this desire with ""I wont kill myself of course.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, the phrase ""I wont kill myself of course"" directly states they do not want to act on such thoughts, or that they are not even considering it despite the pain. This strongly leans towards 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Not applicable, as there is no explicit desire to die.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current distress.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses intense emotional pain and distress (""I cant take it,"" ""pain,"" ""excruciating"").
    - However, it contains an explicit negation of suicidal intent: ""I wont kill myself of course.""
    - According to the definitions, 'Indicator' applies when there is general distress or when suicidal thoughts are mentioned but explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die. This post fits that description perfectly. The author is in pain but is actively stating they will not act suicidally.
    - 'Ideation' requires a clear personal expression of suicidal desire or thoughts, which is explicitly negated here.
    - 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are not applicable as there is no plan/method/action or past initiated attempt described.

162,I wish I could stop obsessing over appearance. All the females around me want to become prettier which has only intensified my gender dysphoria. I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing. I want to be a male now.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""obsessing over appearance,"" ""intensified my gender dysphoria,"" ""hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing."" These indicate distress and discomfort related to gender identity, but not specifically suicidal ideation or intent.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: Not applicable as no suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire to stop obsessing over appearance and a strong desire to be male. There is no stated desire to die or for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The distress is clearly about gender identity and appearance, not about ending life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current feelings and desires related to gender dysphoria.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses significant emotional distress (""gender dysphoria,"" ""hate wearing,"" ""wish I could stop obsessing"").
    - However, it completely lacks any direct or indirect mention of suicide, death, self-harm, or a desire to end life. The distress is focused on gender identity and appearance.
    - It does not meet the criteria for Ideation because there are no explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive.
    - It does not meet the criteria for Behavior as there is no plan, method, or intended action.
    - It does not meet the criteria for Attempt as there is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - Since the post expresses general distress and unhappiness but lacks any clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent, it falls under 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" (euphemism for suicide).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""absolutely hate myself,"" ""loathe my existence,"" ""Today was another day. A bad one."" (hopelessness, self-loathing).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The desire to ""end it all"" is immediately countered by ""I just want the courage to endure it all."" The post then shifts to a supportive, hopeful tone for others, indicating a lack of immediate intent to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The post starts with a desire to ""end it all"" but immediately pivots to a desire to ""endure it all."" The remainder of the post is focused on offering support and encouragement to others to ""Stay around to see these days,"" implying the author is also trying to stay. This strong counter-statement and supportive tone suggest the suicidal thoughts are present but not the author's current, active desire to die; rather, they are struggling with them and choosing to endure.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end it all"" is a clear euphemism.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Initially, yes (""wish I had the courage to end it all,"" ""loathe my existence""). However, this is immediately followed by ""And yet. I just want the courage to endure it all."" and a lengthy passage encouraging others (and implicitly, themselves) to stay alive and find hope.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The phrase ""I just want the courage to endure it all"" directly counters the ""courage to end it all,"" indicating a desire *not* to act on the suicidal thoughts, but to find strength to live through them. The subsequent supportive message reinforces this. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned or implied.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a past desire to ""end it all"" that is now being resisted by a desire to ""endure."" No past or current initiated actions are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains expressions of suicidal thoughts (""wish I had the courage to end it all"") and deep despair (""loathe my existence""). If the post ended there, it would be 'Ideation'.
    *   However, the author immediately counters the suicidal desire with ""I just want the courage to endure it all."" The rest of the post is dedicated to offering support and encouragement to others to ""Stay around to see these days,"" which strongly implies the author is also choosing to endure and is actively resisting the suicidal impulse.
    *   This explicit negation of the desire to act on suicidal thoughts and the focus on endurance and support for life aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The author is struggling with the thoughts but is actively choosing to endure and help others.
    *   There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, despite the initial strong language, the overall context indicates that the author is struggling with suicidal thoughts but is actively choosing to resist them and endure, making it an 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now,"" ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""anxiety has gotten much more severe,"" ""interfering with almost everything i do,"" ""sick of my family,"" ""no friends at school,"" ""shitty parents and siblings."" (Hopelessness, isolation, despair, burden).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""didn't have anything to do it with"" (implies a search for or desire for means, and that the only barrier was lack of means). ""yet i still consider"" (ongoing ideation).
    *   **References to past actions:** ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide"" - This describes a very recent, past event where the author was on the verge of initiating a suicidal act, and the only thing preventing it was the lack of means. This is a thwarted action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""a few days ago"" (very recent past), ""yet i still consider"" (current, ongoing ideation).
    *   **Stated desire:** ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now"" and ""almost committed suicide"" clearly indicate a desire to not be alive or to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""almost committed suicide"" explicitly mentions suicide.
    *   Yes, ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now"" expresses a clear desire to not be alive.
    *   The writer does *not* state they do not want these thoughts; ""yet i still consider"" indicates ongoing personal suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The phrase ""didn't have anything to do it with"" is crucial. It indicates that the *only* thing preventing the suicidal act ""a few days ago"" was the lack of a specific method/means. This implies a very high level of intent and readiness to act, where the action was only thwarted by an external factor. While no specific method is named, the intent to act was present, and the lack of means was the barrier. This goes beyond mere planning; it's a thwarted action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide"" describes a specific, recent, self-initiated action that was on the verge of being carried out but was prevented by circumstances (lack of means). This fits the definition of 'Attempt' which includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The ""almost committed"" due to lack of means signifies a thwarted attempt.
    *   ""yet i still consider"" indicates ongoing current ideation. However, the past *thwarted action* takes precedence for classification.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The phrase ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" is the strongest indicator. This is not merely expressing suicidal thoughts (Ideation) or having a plan (Behavior). It describes a past instance where the individual was ready to act, and the only thing that prevented the act was an external factor (lack of means). This constitutes a thwarted, self-initiated potentially lethal action, which falls under the 'Attempt' category. The definition specifically includes actions that were ""interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" Being prevented by lack of means is a form of interruption or failure to complete the action. The ongoing ""yet i still consider"" confirms current ideation, but the past *near-action* is the most severe and definitive element for classification.

165,suicide with me. can anyone suicide with me together. for those want to suicide too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly uses ""suicide"" multiple times.
    - Emotional indicators: Implies a profound desire to die, seeking companionship for this act.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no mention of pills, a location, or a specific action the author will take). It's an invitation, not a detailed plan for the author's own act.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: Not explicitly stated with a timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but the active invitation implies a current desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer clearly expresses a personal desire for suicide by asking others to join them (""suicide with me,"" ""can anyone suicide with me together,"" ""for those want to suicide too"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the phrase ""suicide with me"" clearly indicates a personal desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively seeking to act on them with others.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. There is no mention of *how* the suicide would be carried out by the author or jointly (e.g., ""let's jump,"" ""let's take pills"").
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context: While there's a strong desire and implied imminence, there is no *personal* action or method mentioned, only a general invitation for a joint act. The post does not contain a plan for *themselves*.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""can anyone suicide with me together"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire for suicide (""suicide with me,"" ""want to suicide too""). This rules out 'Indicator' because there is clear, personal suicidal intent and desire, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for carrying out the suicide (e.g., no mention of specific tools, locations, or actions the author will take). While it's an invitation for a joint act, it lacks the *how* for the author's own involvement. This absence of a specific plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for carrying it out.

    *   **Ideation:** No, because there is not only explicit suicidal thoughts/desire, but also a specific method and a past initiated action.
    *   **Behavior:** While there is clear current intent and a method (which would qualify for Behavior), the description of ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped"" describes a *past initiated action*.
    *   **Attempt:** The key phrase ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped"" describes a ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated action by the author that was potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" This action, even if called ""practice,"" involved physically engaging with a lethal method. The user initiated a potentially lethal action. The definition of 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author.

Final decision is 'Attempt' due to the clear description of a past initiated action involving a lethal method, even if it was a ""practice"" and stopped.

I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead. Then he will survive, then he won't need to work out a way to keep two people afloat with only his job. He'll only need to focus on himself and I'll finally be at peace. I told him today. I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post repeatedly states ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""finally going to actually do it,"" ""finally ready to do it,"" and ""It's finally fucking time,"" all implying an imminent suicidal act. It explicitly states ""violently suicidal,"" ""I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead,"" ""I'll finally be at peace"" (referring to death), ""suicidal ideation"" (past, from mom's perspective), ""I just want to fucking die,"" and ""I don't want to be here any more.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""sobbing,"" ""overwhelmed,"" ""fucking failure,"" ""burden,"" ""disappointed,"" ""couldn't stop crying,"" ""couldn't breathe.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" This is a specific method being considered, even if the exact execution is not fully decided. The high imminence (""finally doing it,"" ""finally time"") combined with this considered method is crucial.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions ""suicidal ideation"" in the past, but not a past *attempt* or initiated action.
    *   **Imminence:** Very high imminence: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""finally going to actually do it,"" ""finally ready to do it,"" ""It's finally fucking time.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die and end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""I just want to fucking die,"" and expresses a clear desire to die/not be alive.
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they express a strong desire to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method is mentioned as being considered: ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" While the exact ""how"" is still being deliberated, the mention of a specific means (gun) in the context of strong, imminent intent (""I'm finally doing it"") indicates more than just ideation. It's a method being contemplated for the imminent action. There are no explicit preparations mentioned like writing a note or acquiring the gun, but the contemplation of a specific method combined with high imminence is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current/future intention (""I'm finally doing it"").
    *   It mentions past ""suicidal ideation"" but does *not* describe any past specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author. Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to clear, explicit, and personal suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because a specific method (""get a gun"") is mentioned as being considered, even if the exact plan is not fully formed, and the imminence is very high. This goes beyond mere thoughts/desire.
    *   **Behavior:** This is the best fit. There is clear, strong, and imminent suicidal intent (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I just want to fucking die"") combined with the mention of a specific method being considered (""I've always thought I was going to get a gun""). The high imminence (""finally doing it,"" ""finally time"") suggests a strong intention to act, and the method provides the ""how.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past initiated suicidal action is described.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""end things"" (a clear euphemism for ending life), ""doesn't want me dead.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""apathetic about my existing,"" ""want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb,"" ""at the edge,"" ""pathetic?"" These indicate deep despair, a desire for escape, numbness, and a feeling of being on the brink.
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This describes a specific location chosen with a clear, lethal intent. The act of driving there is a preparatory action.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This describes an action (driving) that *just happened* with a specific suicidal intent.
    *   **Imminence:** The initial intent was ""full intentions to end things"" and the action of driving was *just completed*. The immediate follow-up ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" indicates a current pulling back from the immediate lethal act, but the recent strong intent and preparatory action are significant.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly had a desire to ""end things"" (die) as evidenced by the drive with that intention. While they are currently resisting the final act, the underlying desire for escape and the feeling of being ""at the edge"" persist.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end things"" and ""doesn't want me dead"" strongly imply a desire for death.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""full intentions to end things"" is a clear expression of a desire to die. The subsequent ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" indicates a current hesitation about *acting* on that desire, but not a negation of the desire itself or the previous intent. The desire for numbness (""sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb"") also points to a wish to escape life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? They state ""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" which is a statement about *not acting* *at this moment*, but the underlying desire and the *past action* (driving with intent) are still present. This is not an explicit statement of *unwanted* thoughts, but rather a moment of hesitation.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""driving up to the mountains"" is a specific location chosen with ""full intentions to end things."" While the specific *method* (e.g., jumping, overdose) is not stated, the *location* and the *intent* are clearly linked.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" is a concrete preparatory action taken towards a suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a very recent past event (""I just finished driving up..."") that was initiated with a specific, strong intention (""full intentions to end things""). It also describes a current state of mind (""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" ""I want to sleep and fast travel..."").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? The act of *driving* to a specific location with the *full intention to end things* is an initiated preparatory action towards a suicidal act. The final lethal action was not completed, as indicated by ""I don't think I'm going to do it.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""full intentions to end things,"" ""want to sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb"" as an escape). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. It's not 'Indicator'. It's at least 'Ideation'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post describes not just thoughts or a desire, but a *specific action* taken in furtherance of a suicidal plan: ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" Driving to a specific location with the *intent* to end one's life constitutes a preparatory action or an intended action. While the method isn't explicit, the *action of going to the location with intent* is a concrete step. This fits the 'Behavior' definition: ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations being taken."" The act of driving to the location with intent is a preparation/intended action. The statement ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" indicates a current pulling back from the *final act*, but does not negate the fact that the *preparatory action* (driving to the mountains with intent) *already happened*.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** An 'Attempt' requires a ""specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* by the author."" While driving to the mountains with intent is a serious step, it's a *preparatory* action. The *lethal action itself* (e.g., jumping, taking pills) was not initiated or completed. The post explicitly states ""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" confirming the lethal action was *not* initiated. Therefore, it's not an 'Attempt'.
    *   **Conclusion:** The post describes clear suicidal intent coupled with a concrete preparatory action (driving to a specific location with that intent). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""I'm ready to die"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""ready to go"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, hopelessness (""nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life"", ""Fuck this world"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""The date was set a while ago"", ""I even changed it"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"". These phrases strongly indicate planning and preparation for a suicidal act. While a specific method isn't named, the preparation aspect is explicit.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past *initiated* actions are mentioned. ""The date was set a while ago"" refers to a past *plan*, not an initiated attempt.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I'm ready to die"", ""ready to go"", ""strapped in and ready to go"" all suggest high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm ready to die"", ""ready to go"").
    *   There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not want to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, there are clear mentions of planning and preparation: ""The date was set a while ago"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"". These phrases indicate a plan and active preparation, even without specifying a method. The phrase ""strapped in and ready to go"" implies being in the final stages of executing a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current intentions and preparations for a future act.
    *   It does *not* describe a past, specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author. Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by explicitly mentioning a ""date was set"" and ""Preps being made"" and being ""strapped in and ready to go."" These are clear indications of planning and preparation for a suicidal act, which fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification as it includes explicit suicidal desire along with clear mentions of planning and preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The phrase ""Im thinking of ending my life"" is a direct mention of suicidal ideation.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post describes a history of academic struggles (""grades dropped,"" ""repeated secondary 4,"" ""kicked out of sch,"" ""bad maths grade,"" ""hate my course""), mental health issues (""severe ocd,"" ""depression,"" ""panic attack""), and social isolation (""loner,"" ""friends have all pretty much ditched me,"" ""left with only two good friends and five friends""). These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** The post details past life events and struggles (OCD development, academic failures, social isolation) but does not describe any past *suicidal actions* or attempts.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""Im thinking of ending my life"" indicates a current thought process.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The statement ""Im thinking of ending my life"" clearly expresses a personal desire or consideration of suicide, not merely distress about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""ending my life,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end or to not be alive, as evidenced by ""Im thinking of ending my life.""
    *   The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they are presented as a personal consideration.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no vague reference to an action that implies a method or plan, even with high imminence. The statement is about the *thought* of ending life, not the *how*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes past life events leading up to a current state of distress and a current intention/thought (""Im thinking of ending my life"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past. The past events are related to academic and social difficulties, not suicidal acts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal intent (""Im thinking of ending my life""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's more than just general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a personal consideration of suicide.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. This distinction is crucial for 'Behavior'. Since no plan/method/action is present, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does not describe any past self-initiated suicidal actions or attempts. Therefore, it does not fit the 'Attempt' category.
    *   Based on the explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts without any mention of a plan, method, or action, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

171,its working!. hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""hopefully this is my last post on here,"" ""pls let me never wake up."" These are clear expressions of a desire to die and for life to end.
    - Emotional indicators: Profound despair, hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No explicit method is named (e.g., ""pills,"" ""gun""). However, the phrase ""its working!"" strongly implies that a specific action has been initiated and is currently in progress, leading towards the desired outcome of death. This is not just a thought or a plan, but an ongoing action.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Very high. ""its working!"" indicates an immediate, ongoing action. ""last post"" and ""never wake up"" indicate an imminent desired outcome.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear and strong desire to die/not be alive.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up"" is a direct expression of wanting life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post indicates an active pursuit of death.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method is named.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. The phrase ""its working!"" is key here. It signifies that an action has been *initiated* and is *currently in progress* with the intent to cause death. While the *specifics* of the method are not given, the *initiation and progression* of an action are clearly stated. This moves beyond mere planning or intention and into active behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *current, ongoing action* (""its working!"") and a desired immediate future outcome (""last post,"" ""never wake up"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, it's current.
    - The phrase ""its working!"" indicates a self-initiated action that is currently underway and intended to be lethal. This aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' which includes ""very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal."" The post is a real-time update on an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator:** Ruled out due to clear personal suicidal intent and implied action.
    - **Ideation:** Ruled out because ""its working!"" indicates an action has been initiated, not just thoughts or desires.
    - **Behavior:** This category involves plans, methods, or preparations. While the post implies a method/action, the phrase ""its working!"" suggests the action has already *started* and is *ongoing*. This goes beyond a future plan or preparation.
    - **Attempt:** The definition includes ""very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal."" The phrase ""its working!"" coupled with the desire to ""never wake up"" strongly indicates that a potentially lethal action has been initiated by the author and is currently in progress. This fits the 'Attempt' category as a very recent, ongoing, self-initiated action.

The crucial phrase ""its working!"" indicates an action has been initiated and is currently in progress, aiming for a lethal outcome. This is not merely a plan or preparation (Behavior), but an action that has already begun, fitting the ""very recent, specific, self-initiated actions"" aspect of 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""saying im gonna do it,"" ""this time i actually have the means to,"" ""tonight im gonna do it,"" ""im so ready to die."" These are direct expressions of suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i feel like im always posting here,"" ""i dunno what kinds of pills these are, i think theyre my old antidepressants. which obviously didnt work haha,"" ""this doesnt make sense, im really out of it."" These indicate despair, disorientation, and a sense of resignation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""i have 42 unnamed pills,"" ""my old antidepressants,"" ""some allergy medicine,"" ""they're really small so its easy to swallow."" This explicitly details the means (pills) and how they would be used (easy swallowing). The possession of the pills is a preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"" refers to past *statements* of intent, not past *initiated actions* or attempts.
    *   **Imminence:** ""tonight im gonna do it."" This indicates a very high degree of imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""im so ready to die."" This is a clear, explicit desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post doesn't use the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but phrases like ""gonna do it"" and ""ready to die"" are clear, direct expressions of suicidal intent and a desire for life to end.
    *   There is no negation of these thoughts; the writer explicitly states their readiness to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""42 unnamed pills,"" ""my old antidepressants,"" ""some allergy medicine."" The act of swallowing them is implied.
    *   Yes, there are signs of preparation: the user *has* the pills (""i have 42 unnamed pills"") and notes their ease of swallowing, indicating contemplation of their use as a means.
    *   Given the explicit desire to die and high imminence (""tonight im gonna do it""), the mention of having the pills and their characteristics strongly implies a concrete plan/method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current possession of means and a future, imminent intention (""tonight im gonna do it"").
    *   It does *not* describe a past initiated, potentially lethal action. The phrase ""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"" refers to past *statements* of intent, not past *attempts*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal intent (""im so ready to die,"" ""tonight im gonna do it""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by mentioning a specific method (""42 unnamed pills,"" ""old antidepressants,"" ""allergy medicine"") that the user possesses, and a clear, imminent intention to use them (""tonight im gonna do it""). This constitutes a plan and intended action, fitting the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past initiated action is described. The user is describing a future intended action.

Therefore, the post falls under 'Behavior'.

    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While there's strong desire and increasing frequency of thoughts, there's no vague reference to an action beyond the general ""kill myself"" that would imply a specific, but unstated, method or plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a growing, present/future intention/thought (""More and more often it feels like the only way... would be to just be done and kill myself"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""kill myself,"" ""I want to be done""). This clearly moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations (no ""how"" or ""with what""). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The core elements are the explicit suicidal ideation and desire to die, without any actionable plan.

174,I'm truly running on nothing but shear spite at this point. I really want to check out. I can not really express how much I want to check out at this point. The only thing that seems to be holding me here at this point is shear spite. It is not that I have any moral problem with suicide at this point or even care about what me unexpectedly checking out would do to the other in my life but it just seems like such a waste to go out this way when I have held on for so long but I have come to realize recently that even spite has its limits.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""check out"" is used repeatedly as a euphemism for dying/suicide (""I really want to check out,"" ""unexpectedly checking out""). The post also explicitly states ""I have no moral problem with suicide at this point.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""running on nothing but shear spite,"" ""cannot really express how much I want to check out,"" ""spite has its limits."" This indicates severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and a weakening of the only remaining reason to live.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""at this point,"" ""recently,"" ""spite has its limits."" This suggests a current and intensifying desire, with the last barrier (spite) weakening. While not immediate like ""tonight,"" it indicates a deteriorating state.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a very clear and strong desire to ""check out"" (die). The author explicitly states a lack of moral objection to suicide and indifference to the impact on others, reinforcing the genuine desire to end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""moral problem with suicide"" is explicitly mentioned, and ""check out"" is clearly used as a direct euphemism for suicide/death.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I really want to check out,"" ""how much I want to check out.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true. The writer expresses a strong personal desire to die and a lack of objection to acting on it.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While the desire is strong and the imminence is increasing (spite reaching its limits), there is no mention or implication of *how* they would ""check out,"" only the desire *to* ""check out.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, ongoing, and intensifying desire.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post contains a clear, personal, and strong expression of suicidal desire (""I really want to check out,"" ""no moral problem with suicide""). This is not general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    - **Ideation vs. Behavior:** There is a clear desire to die and explicit suicidal intent. However, there is no mention whatsoever of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. The post focuses solely on the desire and the weakening of the last barrier. Without any ""how"" or ""what"" in terms of action, it remains 'Ideation'.
    - **Behavior vs. Attempt:** There is no description of any past *initiated action* that was potentially lethal. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on this analysis, the post clearly expresses strong suicidal ideation without any specific plan or action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""im going to do it"" strongly implies a suicidal act in this context. ""im done"" reinforces this.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im in so much pain and i cant handle it anymore,"" ""i cant. i cant."" These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or location is mentioned. However, the closing remarks (""thank you to the people i met thru this sub. and i hope everyone finds something to live for."") function as a farewell message, which is a form of preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""im going to do it"" indicates high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die/end life, expressed through ""im going to do it"" and ""im done,"" coupled with the farewell.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly, but ""im going to do it"" in this context is a direct statement of suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""im going to do it,"" ""im done,"" and the farewell message clearly express this.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer states they *are* going to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method is stated.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the farewell message (""thank you to the people... and i hope everyone finds something to live for."") is a strong sign of preparation.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. ""Im going to do it"" is an explicit statement of *intended action*. Combined with the farewell message (preparation) and high imminence, this aligns with the 'Behavior' definition.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""im going to do it"").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   This is clearly beyond 'Indicator' as there is a direct personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die.
    *   It is more than 'Ideation' because it includes a statement of *intended action* (""im going to do it"") and a clear sign of *preparation* (the farewell message). The 'Behavior' definition includes ""an intended action (even if the method is vague, like 'want to make the pain physical,' especially if coupled with high imminence), or preparations being taken."" The phrase ""im going to do it"" is a clear intended action, and the farewell is a preparation, both with high imminence.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past initiated suicidal action is described.

Therefore, the combination of direct intent (""im going to do it""), high imminence, and a clear farewell message (preparation) places this post in the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""kill myself"" is explicitly stated. The phrase ""painless way"" is a direct inquiry about a method.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""lot of stress,"" ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""never really seen myself going anywhere in life,"" ""why not."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post asks ""What is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"". This is a direct solicitation for a method, which implies seeking a plan or means to act.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** While not explicitly ""tonight"" or ""now,"" the active inquiry for a method suggests a current and potentially imminent intent to act once a method is found.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, genuine wish to die and for life to end (""kill myself,"" ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""why not""). This is not expressing distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts; it's a desire to act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""never really seen myself going anywhere in life,"" ""why not.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively seeking a method to act on these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? The post *asks* for a specific method (""What is a mostly painless way to kill myself?""). While the user hasn't *chosen* a method yet, the act of *seeking* a method is a crucial step towards planning and execution. This goes beyond mere ideation.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The inquiry for a method can be considered a form of preparation or active planning.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The direct question ""What is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"" is a clear indication of seeking a *how-to*, which is a strong step towards a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention, as the user is actively seeking a method to act.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. There is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and an active search for a method, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect. While it includes ideation, it goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by actively seeking a *method* to carry out the act. This active inquiry for a method is a step towards planning.
    *   **Behavior:** Correct. The post expresses a clear desire to die (""kill myself"") and actively seeks information about a specific method (""What is a mostly painless way to kill myself?""). This active search for a method constitutes an element of planning or seeking to implement a plan, fitting the definition of 'Behavior' which includes mentioning a plan, method, or intended action. The inquiry for a method is a direct step towards action.
    *   **Attempt:** Incorrect. No past initiated action is described.

The active search for a method (""What is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"") moves this from Ideation to Behavior, as it indicates a step towards planning or preparing to act.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** The post explicitly mentions ""overdosing,"" ""suicide,"" ""die,"" ""end it with pills."" It details the physical consequences of an overdose.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post does not convey the author's personal emotional state (e.g., hopelessness, despair). It's written in an informative, cautionary, and somewhat graphic tone, aiming to deter.
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** A method (pills/overdosing) is discussed, but it's presented as a general concept and its negative consequences, not as a personal plan or preparation by the author. The author explicitly states ""Don't take the pills.""
    *   **References to past actions:** No references to the author's past actions.
    *   **Imminence:** No stated intentions or imminence from the author regarding self-harm.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer's clear desire is to *discourage* others from using overdose as a method of suicide by explaining its painful and often non-fatal outcomes. There is no personal desire to die expressed by the author.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""commit suicide,"" ""result in suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The author is describing the *unpleasantness* of dying by overdose, seemingly to deter others, not expressing a personal desire. The repeated ""Don't take the pills"" is a clear negation of action.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The post is not about the author's suicidal thoughts. It's a warning to others. The phrase ""Don't take the pills"" is a clear negation of action for anyone considering it.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""pills,"" ""overdosing"" as a method. However, this is *not* in the context of the author's own plan or preparation. It's a descriptive warning about a method's consequences.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes the *consequences* of a potential future action (overdosing) for a hypothetical person, not the author's own past, current, or future action.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses suicide and a specific method (overdosing) but does so in an *abstract, cautionary, informative way*, not as a personal expression of suicidal intent, ideation, or action by the author.
    *   The author explicitly states, ""I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die."" and ends with ""Don't take the pills."" This is a clear attempt to *deter* others from suicide by overdose, not an expression of personal suicidal thoughts or plans.
    *   It lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.
    *   It does not express the author's own suicidal thoughts, desire to die, or plans/actions. It's a general discussion *about* suicide methods and their negative consequences. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""im positive im gonna do it the the future"", ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""mental health issues"", ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""fed up of this"". These indicate hopelessness and despair.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: Mentions ""mental health issues way before the pandemic started"" but no past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: ""in the future"", ""when im fed up of this"", ""im good rn"". This indicates a future, non-immediate intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/end life (""im positive im gonna do it"", ""no motivation to keep on living""). The only deterrent is family sadness, not a lack of personal desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""im positive im gonna do it"" in context strongly implies suicide.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, they state they *will* do it.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Is there a vague reference to action implying a method/plan? No. The intent is future and vague, not immediate and action-oriented.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""in the future"", ""when im fed up of this"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and a future intent to act on it (""im positive im gonna do it"", ""no motivation to keep on living""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out the suicidal intent. The intent is stated as being ""in the future"" and ""when im fed up,"" which lacks the imminence or specificity required for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/desire to die without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""fucking hate,"" ""psychologically tortured,"" ""couldn't even find the time to care."" These indicate extreme emotional distress, anger, and feelings of neglect/suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: Describes past parental actions and the current resulting state of being ""psychologically tortured."" No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses profound unhappiness and suffering (""living a life psychologically tortured"") due to their existence, but does not explicitly state a desire to die or for life to end. The focus is on the pain of living, not a wish to cease living.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. While the phrase ""I fucking hate my parents for having me"" and ""living a life psychologically tortured"" indicates extreme distress and regret about being alive, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or for life to end. It describes the agony of their current existence, not a wish for its cessation.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Not applicable, as no explicit desire to die is present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past parental actions leading to a current state of psychological torture. No suicidal actions are described.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly indicates severe emotional distress, suffering, and regret about being born. However, it *lacks* any explicit personal expression of a desire to die, suicidal thoughts, or a wish for life to end. It describes the pain of living (""psychologically tortured"") but not a direct intent or wish to stop living.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to die. Phrases like ""I hate my parents for having me"" and ""living a life psychologically tortured"" express profound unhappiness with life, but not a direct desire to end it.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no plan, method, or intended action.
    - It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as there is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action.

There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post describes a dream involving ""mass murdering people"" and ""slicing up as many people as they could."" This involves death and violence, but it is explicitly stated as a *dream* and the violence is perpetrated by *others* on *other people* and the dreamer. There is no mention of the author wanting to harm themselves or die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""severe panic attack,"" ""absolutely terrified me,"" ""sheer panic,"" ""absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake,"" ""anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense."" These indicate high levels of fear, anxiety, and distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None related to self-harm or suicide. The plans/methods described are those of the dream attackers.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past self-harm or suicidal actions are mentioned by the author. The ""past action"" is the dream itself.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No suicidal intentions are stated. The imminence relates to the ongoing anxiety about sleeping due to the dream.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer's desire is to understand the dream and find ways to ""deal with it so I can avoid them [intense dreams] as I've been anxious to sleep."" The desire is to alleviate distress caused by the dream, not to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The post is focused on the terror and anxiety caused by a dream.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The methods described (slicing, rampage) are part of the dream and are actions of others, not self-inflicted.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past dream and the current anxiety and fear resulting from it.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses significant distress, panic, and anxiety.
    *   However, there is absolutely no mention of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, or any form of self-harm. The distress is explicitly linked to a terrifying dream and its aftermath.
    *   The user is seeking help to understand and cope with the dream and the resulting anxiety, not expressing suicidal intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrases ""what comes after,"" ""so i can do it,"" and ""reason to end this suffering"" strongly imply suicidal intent. Crucially, ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"" explicitly mentions a past method (""overdosed"") and a past intentional suicidal act (""once on purpose"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fear and despair,"" ""suffering.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No *current* specific plan, method, or preparation for a *future* act is detailed. However, a past method and action are clearly stated.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"" is a direct reference to past self-initiated actions, one of which was intentional for suicidal purposes.
    *   **Imminence:** The phrases ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" and ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" indicate a current desire to act, contingent on finding a reason/strength.

    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but the intent is strongly implied by ""so i can do it"" and ""reason to end this suffering.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""reason to end this suffering"" and the desire to ""do it.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is present and active.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Not for a *current* plan. However, a *past* method (""overdosed"") is explicitly stated in relation to a past suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. It describes a past initiated suicidal action (""ive overdosed twice... once on purpose"") and current ideation/desire to act (""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes, ""ive overdosed twice... once on purpose"" clearly describes a past, self-initiated, intentional, potentially lethal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains elements of 'Ideation' due to the current desire to ""end this suffering"" and ""do it.""
    *   However, the most definitive and concrete information provided is the explicit description of a past self-initiated suicidal attempt: ""ive overdosed twice... once on purpose.""
    *   According to the definitions, 'Attempt' applies when ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical... if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" This post perfectly fits this definition as the author describes a past intentional overdose in the context of their current suffering and desire to end it.
    *   The rule also states: ""'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.""

Based on the explicit mention of a past intentional overdose, 'Attempt' is the most accurate classification.

182,I thought I was getting better. for the past few weeks I've been happy just to be spending time with my partner without any bad days. I thought I was finally getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again. I've run out of meds and I asked for an urgent refill a few days ago but my doctors/pharmacy never got back to me. I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm suicidal again.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I'm hurting,"" ""low mood,"" ""scared to stress him even more.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""suicidal again"" implies a history of suicidal thoughts/feelings, but not a past *attempt* (initiated action). ""I thought I was getting better"" refers to a past emotional state.
    - Imminence: ""all of a sudden I'm suicidal again"" indicates a current return of these thoughts.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I'm suicidal again"" clearly expresses the presence of personal suicidal thoughts/feelings. There is no negation (e.g., ""I don't want these thoughts"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal again.""
    - Yes, this phrase expresses a clear desire or presence of suicidal thoughts.
    - No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned in relation to a suicidal act.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - The mention of ""run out of meds"" is a contributing factor to their current distress and the return of suicidal thoughts, not a plan for an overdose. There is no stated intent to use the lack of meds or any other substance as a method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current state (""I'm suicidal again"").
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past. ""Suicidal again"" refers to the recurrence of the *state* of being suicidal (thoughts/feelings), not a past *attempt*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal intent (""I'm suicidal again""), not just general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts.
    - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. The lack of medication is a circumstance, not a plan.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the post does not describe any past or very recent initiated action that was potentially lethal. The phrase ""suicidal again"" refers to the return of ideation, not a past attempt.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it clearly expresses suicidal thoughts/feelings without any specific plan or action.

    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""Everytime I try I fail."" This refers to general attempts at coping or improving, not past suicidal actions. No mention of past suicidal attempts.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""now I want to die more than ever."" This indicates a current and strong desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die, not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to die more than ever,"" and ""I can't have this life it's too painful.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a personal feeling.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, does even a vague reference to action imply a method or plan? No specific action or method is implied beyond the strong desire to die.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current feelings and intentions (""now I want to die more than ever,"" ""I can't have this life"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. ""Everytime I try I fail"" refers to general life struggles or attempts to improve, not past suicidal actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I want to die more than ever,"" ""I can't have this life it's too painful""). This rules out 'Indicator' as it's not vague distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts; it's a clear personal desire.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for carrying out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action by the author. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die, but without any specific plan, method, or intended action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""suicide by hanging"" and ""tied the noose.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""still not sure"" (ambivalence), ""don't want lied to"" (seeking honest information, indicating serious consideration).
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""tied the noose"" is a direct and concrete preparation for a specific method (""hanging""). The question itself (""Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?"") is about the specifics of the act.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The preparation (""tied the noose"") suggests high imminence, even with the stated ambivalence (""still not sure""). The focus is on the act itself.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer has taken a preparatory step and is seeking information about the experience of the act, which strongly implies a personal desire to die, despite hesitation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""suicide by hanging.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, the act of tying the noose and asking about the experience of hanging implies a clear desire to consider or carry out the act.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the writer is seeking information *about* the act, having already prepared.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act?** Yes, ""hanging"" is the specific method, and ""noose"" is the tool.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""tied the noose"" is a clear sign of preparation.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context.** Here, the method is explicit (""hanging"") and the preparation is explicit (""tied the noose"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes a current state of preparation (""tied the noose"") and contemplation of a future action (""Is suicide by hanging...?"").
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No. The noose is tied, but the act of hanging has not been initiated or attempted.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and mentions ""suicide by hanging,"" ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by explicitly stating a specific method (""hanging"") and a concrete preparation (""tied the noose""). This rules out 'Ideation'.
    *   It describes a current state of preparation for a specific suicidal act, including a method and a preparatory step. This perfectly fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action that was potentially lethal. The author has prepared, but not yet acted or attempted. This rules out 'Attempt'.

The presence of a specific method (""hanging"") and a concrete preparation (""tied the noose""), coupled with the clear suicidal intent, places this firmly in the 'Behavior' category.

    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The phrases ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die"" indicate current ideation and desire, but no immediate timeframe or specific action is stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear desire to die is expressed (""I want to die""). The question ""Should I kill myself?"" indicates contemplation of suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die"").

    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - There is no vague reference to action that implies a method or plan, even with high imminence, as imminence is not explicitly high (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").

    - The post describes a current desire and contemplation (""Should I kill myself?"", ""I want to die"").
    - It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and contemplates suicide (""I want to die,"" ""Should I kill myself?""). This rules out 'Indicator' as it's more than general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's explicit suicidal intent.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" is present, which is a common euphemism for ending one's life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""i hate my dad,"" ""i hate my family so much,"" ""i hate him so much,"" ""i hate everything."" These indicate extreme distress, anger, and hopelessness. The context of sexual assault trauma adds to the severity of the emotional pain.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""i just wanna end it"" expresses a current desire, but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is given.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Imminence is not explicitly high, and there is no vague reference to *how* they would ""end it.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire to ""end it.""

And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""anyone on the brink of suicide""). It also mentions feeling like ""I couldn't cope.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""felt like I couldn't cope.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No plans, methods, or preparations for *suicide* are mentioned. The post details an *alternative* coping strategy (going hobo/vagrant).
    *   **References to past actions:** The author states, ""On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant."" This was presented as an *alternative* to suicide, not a suicidal action. They also say ""the road has saved me in the past.""
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The post is about an *alternative* to suicide. The author explicitly states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment,"" and ""it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again."" This indicates a lack of current suicidal intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer is offering an alternative to suicide, implying a desire to *avoid* suicide and cope differently. There is no current desire to die expressed. The past feelings of being ""on the brink of suicide"" were explicitly mitigated by choosing an alternative.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""brink of suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The post offers an *alternative* to suicide and states the author is currently ""functional."" The mention of ""brink of suicide"" refers to past feelings, which were then mitigated by choosing an alternative.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The post doesn't describe current suicidal thoughts, but rather past moments ""on the brink"" and how they *avoided* acting on them by choosing an alternative. This strongly suggests a lack of current desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The methods/locations mentioned (e.g., ""living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes"") are for *going vagrant*, which is presented as a *life-saving alternative* to suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past feelings (""felt like I couldn't cope,"" ""on two of those occasions I hit the road"") and how the ""road has saved me in the past."" It also speaks to the present (""I am a functional member of society at the moment"") and a potential future need (""should I ever need it again"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The past actions described (""hit the road and went vagrant"") were *alternatives* to suicide, not suicidal actions themselves.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses suicide as a concept and refers to past moments of personal distress where the author felt ""on the brink."" However, crucially, the author explicitly states they chose an *alternative* to suicide (""the road has saved me in the past"") and are currently ""functional."" There is no current personal expression of suicidal intent or desire to die. The discussion of suicide is in the context of offering a coping strategy to *avoid* it.
    *   This does not fit 'Ideation' because there is no current personal expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to die. The past feelings were overcome by an alternative.
    *   It does not fit 'Behavior' because there is no plan, method, or intended action for suicide.
    *   It does not fit 'Attempt' because no past suicidal action was initiated. The actions described were coping mechanisms *instead* of suicide.
    *   It best fits 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress (past tense) and discusses suicide abstractly (as a problem for others ""on the brink"") while offering a solution, without expressing a current personal desire for death.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""end it"" is a direct euphemism for suicide in this context. ""I can't go on anymore"" expresses a desire for life to end. ""I think this is it"" suggests finality.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""life has been getting worse,"" ""addiction for years,"" ""drunk,"" ""so lonely,"" ""fucked up my life,"" ""miss outside,"" ""miss being happy."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, loneliness, regret, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (like pills, gun) is named. However, the phrase ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" indicates a clear intention to act, with high imminence (""tonight"") and a preparatory element (""be drunk and happy""). Being drunk is a state they intend to be in before ""ending it,"" which can be considered a form of preparation or a precursor to the intended action. The phrase ""I think this is it mfs"" also conveys a sense of immediate decision and finality.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""tonight,"" ""this is it."" High imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die/end life (""can't go on anymore,"" ""end it"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""end it"" is a clear and direct expression of suicidal intent in this context. ""I can't go on anymore"" also expresses a desire for life to cease.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the desire is clearly personal and intended.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No explicit method like ""pills"" or ""gun."" However, the statement ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" implies an intended action (""end it"") with high imminence (""tonight"") and a preparatory state (""be drunk and happy""). The definition of Behavior includes ""an intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence), or preparations being taken."" The ""drunk and happy"" state before ""ending it"" can be seen as a preparation. This goes beyond mere ideation because it includes a temporal commitment and a precursor state.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A clear future intention (""tonight I'm just gonna... then end it"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   This is clearly not 'Indicator' as there is a strong, personal, and explicit desire to die.
    *   This is not 'Attempt' as it describes a future intention, not a past initiated action.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is suicidal thoughts/desire *without* a plan, method, or intended action.
        *   'Behavior' is suicidal thoughts/desire *with* a plan, method, intended action, or preparations.
    *   The post includes a clear desire to die (""can't go on anymore,"" ""end it""). It also includes a temporal commitment (""tonight"") and a stated sequence of events (""be drunk and happy and then end it""). While a specific method is not named, ""end it"" is the intended action, and ""be drunk and happy"" serves as a preparatory state/action before the final act. This combination of strong intent, high imminence, and a stated precursor/preparation for an intended action fits the 'Behavior' definition.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""end my life"" is a direct statement of suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The question ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" implies profound despair and a desire for death.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen."" This specifies substances and a quantity, indicating a method (overdose). The question about successfulness directly relates to using these means to end life. ""Have"" and ""access to"" imply possession/readiness.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.

    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; they are actively seeking information on how to achieve the desired outcome.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method/substance (""800mg codeine and ibuprofen"") is mentioned in relation to a suicidal act.
    *   Yes, having ""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"" indicates possession/readiness of means, which constitutes preparation. The question about efficacy further solidifies the intent to use these means.

The user has the means and is considering using them.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past initiated action is described.

The presence of explicit suicidal intent (""end my life"") combined with the mention of specific means/method (""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"") and the inquiry about their efficacy for suicide clearly points to 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""why should i live,"" ""desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""can't do this anymore,"" ""can't live like this for the rest of my life,"" ""can't stand being here any other moment,"" ""can't imagine myself living another year this way."" These phrases strongly indicate a desire for life to end or not to be alive. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""failed everything,"" ""wasted it,"" ""not happy,"" ""not enjoying anything,"" ""suffer everyday,"" ""never been happy since birth."" These convey profound hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, and a sense of failure.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""resisting the desire to end"" indicates a long-standing internal struggle against suicidal thoughts, but not a past *initiated* suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""can't do this anymore,"" ""can't stand being here any other moment,"" ""can't imagine myself living another year this way."" The imminence of the *desire* for life to end is very high.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and strong desire for life to end, not to be alive. The resistance mentioned (""resisting the desire to end"") seems to be a past state, with the current state being one of giving up that resistance (""can't do this anymore"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, strongly implied through phrases like ""why should i live,"" ""desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""can't do this anymore,"" ""can't live like this,"" ""can't stand being here any other moment,"" ""can't imagine myself living another year.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the current sentiment is one of profound despair and wanting life to end, not a negation of the desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. While the desire and imminence are high, there is no reference to *any* action or *how* the pain would end, even vaguely.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current profound distress and future inability to continue living this way.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. ""Resisting the desire to end"" is an internal struggle, not an initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses clear, strong, and personal suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end (""why should i live,"" ""desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""can't do this anymore,"" ""can't live like this,"" ""can't stand being here,"" ""can't imagine myself living another year""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it goes beyond general distress and is a clear personal expression of suicidal desire, and the desire is not explicitly unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end, without any specific plan or action.

191,SMI. How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly uses the phrase ""commit suicide.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The phrasing ""you will probably commit suicide eventually"" suggests a deep-seated belief or expectation of future suicide, indicating profound hopelessness or despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations are mentioned. The question is about *how to tell people*, not *how to do it*.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions (attempts) are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** ""Eventually"" indicates a non-immediate, future timeframe, but the certainty (""will probably"") is significant.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrasing ""you will probably commit suicide eventually"" implies a personal conviction or acceptance of this outcome, indicating a genuine desire for life to end or an expectation of it, rather than distress about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""commit suicide.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, ""you will probably commit suicide eventually"" expresses a personal expectation and acceptance of suicide as an outcome, which implies a desire for life to end, even if not immediate.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts?** No, the post does not negate the desire or state the thoughts are unwanted. It poses a question about communicating this perceived future inevitability.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan:** Imminence is not high (""eventually""). No vague action is implied beyond the general act of suicide itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes a future intention/expectation (""will probably commit suicide eventually"").
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""will probably commit suicide eventually""). This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide. It is not framed as unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is stronger than 'Indicator'.
    *   While there is clear suicidal intent, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations being taken. The question is about communication, not execution. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated suicidal action. This distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer... but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

Will anyone read this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself."" This is a direct mention of suicidal thoughts/commands.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""losing grip with it all,"" ""can't stop crying,"" ""can't cope with his own mistakes,"" ""Why won't god talk to me? I cry out for him to show me a solution."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned. Financial mistakes are past, but not suicidal.
    *   **Imminence:** The ""voices... keep telling me"" implies ongoing intrusive thoughts.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** This is crucial. While ""end myself"" is mentioned, it's attributed to ""voices"" and immediately countered by ""I wanna see my daughters grow up."" This strongly suggests that the suicidal thoughts are intrusive and *unwanted*, and do not represent the author's personal desire to die. He expresses a desire to live for his daughters.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""end myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. While the phrase ""end myself"" is present, it's attributed to ""voices"" and directly countered by a clear desire to live (""I wanna see my daughters grow up""). This indicates that the suicidal thoughts are *unwanted* or intrusive, rather than a personal desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I wanna see my daughters grow up"" serves as an explicit counter-desire to the intrusive thoughts of ""end myself."" This fits the 'Indicator' definition's caveat for unwanted thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current distress and ongoing intrusive thoughts.
    *   It does not describe any past, current, or future specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a direct reference to suicidal thoughts (""end myself"").
    *   However, the critical element is the context: ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"" followed by ""I wanna see my daughters grow up."" This indicates that the suicidal thoughts are intrusive and *unwanted*, and the author expresses a desire to live.
    *   This perfectly aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The desire to see his daughters grow up functions as this explicit statement of not wanting to act on the thoughts.
    *   There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Because the personal desire to die is negated by the desire to live for his daughters, it does not fit 'Ideation', which requires a *clear, current, personal expression of desire to die*.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""maybe I don't need to die."" This indicates that the concept of dying has been a consideration for the author.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""abusive ex is gone,"" ""mental health stuff,"" ""not okay right now"" indicate distress. However, the post starts with ""a hopeful thought"" and expresses hope for finding care and being ""okay"" one day. The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" is presented as part of this hopeful thought.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No imminent intentions to die are stated. The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" suggests a shift away from that idea.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a desire for care, to be okay, and explicitly questions the necessity of dying (""maybe I don't need to die""). This indicates a leaning *away* from a desire to die, or a struggle where they are trying to overcome such thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No, it uses ""die.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" is a negation of the *need* to die, presented as a hopeful thought. It implies that dying was a consideration, but the current sentiment is moving away from it.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Yes, ""maybe I don't need to die"" strongly implies that the idea of dying is something they are trying to move away from, or that they are questioning its necessity. This fits the description of unwanted thoughts or a shift away from suicidal desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned.
    *   No signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and future hopes. There are no descriptions of past or current initiated actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly indicates that the idea of dying has been present for the author (""maybe I don't need to die""). This means it's not just general distress without any suicidal thoughts.
    *   However, the phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" is framed as a ""hopeful thought"" and represents a questioning or negation of the *need* to die. This is not an expression of a current personal desire to die. Instead, it aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die**."" The author is expressing a desire to *not* die, or to overcome the need to die.
    *   There is no plan, method, preparation, or past attempt mentioned.
    *   Therefore, the post expresses distress and acknowledges the presence of thoughts about dying, but ultimately expresses a hopeful shift away from those thoughts, fitting the 'Indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""i dont wanna die rn"", ""suicidal thoughts are always there"", ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""i just wanna be calm rn because im bored"".
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""taking 3 xanax pills"" is a specific method. ""i will do it anyway"" indicates a strong intention to take the pills. The question ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" directly links the intended action to lethality.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""rn"" (right now) for wanting to be calm and the potential action. ""always there"" for suicidal thoughts. ""i will do it anyway"" suggests immediate or very near-future intent to act.
    - Stated desire: The user explicitly states ""i dont wanna die rn"". However, this is immediately followed by ""when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there"" and a direct question about the lethality of a specific action (""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"") that they state ""i will do it anyway"". While the immediate desire to die is negated, the presence of persistent suicidal thoughts combined with the intent to take a specific substance and inquire about its lethal potential, indicates a high-risk situation where a specific action is being contemplated/intended in the context of suicidal ideation. The inquiry about dying from the pills suggests that death is a consideration, even if not the primary stated goal *at this moment*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts are always there"".
    - The post expresses ""i dont wanna die rn"", which is a negation of immediate desire to die. However, the user then asks ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" and states ""dont tell me not to do this bc i will do it anyway"". This indicates that while they might not *want* to die *right now*, they are contemplating an action with known lethal potential (which they are inquiring about) within the context of persistent suicidal thoughts. This is not merely distress about unwanted thoughts; it's an exploration of a specific action linked to suicide. The presence of suicidal thoughts combined with the inquiry about lethality of a specific method they intend to use, outweighs the ""i dont wanna die rn"" for classification purposes, as the risk is still present and being explored through action.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - A specific method is mentioned: ""3 xanax pills"".
    - An intended action is stated: ""i will do it anyway"" (referring to taking the pills).
    - The inquiry ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" directly links this specific method and intended action to the potential for death/suicide. This confirms the presence of a specific method and an intended action within the context of suicidal thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention to take pills.
    - No past initiated action is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator:** While ""i dont wanna die rn"" might initially point here, the presence of ""suicidal thoughts are always there,"" a specific method (""3 xanax pills""), and a stated intent to act on it (""i will do it anyway""), coupled with an inquiry about its lethality, goes beyond general distress or purely unwanted thoughts. The user is actively engaging with a specific means that has suicidal implications.
    - **Ideation:** There are clear suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts are always there""). However, the post goes beyond mere thoughts by mentioning a specific method (""3 xanax pills"") and a stated intention to use it (""i will do it anyway""), along with an inquiry about its lethal potential. This moves it into the 'Behavior' category.
    - **Behavior:** The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts are always there""). It also mentions a specific method (""3 xanax pills"") and an intended action (""i will do it anyway""). The question ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" directly links this intended action to the potential for suicide. Despite the ""i dont wanna die rn"" statement, the user is clearly contemplating and intending to act on a specific method that they are inquiring about its lethal effects, all within the context of persistent suicidal thoughts. This fits the definition of Behavior, as there is a specific method and an intended action.
    - **Attempt:** No past initiated action is described.

Conclusion: The presence of persistent suicidal thoughts, a specific method (3 xanax pills), and a stated intention to take them, combined with an inquiry about their lethality, strongly points to 'Behavior', even with the temporary negation of the desire to die.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicit mention of ""self harmed"" (seeking methods/locations) and ""kill myself"" (conditional intent).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""shitface,"" ""fucking monster,"" ""piece of human garbage,"" ""hurt me,"" ""don't know what to do,"" ""hurt my friend."" Indicates severe self-loathing, despair, and guilt.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" is a direct inquiry about methods/locations for self-harm, implying an intent to act and seeking information to facilitate it. For suicide, the intent ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"" is conditional, but no specific method is mentioned for the suicide itself.
    *   **References to past actions:** None related to suicide or self-harm.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The self-harm inquiry is current and immediate (seeking information now). The suicide intent is conditional on an external event (""if he is dead"") and indicates a future action (""will wait until I can"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to self-harm and a conditional desire to kill self.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself.""
    *   Is the desire negated/unwanted? No, it's a stated personal intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? For self-harm, the user is *asking for* specific locations/methods (""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing""). This is an active step in seeking a method for an intended self-injurious action. While self-harm is not always suicidal, the context of ""kill myself"" later in the post links it to overall self-destructive intent. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions... a specific method, an intended action... or preparations being taken."" Seeking information on *how* to self-harm falls under seeking a method for an intended action.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Seeking methods for self-harm can be considered a form of preparation or active planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current intention to self-harm (seeking methods) and future conditional intention to kill self.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation (""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself""). This alone would be Ideation.
    *   However, the question ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" goes beyond mere ideation. It's an active step of seeking information for *how* to carry out a self-injurious act. This falls under the 'Behavior' definition, which includes mentioning a ""specific method"" or an ""intended action"" or ""preparations being taken."" Seeking a method for self-harm is a direct step towards an intended action. Even if the self-harm is not explicitly suicidal, it indicates a concrete step towards self-harm, which is a form of self-injurious behavior, and is presented in a context of suicidal thoughts. The presence of a search for a method/plan for *any* self-injurious behavior, coupled with suicidal ideation, pushes it into the 'Behavior' category.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   There is clear personal suicidal intent and a search for a method for self-harm, so it's not 'Indicator'.

Therefore, the combination of explicit suicidal ideation and actively seeking methods for self-harm fits the 'Behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""Im probably going to kill myself soon."" ""I just wish i wasn't even born to begin with.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""feeling a really strong urge,"" ""dont care,"" ""dont make any effort to keep me around,"" ""life is fucking stupid."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, and a strong desire to end life.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""soon,"" ""lately,"" ""strong urge."" This indicates current and relatively high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die and end life. Not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""Im probably going to kill myself soon,"" ""I just wish i wasn't even born to begin with.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is personal and direct.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While ""going to kill myself soon"" implies an action, it does not provide any specific *how* or *what* beyond the general act of suicide. There is no mention of ""making the pain physical"" or ""doing something"" that would imply a specific type of action or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""Im probably going to kill myself soon"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""Im probably going to kill myself soon,"" ""I just wish i wasn't even born to begin with""). This is not general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    - **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation and intent. However, it *lacks* any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. While the imminence is high (""soon,"" ""strong urge""), the post does not provide any details about *how* the suicide would be carried out (e.g., specific method, tool, location, or preparatory steps). The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations."" Without any of these elements, it remains 'Ideation'.
    - **Behavior vs. Attempt:** There is no description of a past *initiated action* by the author. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

Conclusion: The post expresses clear, personal suicidal intent and desire to die with high imminence, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""plummet to the ground,"" ""corpse."" These clearly describe a suicidal act.
    - Emotional indicators: ""so tempted,"" ""guilt,"" ""fear."" The ""tempted"" indicates a personal desire/inclination towards the act.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" is a specific method (jumping) and location (highest floor).
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""so tempted to just go"" suggests a strong current inclination, though not necessarily immediate action.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire/temptation to die, despite internal conflict about the consequences (""if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear""). The desire to die is present and specific.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but the description ""plummet to the ground"" and ""corpse"" in this context leaves no ambiguity about suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" expresses a clear desire to end life via a specific method.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the writer is expressing the *temptation* to act on the thoughts, not that the thoughts themselves are unwanted. The conflict is about the *consequences* of the act, not the desire for the act itself.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" clearly specifies a method (jumping) and a location (highest floor).
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations mentioned, but the method and location are clear.
    - If explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context: The desire is present and the method is specific, not vague.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current temptation/intention (""so tempted to just go"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, it describes a thought/temptation, not an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is personal and not explicitly unwanted.
    - The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts or a general desire to die by specifying a concrete method (""plummet to the ground"") and a location (""highest floor""). This presence of a specific plan/method moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    - The post describes a current temptation/intention, not a past initiated action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of clear suicidal intent combined with a specific method/plan aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

198,"If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he wont feel that bad if I kill myself. Any thoughts?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post suggests feelings of guilt or a desire to alleviate perceived pain caused to another, leading to the consideration of suicide as a solution. This indicates significant distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The statement is conditional (""If I deeply hurt... he won't feel that bad if I kill myself"") and posed as a question (""Any thoughts?""). This suggests rumination or exploration of the idea rather than an immediate, imminent intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a personal consideration of ""kill myself"" as a potential outcome or solution, linked to a specific scenario. It is not stated as an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""kill myself""), even if conditional.
    *   No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them. Instead, they are seeking ""thoughts"" on the premise.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   Given the lack of imminence and the absence of any specific action or method, there is no indication of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a conditional, future intention or thought process.
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal suicidal thought (""kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's more than general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a specific contemplation of suicide.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. This absence of a concrete ""how"" or ""when"" (beyond the conditional nature) rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out. The conditional nature of the thought does not negate the presence of the suicidal ideation itself.

Trying to work up the nerve. No one has ever stopped. The last time, someone came out of the elevator looked at me and kept walking, got into their car and left. Do hospitals even have security? This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** The post explicitly mentions ""standing on the ledge,"" ""jump,"" and references ""someone took their life the same way."" ""Jump"" is a specific method.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""No one notice,"" ""can never get the nerve,"" ""trying to work up the nerve,"" ""hoping I'll gain the courage,"" ""maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care."" These indicate profound distress, a struggle with suicidal intent, and a cry for help.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The author describes repeatedly going to a specific location (""ledge of a hospital parking garage"") and engaging in actions directly related to the suicidal method (""standing there. Or sit there. Sometimes for an hour. Trying to work up the nerve""). This is a clear method (jumping) and ongoing preparatory/intended action (being at the location, attempting to gain courage to act).
    *   **References to past actions:** ""The last time, someone came out of the elevator looked at me and kept walking..."" describes a past instance of the author being on the ledge. ""6 years ago someone took their life the same way"" refers to another person's suicide, not the author's.
    *   **Imminence:** ""Trying to work up the nerve"" implies a current, ongoing struggle with the intent to act. The repeated nature of these visits suggests a persistent engagement with the method.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The author states, ""I go hoping I'll gain the courage"" to jump. This clearly indicates a desire to die, even if it's conflicted by a desire for intervention (""maybe someone will stop me""). The phrase ""I can't help it"" implies an overwhelming urge to go to the ledge.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   No direct phrase like ""kill myself,"" but the intent to die by jumping is very clear (""trying to work up the nerve to jump,"" ""hoping I'll gain the courage"").
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die, expressed through the repeated action of going to the ledge with the stated purpose of trying to gain courage to jump.
    *   The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions. Instead, they state they ""can't help it"" and ""go hoping I'll gain the courage,"" indicating a desire to act on the thoughts, even if conflicted.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""jump"") and location (""ledge of a hospital parking garage"") are mentioned.
    *   Yes, there are signs of preparation/intended action: repeatedly going to the specific lethal location, standing/sitting there, and actively ""trying to work up the nerve"" to jump. This is more than just a thought; it's an active engagement with the method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes repeated past actions (""The last time,"" ""Sometimes for an hour"") of being on the ledge and trying to work up the nerve, implying these are ongoing behaviors that could recur. The phrase ""I go hoping I'll gain the courage"" indicates a current/future intention to continue this behavior.
    *   The author states, ""I can never get the nerve to jump."" This means a potentially lethal action (jumping) has *not* been initiated by the author. Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'. However, the actions described (going to the ledge, standing there, trying to work up the nerve) are direct engagements with the method and constitute preparatory/intended actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""hoping I'll gain the courage"" to jump) and is not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation because it describes a specific method (""jump"") and concrete, repeated actions directly related to carrying out that method (going to the specific lethal location, standing there, actively trying to work up the nerve). This constitutes a plan/method/intended action. This rules out 'Ideation'.
    *   The author explicitly states, ""I can never get the nerve to jump,"" confirming that a potentially lethal action has not been *initiated* by them. Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal intent, a specific method, and ongoing preparatory actions (repeatedly going to the ledge, trying to gain courage to jump) fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The author is actively engaging with the means and location for suicide, even if they haven't completed the final act.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless."" It also states, ""I have multiple attempts on my life."" The author mentions ""my death seems to ultimate answer"" and ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""struggling with depression,"" ""life is going absolutely shitty,"" ""hated myself,"" ""grades went to shit,"" ""mentally exhausting,"" ""my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and feeling like a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** For past actions, a method is mentioned (""phone charger since I couldn't find rope""). For current intent, the author states ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident."" This act of searching for methods is a form of preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** Clear references to past initiated suicidal actions: ""The first time I tried committing suicide"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life.""
    *   **Imminence:** ""It gets harder everyday,"" ""recently I was arrested,"" ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself."" This indicates current and ongoing distress and active engagement in seeking methods.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""my death seems to ultimate answer"" clearly expresses a desire for death. ""began searching about ways to kill myself"" indicates a desire to act on these thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""tried committing suicide"" and ""multiple attempts on my life.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end (""my death seems to ultimate answer"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   For past actions, a method is mentioned (""phone charger since I couldn't find rope"").
    *   For current intent, ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself"" is a clear indication of preparation/research for a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes *past initiated actions*: ""The first time I tried committing suicide"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life."" These are concrete, potentially lethal actions initiated by the author.
    *   It also describes current ideation (""my death seems to ultimate answer"") and current preparatory behavior (""recently began searching about ways to kill myself"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (""tried committing suicide,"" ""multiple attempts on my life"").
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" The author brings up these past attempts in the context of their current struggles and feelings.
    *   Although there is also current ideation and preparatory behavior (searching for methods), the rule states that 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Attempt'.

Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""more dead inside"" is present, which is an idiom for emotional numbness or despair, not a literal desire for death. No other mentions of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't understand why nobody cares about me at all,"" ""more dead inside,"" ""Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything."" These indicate deep emotional pain, feelings of betrayal, hopelessness, exhaustion, and a sense of being uncared for.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** None related to suicide/self-harm.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""Im done with everything"" expresses a strong desire for the current situation/struggle to end, but it lacks specific suicidal imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses profound emotional distress and exhaustion with their circumstances (""Im done with everything""). While this is a strong statement of despair, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or for life to end in a literal sense. The focus is on being ""done"" with the emotional struggle and being ""played with.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. ""More dead inside"" is metaphorical. ""Im done with everything"" expresses exhaustion and despair, but not a clear, literal desire for life to end. It's about being done with the *situation* or *struggle*. There is no direct statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't here.""
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or implied.
    *   No signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a general state of being ""done"" with emotional struggles. It does not describe any past, current, or future specific lethal actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed and ""done"" with a painful situation. This aligns with general indicators of mental health struggles.
    *   However, it *lacks* any explicit personal expression of suicidal intent or a clear desire to die. The phrase ""more dead inside"" is a common idiom for emotional numbness, not a literal death wish. ""Im done with everything"" expresses profound despair and exhaustion with life's challenges, but it does not explicitly translate to a desire for suicide or death.
    *   There are no mentions of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted), no plans, no methods, and no past attempts.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (which requires explicit personal suicidal thoughts or desire to die), 'Behavior' (which requires a plan/method/intended action), or 'Attempt' (which requires a past initiated action).
    *   It best fits 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or explicit suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post clearly implies a suicidal act through ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""less scary,"" ""getting more courage"" suggest a progression towards overcoming fear related to a harmful act, indicating a desire to act on suicidal thoughts.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        - Method: ""jump off,"" ""jump out of my bedroom window.""
        - Location: ""my bedroom window.""
        - Details: ""some trees and mud below"" shows contemplation of the act and its potential outcome.
        - Preparation: ""getting more courage"" indicates mental preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicates high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a clear desire to perform the act (""Hopefully I can do it soon"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but the context of ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window"" with ""hopefully I can do it soon"" is a very strong implicit expression of suicidal intent and desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the desire to ""jump off"" and ""do it soon"" implies a desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the writer is actively seeking to gain ""courage"" to perform the act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes.
        - Method: ""jump off.""
        - Location/Means: ""my bedroom window.""
        - Details: ""some trees and mud below"" further specifies the context of the intended act.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""getting more courage"" is a form of mental preparation.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Yes, the desire is present, imminence is high (""soon""), and the method/location is specific enough (""jump out of my bedroom window"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention and future plan (""Hopefully I can do it soon"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, this is a future-oriented statement of intent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator': There is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to act, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - Not 'Ideation': While there is ideation, the post goes beyond mere thoughts by specifying a method (""jump off,"" ""jump out of my bedroom window""), a location, and indicating preparation (""getting more courage"") and high imminence (""soon""). This moves it into the 'Behavior' category.
    - Not 'Attempt': The post describes a future intention, not a past initiated action.
    - This fits 'Behavior' because it expresses suicidal intent and desire to die, along with a specific plan (method and location), and indications of preparation and imminence.

When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""writing suicide notes.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""low energy,"" ""depression hits really hard,"" ""hate talking about myself,"" feeling like they'd ""waste their time,"" feeling misunderstood/accused by their mother. These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and potential anhedonia or social anxiety.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""writing suicide notes"" is a direct mention of a preparation for suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes."" This indicates a recurring pattern of this specific preparation, not a one-time event from the distant past. It's presented as a current/recurrent consequence of their depression.
    *   **Imminence:** The phrase ""next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" implies that this is a current, recurring, and almost automatic response to severe depression, suggesting ongoing risk.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** While the post doesn't explicitly say ""I want to die,"" the act of ""writing suicide notes"" is a strong behavioral indicator of suicidal intent and desire to end one's life. One writes suicide notes as a preparation for suicide, implying a desire to carry out the act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide notes.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While not explicitly stated as ""I want to die,"" the act of writing suicide notes is a direct preparation for suicide, which inherently implies a desire or intent to end one's life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer describes the act of writing notes as something that happens when depression hits hard, not as something they are fighting against or don't want to do.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"" is a clear and explicit sign of preparation.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The act of writing notes is a preparation for action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" indicates a recurring pattern that happens currently or recently when depression is severe. It's not a single, isolated historical event.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. Writing a note is a *preparation* for a suicidal act, not the act itself (an attempt). An attempt would be taking pills, cutting, jumping, etc., that was initiated.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The mention of ""writing suicide notes"" goes far beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. It's a concrete preparatory action.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there's strong implied ideation, the presence of ""writing suicide notes"" moves it beyond mere thoughts/desire into the realm of preparation. Ideation is defined as *without* any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent (implied by writing notes) and explicitly mentions a preparation being taken (""writing suicide notes""). The recurring nature (""sometimes... next thing I know"") suggests this is an ongoing behavioral pattern.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The post describes writing notes (a preparation), not a past or very recent *initiated lethal action* (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself"").

Based on the analysis, the mention of ""writing suicide notes"" clearly indicates a preparatory action associated with suicidal intent, placing it in the 'Behavior' category.

    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""hope i die"" is a very clear and explicit expression of a desire for death.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""hope i die"" directly expresses a desire for life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire ""hope i die"" is stated as a personal wish, not as an unwanted thought. The ""ruse for attention"" line is more self-deprecating than a negation of the desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   No vague reference to action implying a method or plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire (""hope i die"").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""hope i die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator', as 'Indicator' is for general distress or *unwanted* suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""I hate living"" is explicitly stated as Ideation, and ""hope i die"" falls into the same category of expressing a desire for life to end.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   Based on the explicit personal expression of a desire for death (""hope i die"") without any mention of a plan, method, or action, the post best fits 'Ideation'.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Key elements: ""cut"" directly refers to self-harm. ""to deep"" indicates the severity or depth of the cut. ""Ah. Just... fuck"" conveys distress, possibly regret or shock at the severity.
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""cut"" is a method of self-harm. The phrase ""to deep"" suggests the action was severe and potentially beyond mere superficial injury, implying a potentially lethal or very serious self-harm act.
    *   Emotional indicators: Distress, pain, possibly a sense of having gone too far.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cut"" is a method. The phrasing ""Just cut to deep"" indicates an action has already occurred or is very recently completed/ongoing.
    *   References to past actions: ""Just cut"" implies a very recent completed action.
    *   Imminence: ""Just"" signifies immediate past or ongoing.
    *   Writer's stated desire: Not explicitly stated as a desire to die, but the action described is a severe act of self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Not explicitly stated, but the action of cutting ""to deep"" implies a serious, potentially life-threatening act of self-harm.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? N/A, as an action is described.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? ""cut"" is a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation, but the action itself is described.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die...: While explicit desire to die isn't stated, a severe self-harm action is described. The severity (""to deep"") suggests a potentially lethal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a very recent, initiated action: ""Just cut"".
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes. ""Just cut to deep"" describes a self-initiated action. The phrase ""to deep"" implies a severity that could be potentially lethal, or a serious self-harm act that went further than intended, making it a potentially life-threatening action. This fits the criteria for an 'Attempt' where a concrete, potentially life-threatening action by the author must have been *initiated*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'Indicator': No, this is not general distress or unwanted thoughts. An action is described.
    *   'Ideation': No, this is beyond thoughts or desire. A specific action has occurred.
    *   'Behavior': Behavior describes a *plan, method, or intended action* that has not yet been initiated. The phrasing ""Just cut to deep"" indicates an *initiated* action, not just a plan or intention. If it said ""I'm going to cut myself deep,"" it would be Behavior.
    *   'Attempt': The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The phrase ""Just cut to deep"" describes a very recent, self-initiated action (""cut"") that is described with a level of severity (""to deep"") implying it was potentially lethal or a very serious self-harm act. This directly aligns with the 'Attempt' definition. Even if the intent wasn't explicitly to die, the action described is a serious, potentially life-threatening act of self-harm that has been initiated.

You're an attention hungry piece of shit that feeds off the misery of others",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post does not contain explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm by the author. It quotes others saying ""don't do it!"", which implies a context of suicide or self-harm, but this is attributed to others, not the author's own intent or thoughts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author expresses strong negative emotions: anger, frustration, contempt, and disgust towards others. Phrases like ""tired of all the people having the AUDACITY,"" ""random fucking bullshit crap,"" ""OH MY FUCKING GOD YOU ARE SO HILARIOUS AND PATHETIC,"" ""attention hungry piece of shit that feeds off the misery of others"" clearly indicate intense negative affect directed outwards. The phrase ""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice lmao"" suggests internal distress or a struggle that is not chosen, but it does not specify what that feeling is (e.g., suicidal thoughts, depression, general misery).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None are mentioned by the author.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No intentions are stated by the author.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer's stated desire is to criticize and express anger towards people who offer unsolicited advice in what appears to be a sensitive online space. There is no explicit desire to die or for life to end expressed by the author.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not from the author's perspective. The quoted phrase ""don't do it!"" implies a suicidal context, but the author is *criticizing* those who say it, not expressing their own intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The author expresses anger and frustration, and implies an internal struggle (""what I'm feeling is something I do by choice""), but does not state a desire to die or end their life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned by the author as their own.
    *   There is no clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or signs of preparation are mentioned or implied by the author.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings of anger and frustration. It does not describe any past, current, or future potentially lethal actions initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is an angry rant directed at others providing unwanted advice in a context that is implied to be about suicide (given the ""don't do it!"" quote).
    *   While the *context* of the discussion might be suicide, the author's *own words* do not express personal suicidal intent, a desire to die, a plan, or a past attempt.
    *   The phrase ""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice lmao"" indicates internal distress or a difficult experience, but it is too vague to be classified as suicidal ideation. It could refer to depression, anxiety, or any other mental health struggle.
    *   The post lacks the explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to die required for 'Ideation'.
    *   It lacks any mention of a plan, method, or intended action for 'Behavior'.
    *   It lacks any description of a past initiated action for 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it best fits 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and is situated within a context related to suicide, but without the author explicitly stating personal suicidal intent or a desire to die.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""i kinda just wanna die""
    - Emotional indicators: ""i dont really know what i want"", ""struggle to get up"", ""find everything boring"", ""friends are the only thing keeping me going and i dont have many since they all left"", ""i get bullied so stopped attending school"", ""i dont have good grades"", ""idk what i should do haha"" - indicates significant distress, anhedonia, hopelessness, social isolation, and academic struggles.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""friends all left"", ""stopped attending school"" - these are past life events, not past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: The statement ""kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time"" indicates a conflicted thought, not high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire to die (""kinda just wanna die"") but immediately qualifies it with ""but dont at the same time if you get me"". This suggests the thought is present but not a clear, personal, and resolved desire to act on it; rather, it's a conflicted or unwanted thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? It expresses ""kinda just wanna die"" but immediately negates/conflicts this with ""but dont at the same time"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""but dont at the same time"" indicates a resistance or an unwanted aspect to the desire to die. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die"".

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned.
    - No signs of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Describes current feelings and struggles. No past initiated suicidal actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and anhedonia, which are general indicators of mental health struggles.
    - The phrase ""i kinda just wanna die"" suggests suicidal ideation. However, the crucial qualifier ""but dont at the same time if you get me"" indicates that this desire to die is not a firm, personal intent, but rather a conflicted or unwanted thought. This directly matches the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die"".
    - There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - While the post contains suicidal thoughts, the explicit negation/conflict (""but dont at the same time"") prevents it from being classified as 'Ideation' (which requires a clear, personal expression of desire to die). Instead, it falls under the 'Indicator' category due to the unwanted nature of the suicidal thought.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""want to justify dying,"" ""thinking about partially planning to die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""guilty,"" ""anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse,"" ""fear I only hurt,"" ""feel terrible,"" ""terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""partially planning to die"" is a direct indication of a plan, even if incomplete or vague. The statement ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips"" acknowledges methods exist but implies a lack of *easy* access to *strong* ones, not an absence of methods entirely.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past initiated actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** Thoughts have ""increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months,"" ""every single day I feel terrible."" The desire to warn a friend ""if I keep getting worse he has to know"" suggests a perceived risk of future action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die (""want to justify dying,"" ""thinking about partially planning to die"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicit.
    *   Yes, ""want to justify dying"" and ""thinking about partially planning to die"" clearly express a desire for life to end.
    *   The thoughts are not stated as unwanted; rather, they are being ""partially planned.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, or location is detailed.
    *   However, the phrase ""partially planning to die"" directly indicates a planning element. This moves beyond mere ideation into the realm of active consideration of *how* to die, even if the specifics are not fully formed or disclosed. This is the key element for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current and ongoing suicidal thoughts and a current/future intention (""partially planning to die"").
    *   No past *initiated* actions are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear, personal suicidal intent (""want to justify dying,"" ""suicidal thoughts"" that are being acted upon via ""planning"").
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past self-initiated potentially lethal action is described.
    *   The crucial distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is thoughts/desire without a plan/method/intended action. 'Behavior' includes a plan, method, intended action, or preparations. The phrase ""partially planning to die"" explicitly states a planning component. While the plan is not fully detailed, the *act of planning* (even if partial) elevates it from mere ideation to behavior. The user is not just thinking about dying, but actively engaging in the process of planning it.

    *   **References to past actions:** ""ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears."" This explicitly states they were *too scared to end it*, meaning no past initiated action occurred.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""now i really don't care any more"" (about previous fears of ending it). ""I've been thinking i could just drive out..."" indicates active planning for a future action.

    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states ""now i really don't care any more"" about previous fears, indicating a removal of restraint.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes. The method is ""hang myself."" The location is ""mountains,"" ""nice little spot."" The plan involves ""drive out"" and ""hike.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The detailed description of *how* they would carry out the act (""drive out,"" ""hike,"" ""find a spot,"" ""hang myself"") constitutes a specific plan for action, which falls under the 'Behavior' definition.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a clear *future intention* with a specific plan (""I've been thinking i could just drive out..."").

    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire to die/not live anymore. It is not expressed as unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts."" No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't know what to do anymore,"" ""it's just not working,"" ""so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on,"" ""I'm just tired of all of it."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. The post details efforts to cope and improve, but no plans for self-harm.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned. The phrase ""it's been years"" refers to the duration of the suicidal thoughts, not a past attempt.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The thoughts are described as constant (""Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts""). There is no specific immediate plan for action, but the ideation is pervasive.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer states ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal."" This indicates a genuine, personal experience of suicidal ideation. They are not expressing that these thoughts are unwanted in the sense of ""my brain says X but I don't want to do it,"" but rather expressing profound distress and exhaustion *from* having these constant suicidal thoughts despite trying everything to get better. This implies a desire for the thoughts/feelings/suffering to end, which is characteristic of ideation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""unbelievably suicidal,"" ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the profound despair, exhaustion (""I'm just tired of all of it""), and constant suicidal thoughts strongly imply a desire for the current state of suffering, and potentially life itself, to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses deep frustration and hopelessness *because* they are experiencing these thoughts constantly and cannot overcome them, despite trying many coping mechanisms. They are not disavowing the thoughts as unwanted intrusions but rather expressing their ongoing presence as a core problem.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, ongoing state of intense suicidal ideation.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal, current, and pervasive suicidal thoughts and feelings (""unbelievably suicidal,"" ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts""). This meets the criteria for 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not merely express general distress or abstractly discuss suicide; the author explicitly states their own suicidal state. The thoughts are not presented as explicitly unwanted in the sense of a cognitive distortion they are fighting against but rather as a pervasive reality they are exhausted by. Therefore, 'Indicator' is not appropriate.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations being taken. Therefore, 'Behavior' is not appropriate.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not appropriate.
    *   The post perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""fucked up self,"" ""depression and anxiety,"" ""scared they'll just think it's an excuse for me to be lazy,"" ""literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore,"" ""idk what to do."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being stuck.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: Not applicable, as no suicidal intentions are stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""I need therapy more than anything else"" and ""the only way I can fix my fucked up self is therapy."" The desire is to get help and improve, not to end life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The desire is to get help and fix their problems.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No suicidal thoughts are mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current struggle (""I need therapy,"" ""I can't tell them,"" ""I literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore"") and a desire for future help.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness (""fucked up self,"" ""depression and anxiety,"" ""no motivation to get up"").
    - It explicitly lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. In fact, the author expresses a desire to ""fix"" themselves through therapy.
    - There are no mentions of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted), plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
    - This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""new suicide method"" (referring to eye drops in beverages, adapted from a murder method).
    - Emotional indicators: ""sigh,"" ""i wish i wasn't like this :("" indicating distress and self-disappointment.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions getting ""ideas"" for a ""new suicide method,"" but it's presented as an unwanted thought rather than a concrete plan or preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: No imminence stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: This is crucial. The writer explicitly states, ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that."" This clearly indicates that the suicidal thoughts and ideas are *unwanted* and do not represent a genuine personal desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""new suicide method.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The writer explicitly negates this desire: ""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that."" This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? A method (""eye drops in beverages"") is mentioned as an ""idea"" for a ""new suicide method."" However, this is in the context of *unwanted* thoughts, not a desired plan. There are no signs of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current unwanted thoughts and ideas.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains ""suicidal thoughts"" and even identifies a ""method idea."" However, the defining characteristic is the explicit statement that these thoughts are *unwanted* and that the author ""really don't want to have to do that.""
    - The 'Indicator' definition specifically covers this: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die').""
    - Despite the mention of a ""new suicide method,"" it's presented as an intrusive thought that the author is trying to suppress, not a desired plan. The primary sentiment is distress *about having* these thoughts, not a desire to act on them. This clearly fits the 'Indicator' category.

Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc.

Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""suicide note,"" ""free myself of my problems,"" ""blocking my own shot,"" ""do it this time.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm the common denominator in all of my problems"" (self-blame, despair), ""felt so calm then"" (associated with suicidal planning), ""coax the feeling back out"" (desire to return to that state), ""rush of calm.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""A month ago I wrote a suicide note,"" ""primed and ready to be posted on social media,"" ""Planned everything out,"" ""Picked a time and place.""
    *   **References to past actions:** The author describes a past event (""A month ago"") where they ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""Planned everything out,"" and ""Picked a time and place."" They then state, ""Then sabotaged myself."" This indicates that the *preparations and planning* were completed, but the *actual lethal action was not initiated* by the author; it was self-interrupted *before* initiation.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" indicates a current, future intention to act on a similar plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die/end problems through suicide, and a current desire to ""do it this time.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""suicide note"" and ""do it this time"" (in context of suicide) explicitly state intent.
    *   Yes, a clear desire to end life is expressed.
    *   No negation; rather, a desire to re-experience the calm and potentially act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific plan and preparations are mentioned: ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""primed and ready to be posted,"" ""Planned everything out,"" ""Picked a time and place."" These are explicit behavioral elements.
    *   The phrase ""Then sabotaged myself"" is crucial. It means the *lethal action itself* was not initiated, but the *planning and preparation* were.
    *   The current statement ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" implies a current intention to carry out such a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past event (""A month ago"") where extensive planning and preparation were done, but the *lethal action was not initiated* (""sabotaged myself""). This is a past *behavioral* step (planning/preparation), not a past *attempt* (initiated action).
    *   It also describes a current/future intention: ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time,"" indicating a current desire to act on a plan.
    *   Since the past event explicitly states the action was *not* initiated (""sabotaged myself""), it does not meet the definition of 'Attempt' (which requires an *initiated action*).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and desire, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts/feelings by detailing specific preparations and planning (""wrote a suicide note,"" ""Planned everything out,"" ""Picked a time and place""). This rules out 'Ideation'.
    *   The key distinction is between 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'. An 'Attempt' requires an *initiated potentially lethal action*. The post explicitly states ""Then sabotaged myself,"" meaning the action was *not initiated*. Therefore, it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   The detailed past planning and preparation, combined with the current stated intention to ""do it this time,"" perfectly fit the definition of 'Behavior': ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations being taken."" The past event was a clear instance of behavioral preparation, and the current statement indicates a present intention to engage in similar behavior.

215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay. I am hanging on by threads at this moment. trying to find things in the world to enjoy like I did when i was much younger. As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" strongly implies a contemplation of non-existence or death. No direct mentions of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""suffering,"" ""don't feel it will ever end,"" ""utter hell,"" ""alone and forgotten,"" ""stain upon the world,"" ""crying,"" ""forsaken,"" ""pain,"" ""tension,"" ""rotten pit,"" ""outcast,"" ""hanging on by threads,"" ""endless pain,"" ""fading memory."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and a profound sense of being a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""hanging on by threads at this moment"" indicates a current, precarious state. ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present"" indicates a current struggle to find reasons to live, implying a desire to end it if those reasons aren't found.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The statement ""i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" expresses a profound sense of worthlessness and implies a desire for their existence to cease, as it would make no difference. This is a strong proxy for a desire for life to end, even if not explicitly ""I want to die.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes. The phrase ""i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" in the context of extreme suffering, feeling like a ""stain upon the world,"" and being ""hanging on by threads"" strongly conveys a desire for life to end or for non-existence. This fits the definition of ""profound expressions of wanting life to end.""
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the thoughts/feelings are not negated. The writer states a *reason to stay* (""try to find worth in the present""), but this is a struggle against the overwhelming pain and the implied desire for things to end, rather than a negation of the desire itself.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a high imminence and vague reference to action? No specific action is mentioned, only the general feeling of being ""hanging on by threads.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current, ongoing state of severe distress and a fragile hold on life.
    *   No past or current specific, potentially lethal actions are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains profound expressions of despair, hopelessness, and worthlessness, culminating in the statement ""i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" and ""I am hanging on by threads."" These phrases, especially in context, indicate a clear personal desire for life to end or for non-existence due to unbearable suffering. This goes beyond general distress and aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""profound expressions of wanting life to end,"" ""I wish I could disappear"").
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or intended action, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because the expressions (""world would not change if I were gone,"" ""hanging on by threads"") are not abstract or explicitly unwanted thoughts; they represent a personal, profound desire for the suffering to end, implying an end to life.

Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""want to die"", ""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself"". These are direct mentions of suicidal intent and specific methods of self-harm/suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm done with life"", ""all I cause is pain"". These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, and self-blame.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, a clear plan is stated: ""So Tuesday, I'm either going to slit my wrist and get into my broken car or hang myself from a tree for my parents to see."" This includes a specific day (""Tuesday""), two distinct methods (""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself from a tree""), and associated locations/circumstances (""get into my broken car,"" ""for my parents to see"").
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""So Tuesday"" indicates a specific, near-future intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""make me want to die"", ""I'm done with life"". This is a clear and strong desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""want to die"" and ""I'm done with life"" are direct expressions of a desire for life to end.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, unequivocally (""make me want to die,"" ""I'm done with life"").
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present and intended.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes. Methods: ""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself from a tree."" Locations: ""broken car,"" ""tree.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The detailed plan for a specific day (""Tuesday"") and the choice of methods/locations indicate a firm intention to act, which aligns with 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""So Tuesday, I'm either going to..."").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses clear personal suicidal intent (""want to die,"" ""I'm done with life""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by outlining a specific plan, including methods (""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself from a tree"") and a timeframe (""Tuesday""). This presence of a plan/method/intended action elevates it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   The post describes an *intended future action*, not a *past initiated action*. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post perfectly fits the definition of 'Behavior': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a plan to commit suicide, specific methods, and an intended action.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts."" Expresses a clear desire: ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please,"" ""suicide would be better."" Mentions ""suicide is selfish."" No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""empty,"" ""struggle,"" ""stressing,"" ""not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts."" Despite external successes, the writer feels a profound lack of purpose.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquiring means are described.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions a past robbery attempt, but this is not a self-initiated suicidal action. No past suicide attempts are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is given for any action. The thoughts are current, and the desire is strong, but there's no indication of immediate intent to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and strong personal desire for death and for life to end (""better if I was dead,"" ""Sign me up please,"" ""suicide would be better""). The writer does *not* state these thoughts are unwanted in the sense of not wanting to die; rather, they are grappling with the *existence* of these thoughts despite external factors, and the only thing stopping them is the perceived impact on others.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""suicide.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/not be alive: ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please,"" ""suicide would be better.""
    *   The writer does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. While they question *why* they have them given their life circumstances, the desire itself is clearly expressed as a personal preference.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied for a suicidal act.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no high imminence combined with a vague reference to action. The post is focused on the internal struggle, desire for death, and the reasons *not* to act (impact on others).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current suicidal thoughts and a current desire for death. It hypothesizes future scenarios (""next morning I'm dead?""), but these are not stated as definite plans or intentions.
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire for life to end (""better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please,"" ""suicide would be better""). This rules out 'Indicator', as it goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. The writer is contemplating the *idea* of suicide and the reasons *not* to act, rather than detailing *how* they would act.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated potentially lethal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' due to the explicit personal suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without any accompanying plan, method, or preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""10x more suicidal."" It mentions calling a hotline and being ""stuck in a psych ward for 3 days."" The user clarifies that *last time* they called, they ""didn't have a method or anything.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""worried,"" ""paranoid,"" ""irrational,"" ""10x more suicidal.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned for the present or future. The user explicitly denies having a method or plan during the previous incident.
    *   **References to past actions:** The user describes a past event where they called a hotline, police were called, and they were hospitalized. This was *not* a suicidal action, but a consequence of seeking help. They explicitly state ""didn't have a method or anything"" at that time.
    *   **Imminence:** The user is currently seeking information about hotlines, indicating a present need for support due to feeling ""10x more suicidal."" There's no imminence of a suicidal *act* mentioned, but rather imminence of seeking help.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer states they were made ""10x more suicidal"" by the previous experience and are now seeking a hotline where they can talk without intervention. This indicates current suicidal ideation and a desire for support for those feelings.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""10x more suicidal.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? The phrase ""10x more suicidal"" indicates a clear personal experience of increased suicidal thoughts/feelings. It implies a desire for life to end or not to be alive, or at least a strong presence of such thoughts.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the user expresses being *more* suicidal, which implies these thoughts are present and distressing, leading them to seek a hotline. They are not explicitly stating they *do not* want these thoughts, but rather are seeking a safe way to address them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The user explicitly stated ""didn't have a method or anything"" in the past, and no current method is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. There is no reference to an *action* or *plan* in the current context, only a desire to find a safe hotline.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. It describes a past negative experience when seeking help, and a current intention to seek help again under different conditions.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The past event was calling a hotline, not a suicidal action. The user explicitly stated they ""didn't have a method or anything"" at that time. Therefore, no past suicidal attempt is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly indicates current suicidal thoughts/feelings (""10x more suicidal"") which goes beyond general distress and signifies a personal expression of suicidal ideation. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for suicide in the current or future context. The user's focus is on finding a safe way to talk about their feelings, not on executing a plan. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   The post describes a past event of seeking help and its negative consequences, but it does *not* describe a past self-initiated potentially lethal action. The user explicitly states they ""didn't have a method or anything"" last time. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The presence of explicit personal suicidal thoughts (""10x more suicidal"") without any plan or action fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

219,This is not right. I dont want to live anymore. I just want be by myself.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""I don't want to live anymore"" is a direct expression of a desire for life to end.
    - Emotional indicators: ""This is not right"" indicates distress. ""I don't want to live anymore"" indicates hopelessness and a desire for life to end. ""I just want to be by myself"" indicates withdrawal/isolation.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""), but the desire is current.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, genuine wish for life to end (""I don't want to live anymore""). It is not expressed as an unwanted thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I don't want to live anymore"" expresses a clear desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a personal feeling, not an unwanted thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Is there a vague reference to action implying a method/plan with high imminence? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of desire.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear personal expression of a desire for life to end (""I don't want to live anymore""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts, but a direct desire.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer, without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

220,'If you are actually suicidal and not been attention seeking you would've told no one and just ended it silently so nobody could stop you' FUCK OFF.

AND YOU SAYING THAT DOESNT HELP AT ALL AND MAKES ME HATE YOU BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL IF YOU SAY THAT. Everything I do that has something to do with my feelings I get called out for 'attention seeking.'. They don't care. They won't believe it until I die. Then they'll say 'oh why didn't he ask for help' BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT YOU SICK PIECE OF GARBAGE. Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post uses the word ""suicidal"" when quoting someone else's dismissive comment. It also uses phrases like ""just ended it silently so nobody could stop you"" and ""until I die,"" both in the context of the author's own struggle and being misunderstood.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme rage, anger, frustration, feeling misunderstood, neglected, and dismissed (""FUCK OFF,"" ""I FUCKING HATE IT,"" ""rage,"" ""angrily,"" ""sick piece of garbage""). The phrase ""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT"" indicates a profound internal struggle against giving up or acting on suicidal impulses. ""I still need help"" also points to ongoing distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT"" refers to past attempts to seek help, not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No direct stated intention to act, but the current struggle to ""hold on"" implies ongoing suicidal thoughts or urges. ""They won't believe it until I die"" suggests a belief that their death is a possible outcome of their current state.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer is expressing profound frustration because their genuine feelings, which include suicidal thoughts/urges, are being dismissed as ""attention seeking."" The core of their anger is that they *are* suicidal or struggling with suicidal urges (""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT"") and are trying to get help, but are being invalidated. This clearly indicates the presence of personal suicidal ideation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal"" (in a quote they are refuting) and ""ended it silently"" (referring to suicide). ""until I die"" is also present.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the phrase ""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT"" strongly implies that the writer is actively battling a desire to give up or end their life. Their anger stems from people dismissing their *actual* suicidal feelings. ""They won't believe it until I die"" further reinforces the presence of personal suicidal ideation.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The phrase ""IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT"" suggests a desire *not* to act on them, but it doesn't negate the presence of the thoughts themselves. It signifies a struggle *against* suicidal impulses, confirming the presence of ideation. This is not an ""unwanted thought"" scenario where the thought is alien to the person's desire; it's a personal struggle with a desire they are fighting.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current struggle (""I'm trying to hold on,"" ""I still need help"") and past experiences of being dismissed (""I did [ask for help] and you neglected it"").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The ""BC I DID"" refers to asking for help, not a suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly indicates that the author is experiencing personal suicidal thoughts or urges (""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT,"" ""They won't believe it until I die""). The anger is directed at people who dismiss these genuine feelings as ""attention seeking."" This goes beyond general distress; it's distress *about* being suicidal and not being believed.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    *   There is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category as it describes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings or a desire for life to end, without a specific plan or action. The struggle to ""hold on"" confirms the presence of these thoughts, even if the author is fighting them.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I feel like killing myself every day"", ""suicide note"", ""this might be my final good bye"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""so lonely"", ""so fucking tired"", ""no more strength"", ""it hurts so much"", ""sad to say this"". Indicates hopelessness, despair, emotional exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"". This explicitly states preparations for suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer"". This refers to past engagement with the platform or life in general, not a past suicide attempt.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""Everythings ready"", ""this might be my final good bye"" suggests high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die/end life (""killing myself"", ""final good bye""). Not expressing unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself"", ""suicide note"".
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I feel like killing myself every day"", ""this might be my final good bye"".
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present and acted upon through preparations.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific *method* is named (e.g., pills, gun, jump).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, absolutely. ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done."" This is a clear and explicit mention of preparations.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While no specific method is mentioned, the explicit preparations (""suicide note,"" ""bills,"" ""testament"") combined with ""Everythings ready"" and ""final good bye"" clearly indicate an intended action and a plan to carry it out.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state with high imminence for future action (""Everythings ready"", ""final good bye"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The mention of ""ive wrote here before"" refers to past engagement with the platform, not a past suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I feel like killing myself every day"", ""final good bye""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post goes beyond mere thoughts/desire by explicitly mentioning preparations: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done."" These are concrete steps taken towards a suicidal act. This clearly fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

The presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with concrete preparations (suicide note, bills, testament) classifies this as 'Behavior'.

I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting. I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog. I haven't talked to anyone in a long while and everyone thinks i'm ok. I'm not though. I don't know what to do anymore. I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""i'm going to kms"" multiple times, including ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon,"" and ""I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon."" It also mentions ""I can't stop cutting,"" which is self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""holding it all in and i'm about to explode,"" ""can't keep it to myself anymore,"" ""I'm not ok,"" ""don't know what to do anymore."" These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jump) is mentioned for the suicidal act. No preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""Cutting"" is a current behavior, but not explicitly stated as the *method* for the stated imminent suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I can't stop cutting"" indicates ongoing self-harm behavior. No past *suicide attempts* are described.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** High imminence is stated: ""about to explode,"" ""going to kms very soon,"" ""about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog,"" ""kms soon.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, explicit, and accepted desire to die by suicide (""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon""). This is not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kms"" and ""kill myself"" as a personal intention.
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die/end life, stated as an accepted fact and imminent intention.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they state acceptance of the intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, or location for the suicide is mentioned.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   However, the post states a clear *intended action* with high imminence: ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"" and ""I'm about to kms."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence)."" The action is ""kms,"" and the imminence is ""very soon"" / ""about to."" This fits the criteria for Behavior. The cutting is a self-harm behavior, but the direct statements of ""kms very soon"" are the primary drivers here for classification.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current distress and clear future intentions (""going to kms very soon,"" ""kms soon"").
    *   It does not describe a past *initiated, potentially lethal suicidal action* by the author. ""I can't stop cutting"" describes ongoing self-harm, which is a behavior, but not a past suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent and a desire to die (""I'm going to kms,"" ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is suicidal thoughts/desire without a plan/method/intended action. 'Behavior' includes suicidal thoughts/desire *with* a plan, method, or *intended action*.
    *   The statements ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon"" and ""I'm about to kms"" are clear statements of an *intended action* with high imminence. Although a specific method is not detailed, the definition of 'Behavior' explicitly allows for an ""intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence)."" This post strongly fits this criterion.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself even more,"" refers to ""suicide notes,"" and ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" (specific method). Also mentions ""burden of my death.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Anger, resentment (""ruin their lives,"" ""they deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death""), hopelessness (""I don't care""), distress, feeling misunderstood.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""suicide notes I threw away"" indicates past preparation. ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" indicates a specific method (""shoot myself"") and high imminence (""on the spot"").
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Family found out that I wanna kill myself"" (past expression of intent), ""found one of my suicide notes I threw away"" (past preparatory action by the author).
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""killing myself even more"" indicates increased current desire. ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" implies immediate desire for action using a specific method.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die and kill themselves, explicitly stated and intensified. No negation of suicidal thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself,"" ""suicide notes,"" ""if I do it,"" ""my death.""
    *   Yes, clear desire to die.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they state the desire is *even more* intense.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""shoot myself.""
    *   Yes, signs of preparation are mentioned: ""suicide notes I threw away."" While thrown away, it's a past action of preparing for suicide.
    *   The combination of explicit desire (""wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself even more"") and a specific method (""shoot myself"") with high imminence (""on the spot"") strongly points to 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes past events (intervention, finding notes, arguments) and current/future intentions (""wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself even more,"" ""wish I could shoot myself"").
    *   It does *not* describe a past *initiated lethal action* (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). The ""suicide notes"" are a preparation, not an initiated attempt. The ""wish I could shoot myself"" is a desire for an action, not a description of an action already initiated.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to clear, personal, and intensified suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because a specific method (""shoot myself"") and past preparation (""suicide notes"") are mentioned, moving it beyond mere thoughts/desire.
    *   **Behavior:** This is the best fit. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire (""wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself even more"") AND mentions a specific method (""shoot myself"") that the author wishes to use with high imminence (""on the spot""). The mention of ""suicide notes I threw away"" also indicates past preparatory actions, which supports the 'Behavior' classification.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past *initiated lethal action* is described by the author. The notes were preparation, not an attempt. The desire to shoot oneself is a current wish, not a past initiated action.

Therefore, the presence of strong intent, specific method, and past preparation aligns with 'Behavior'.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""can't feel anything right now,"" ""it's all I can think about,"" ""back here"" (implies returning to a state of distress).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, ""OD today,"" ""have a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal,"" ""popping all of them at once."" This is a specific method (overdose) with named substances and an immediate timeframe.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""thinking about suicide for a while now"" indicates persistent ideation, but no past *initiated action* (attempt) is described.
    *   **Imminence:** ""today,"" ""right now."" High imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The intention to ""OD today"" and ""hope for the best"" (implying a desired lethal outcome) clearly indicates a genuine desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""thinking about suicide for a while now.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the clear intention to ""OD today"" and ""hope for the best"" implies a desire for a lethal outcome.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the thoughts are consuming and linked to an immediate plan (""it's all I can think about"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""OD,"" ""venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal,"" ""popping all of them at once."" This is a specific method with named substances.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Having the prescription and stating the immediate intent to take them all constitutes a plan/intended action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""Think I'm going to OD today"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, it only mentions past *thinking* about suicide, not a past *attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes a specific plan/method (overdose with named medications) and a clear intention to act (""Think I'm going to OD today,"" ""popping all of them at once""). This goes beyond mere thoughts or desire, thus ruling out 'Ideation'.
    *   It describes a *future intended action* (today), not a *past initiated action*. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The combination of explicit suicidal intent, a specific method, and high imminence fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""The end is the only thing that feels right now."" This strongly implies an end to life, specifically the author's life, given the context.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I've got nothing left,"" ""completely used up,"" ""Sorry,"" ""I'm sorry I wasn't a better person."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and guilt.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method is mentioned. However, the phrases ""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt and thank you to those who brought any light into my life,"" ""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson,"" and ""I'm sorry I wasn't a better person"" are very strong indicators of a farewell message or suicide note, which constitutes a form of preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""The end is the only thing that feels right *now*."" This indicates a strong, current, and imminent feeling. The farewells also suggest imminence.
    - Stated desire: ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" clearly expresses a desire for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" clearly conveys a desire for life to end, supported by the farewells.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; the ""end"" feels ""right.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No explicit method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes. The apologies, thanks, and direct goodbyes to specific individuals (""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson"") are classic hallmarks of a suicide note or final communication. This is a clear form of preparation, as defined in the 'Behavior' category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state and an imminent intention (""feels right now"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire for life to end (""The end is the only thing that feels right now"") and is not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The presence of farewells, apologies, and thanks to specific individuals strongly indicates preparations being taken (akin to writing a suicide note). This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' (thoughts/desire without a plan/method/action/preparation).
    - The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations being taken"" (e.g., ""writing my suicide note""). The language used in the post functions as a final message or note, which is a preparation for a suicidal act.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the combination of clear intent for life to end and significant preparatory actions (farewell message) places this post in the 'Behavior' category.

My mind is going crazy and all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat. I feel incredibly overwhelmed and don't know what to do. Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I was already suicidal,"" ""cutting my god damn throat.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""feel so bad,"" ""terrible terrible,"" ""mind is going crazy,"" ""incredibly overwhelmed,"" ""can't even cry.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific method.
    - References to past actions: ""I was already suicidal and depressed"" refers to a past state of mind, not a past initiated action.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The desire is strong and current (""all I want to do is..."").
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire to ""shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat,"" indicating a wish for life/thoughts to end via a specific self-harm/suicidal act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I was already suicidal.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" clearly expresses a desire for thoughts/life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific, lethal method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations mentioned.
    - The explicit desire to die/end thoughts (from step 2) is present, and a specific method is mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current, strong desire/intention to act (""all I want to do is...""). ""I was already suicidal"" refers to a past state, but the core of the post is current intent and method.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, it describes a *desire to act* with a specific method in the present/future, not a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is incorrect because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and a specific method, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - 'Ideation' is incorrect because a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat"") is mentioned, which goes beyond mere thoughts or desire without a plan/method.
    - 'Behavior' is the best fit. The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""I was already suicidal,"" ""all I want to do is shut every thought down"") AND also mentions a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat""). This constitutes a plan/method.
    - 'Attempt' is incorrect because the post describes a current desire and method, not a past self-initiated action.

227,"Quote about suicide. I recently stumbled upon this quote that said something along the lines of ""if you want to kill yourself you might as well keep going cause it doenst matter"" much more beautifully phrased thought. Anyone know more about it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" within a quote the user is referring to. The user is asking about a ""quote about suicide.""
    - Emotional indicators: No direct emotional indicators from the user. The user is expressing curiosity about a quote.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None from the user themselves.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No intentions stated by the user.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is asking for information about a quote, not expressing a personal desire to die or suicidal thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, but only within a quote that the user is referencing, not as a personal statement of intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The user's intent is to inquire about a quote.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as the user is not expressing personal suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned or implied by the user.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes the user having ""stumbled upon"" a quote, which is a past event. There is no description of a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post discusses suicide abstractly by referring to a quote. There is no clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author of the post. The user is merely seeking information about a quote related to suicide. This fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it discusses suicide abstractly and lacks personal intent. It does not contain personal ideation, a plan, or a past attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""i want to leave earth,"" ""i always end up wanting to die,"" ""i'm ready to join my dog,"" ""i can't do this anymore."" These are direct expressions of a desire to die or for life to end. ""Join my dog"" is a clear euphemism for dying.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i'm not happy anymore,"" ""never been truly happy,"" ""life so difficult,"" ""give up on everything,"" ""endless loop,"" ""my life will never get better,"" ""i've accepted that."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and a sense of futility.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, or preparatory actions (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means).
    *   **References to past actions:** ""i always end up wanting to die"" refers to a recurring pattern of ideation, not a past *initiated suicidal action*.
    *   **Imminence:** ""now i'm ready to join my dog"" indicates a current state of readiness or acceptance of dying. While not a specific time like ""tonight,"" it suggests a present and strong desire.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire to die and for life to end. The writer states ""i've accepted that and now i'm ready."" This is not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly using those exact words.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, strongly. ""i want to leave earth,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""ready to join my dog,"" ""i can't do this anymore.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true (""i've accepted that and now i'm ready"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. While imminence is high (""now i'm ready""), there is *no* reference to an action or method, even vague. ""Join my dog"" describes the desired outcome (death), not the means to achieve it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current readiness/intention (""now i'm ready"") and a recurring past pattern of ideation (""i always end up wanting to die"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The phrase ""i always end up wanting to die"" describes a recurring thought pattern, not a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts (""i want to leave earth,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""ready to join my dog""). This rules out 'Indicator', as it's not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   The post lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. While the desire and readiness are strong, the *how* is missing. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. The definition of Behavior requires a plan, method, intended action, or preparations.
    *   There is no description of a past *initiated* suicidal action. The recurring ""wanting to die"" is ideation, not an attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive, or profound expressions of wanting life to end, but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/suicide/self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" It also mentions ""his passing has saved my life for the time being.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author expresses empathy for their mother's grief (""My mom is already doing awful,"" ""I couldn't add the loss of a child to that""), and a newfound ""appreciation for my life"" due to witnessing grief. They state, ""I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry.""
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** The past intention (""was going to kill myself"") does not include any specific method, tool, or preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** The phrase ""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself"" describes a past *intention/plan*, not an initiated *action* (attempt).
    *   **Imminence:** The past intention is explicitly negated: ""Now, I know I can't do that."" The current state is one of aversion to suicide.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states they *cannot* and *do not* want to act on their previous suicidal thoughts, due to the impact on their mother. They express gaining ""a sort of appreciation for my life."" The current desire is *not* to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned, but it refers to a *past* intention.
    *   No, the post does *not* express a *current* clear desire to die. Instead, it expresses a clear *negation* of that desire (""I know I can't do that"") and a newfound appreciation for life.
    *   Yes, the writer explicitly states they *do not* want to act on the past thoughts/plans, indicating they are now unwanted. The phrase ""his passing has saved my life for the time being"" directly supports this.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned for the past intention.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no current desire to die, so no current plan/method/preparation is relevant.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a *past intention* (""I was going to kill myself"") and a *current change of mind/aversion* to that intention (""Now, I know I can't do that,"" ""his passing has saved my life for the time being"").
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author. ""I was going to"" implies a plan for the future at that time, not an action taken.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes past suicidal ideation (""I was going to kill myself"").
    *   However, the *current* sentiment is a clear negation of that ideation and a newfound appreciation for life, driven by a strong protective factor (not wanting to cause grief to their mother).
    *   It does not describe an initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   It does not describe a current plan or method, and the past intention is explicitly averted, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not express a *current* personal desire to die or current suicidal thoughts. Instead, it explicitly states that the previous suicidal thoughts are now unwanted and that the author has gained an appreciation for life.
    *   This fits the 'Indicator' definition: ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die**."" The author clearly states they ""can't do that"" and that the event ""saved my life for the time being,"" indicating the past thoughts are now unwanted or averted.

When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""serious thoughts about suicide for days,"" ""I always think about suicide,"" ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself,"" ""want to commit suicide.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depression,"" ""home life isn't that good,"" ""fight a lot,"" ""gets me so mad,"" ""social anxiety,"" ""seasonal depression,"" ""adds to the fire,"" ""feel like i'm doing it for attention,"" ""feel like i'm faking it,"" ""Am i being dramatic about this?""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself."" This is a key element. It's not a specific plan *yet*, but it's an active step (research) towards finding a method.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days"" refers to past ideation, not a past initiated attempt.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""When we fight I always think about suicide"" indicates recurring thoughts. ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"" suggests an ongoing or recent action. The self-doubt (""Am I faking?"") doesn't negate the presence of the thoughts or the research.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states ""I always think about suicide"" and ""want to commit suicide."" While they question if they are ""faking it,"" they still express the desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself,"" and expresses a clear desire to ""want to commit suicide.""
    *   No, the writer does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. The questioning (""Am I faking it?"") is about the legitimacy of the feelings, not a negation of the desire itself.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method/tool/location is not mentioned. However, ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"" is an active step towards identifying a method. This constitutes a preparatory action, even if the specific method isn't chosen yet. It moves beyond just thinking about suicide into a behavioral search for *how* to do it. This fits the 'Behavior' definition's inclusion of ""preparations being taken"" or ""intended action element.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes ongoing thoughts (""always think about suicide"") and an ongoing/recent action (""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"").
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past is described. ""Had serious thoughts"" is ideation, not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and desire (""want to commit suicide,"" ""kill myself""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The presence of ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"" is crucial. This is an active step taken by the author to find a method. While not a concrete plan, it's a form of preparation or an ""intended action element"" as described in the 'Behavior' definition. It goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts only) into a behavioral search for means. Therefore, it fits 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated lethal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent and the active step of researching methods, the classification is Behavior.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""Life is useless"" and ""Death and suicide need to be normalized."" This directly mentions suicide and expresses a negative view of life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Life is useless"" indicates hopelessness and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The description of ""the other side"" is abstract and philosophical (""without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being""), not a plan or method for achieving death.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No imminence. The statements are general and philosophical.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses that ""Life is useless"" and describes a desired state after death, implying a desire for life to end or for a different existence that is not living. The call to normalize ""Death and suicide"" further supports a personal acceptance or desire related to these concepts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""Life is useless"" combined with the desire for a non-existent state (""no hunger no body or mind. Just a being"") and the normalization of death/suicide strongly implies a desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer seems to embrace these thoughts and even advocate for them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. The description of ""the other side"" is not a method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: There is no high imminence.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a philosophical view on death/suicide, but no specific current/future intention to act.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""Life is useless,"" ""Death and suicide need to be normalized"") and a desire for life to end (describing a better ""other side""). This clearly goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - The clear personal expression of suicidal thoughts and desire for life to end, without being explicitly unwanted, rules out 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The post explicitly discusses ""the thought of death"" and describes it in positive terms (""beautiful,"" ""never feel pain anymore,"" ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""to be nothing,"" ""to let go"").
    - Emotional indicators: Expresses a longing for an end to pain and hassle, a desire for non-existence (""to be nothing in a black sea of infinity""). This indicates profound despair and a desire for cessation of suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). The tone is contemplative and longing.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer finds the *thought* of death beautiful and lists the personal benefits of non-existence, indicating a clear desire for life to end or for death.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. While not using direct suicide terms, the positive framing of ""the thought of death"" as an escape from pain and hassle, and a desire ""to be nothing,"" strongly conveys a personal desire for death/non-existence. This is not an abstract discussion but a personal reflection on the desirability of death.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the thoughts are presented as desirable and beautiful.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Is there a high imminence coupled with vague action? No specific action or high imminence is stated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current contemplation and desire for death/non-existence.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear personal desire for death/non-existence as a beautiful escape from pain and hassle (""Ain't the thought of death just beautiful? To never feel pain anymore. To be nothing...""). This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide. It represents a profound longing for life to end.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly, as it includes explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer or for life to end, without any specific plan, method, or action.

However, the phrase ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day"" combined with the explicit intent to ""kill myself"" and high imminence (tied to tomorrow's test results) implies an active intention to find and use a method. This is a crucial point for distinguishing Ideation from Behavior.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions ""I used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide,"" which refers to past *thoughts/feelings* about suicide, not a past initiated *action* or attempt.
    *   **Imminence:** High imminence. The decision and potential action are tied to getting COVID test results ""tomorrow."" The phrase ""as long as i don't see another day"" also suggests immediate intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a very clear and explicit desire to die and end their life (""i'll kill myself,"" ""don't see another day,"" ""my will to live... hanging by a thread"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""committing suicide.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die (""i'll kill myself,"" ""don't see another day,"" ""my will to live... hanging by a thread"").
    *   The writer does *not* state they do not want these thoughts; instead, they state the fear of death that *used to* hold them back is gone, indicating a current desire to act on these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method or preparation is named.
    *   However, the statement ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day"" is a critical indicator. When combined with the explicit intent to ""kill myself"" and the high imminence (tied to tomorrow's results), this phrase implies a commitment to finding and utilizing a means to act. It's not just a thought about dying; it's an intention to *act* by *any available method*. This crosses the threshold from pure Ideation to Behavior because it includes an element of intended action/planning, even if the specific method is not yet chosen. The intent is to find *a* method and use it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a future, conditional intention (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past. The mention of ""used to be afraid of death"" refers to past feelings/thoughts, not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal, and explicit desire to die and suicidal intent (""i'll kill myself"").
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past initiated suicidal action is described. The post focuses on a future intention.
    *   The distinction between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' is key here. While no *specific* method is named, the statement ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day"" combined with the high imminence (tomorrow's test results) and explicit intent to ""kill myself"" indicates more than just thoughts or a desire to die. It signifies a concrete intention to act and a willingness to find *any* means to do so. This constitutes an element of planning or intended action, even if vague on the specific method, pushing it into the 'Behavior' category. The individual is not just thinking about it; they are articulating a plan to act, contingent on a specific event, and are committed to finding a way to do it.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""kill myself"" twice and mentions a specific method: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Failrure"", ""burden"", ""disappoinment"", ""Pleasw help, i have nobody else"" indicate severe distress, hopelessness, self-loathing, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" describes a specific past action involving a method. ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" indicates a current search for a method/plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" clearly describes a past initiated action that was intended to be lethal but failed.
    *   **Imminence:** The phrase ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" suggests a current, ongoing desire to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die (""kill myself"", ""stop being a burden and a disappoinment"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""kill mslef"".
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""stop being a burden and a disappoinment"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""entire bottle o zopiclone"") was mentioned in relation to a past suicidal act. The question ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" implies seeking a future method/plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a past event (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"") and a current/future intention (""What shoul i do kill mslef"").
    *   It describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"". This is a clear description of a self-initiated action that was intended to be lethal, even though it failed (""nothing""). This directly fits the definition of an 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear suicidal ideation and a desire to die.
    *   It also describes a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that occurred in the past (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing""). This is a direct description of a suicide attempt.
    *   According to the definitions, 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present. The post explicitly states a past attempt (""took an entire bottle... and nothing"") and links it to their current distress and desire to die.

I might kill myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I might kill myself."" This is a direct statement of potential suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Hell,"" ""lesser human,"" ""pisses me off,"" ""feeling like I'm trying to navigate through Hell every fucking day,"" ""I feel like I don't belong in society."" These indicate profound distress, hopelessness, and feelings of alienation.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. There is no indication of how, where, or when, nor any tools or preparations.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide.
    - Imminence: ""I might kill myself"" suggests a current consideration or possibility, but not a definite or immediate plan. The word ""might"" softens the imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear expression of suicidal ideation (""I might kill myself"") stemming from deep distress and a feeling of not belonging. This is a personal desire for life to end, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I might kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I might kill myself"" clearly indicates a desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement is a direct expression of a potential action, not a rejection of the thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. The imminence is not ""high"" (""might"" rather than ""will"" or ""now""). There is no vague reference to *how* the action would be carried out.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a future *potential* intention.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal ideation (""I might kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator', as it's more than just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. The phrase ""I might kill myself"" indicates ideation or contemplation, not a concrete plan or action. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""Goodbye,"" ""I'm going to end it tonight,"" ""Goodbye world,"" ""I will be non existent.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""struggling with depression for god knows how long.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil."" This is a specific method (overdose) using specific substances.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""tonight,"" ""in about a few minutes."" This indicates extreme imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear and explicit desire to die and end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm going to end it,"" ""I will be non existent"").
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil."" This is a concrete plan involving specific substances. The high imminence further reinforces the planned action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current and future intention: ""I'm going to end it tonight,"" ""I will be non existent in about a few minutes.""
    - It does not describe a past, initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by including a specific plan/method (""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil"") and a high degree of imminence (""tonight,"" ""in about a few minutes""). This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition, which requires a plan, method, or intended action.
    - It describes an *intended* future action, not a *past initiated* action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""i want to kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""so physically uncomfortable,"" ""really miserable,"" ""couldnt stand being at home anymore."" These indicate significant distress and discomfort.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: The post refers to past misery (""I was really miserable,"" ""I couldnt stand being at home anymore"") and a memory gap from ""last year,"" but these are descriptions of feelings/states, not past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: The desire ""i want to kill myself"" is current, but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or immediate action is indicated.

    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - There is no vague reference to action that implies a method or plan, even with high imminence, as imminence is not explicitly high and no action is suggested beyond the desire.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current intention (""i want to kill myself"") and references past feelings/memory issues.
    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past. The past references are to emotional states and memory, not attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""i want to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts; it's a direct desire.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""kill myself"" (multiple times), ""die"" (multiple times), ""end myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""everything is shit"", ""not deserving of love or even fun"", ""deserve to die and suffer"". Shows profound despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""My initial plan was to kill myself anyways on my birthday."" ""And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks."" This indicates a specific date/time for the intended action, which constitutes a plan element.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""after my first failed attempt in October."" This is a direct, explicit mention of a past self-initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""on my birthday in two weeks."" This is a specific, near-future timeframe for the intended action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die (""life wants me to kill myself"", ""I deserve to die"", ""I will end myself"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific date for the intended action (""on my birthday in two weeks"") is part of a plan. The post also states, ""My initial plan was to kill myself anyways on my birthday,"" confirming a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past, specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author: ""my first failed attempt in October.""
    *   It also describes a current/future intention/plan: ""I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.""
    *   According to the definitions, if a post describes a past *initiated action* by the author, it should be classified as 'Attempt', even if current ideation or behavior is also present.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly shows strong suicidal ideation and a future plan (which would typically lead to 'Behavior').
    *   However, the crucial element is the explicit mention of a ""first failed attempt in October."" The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""last suicide attempt"", ""suicidal thoughts"", ""I think about death but not about doing it!"", ""helped me survive"".

And by kinda I mean they are gone."", ""I think about death but not about doing it!"", ""I feel really good."", ""magic miracle"", ""Thanks to all of you that helped me survive to this moment."" The current emotional state is positive and celebratory.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for the current time. The post explicitly negates current suicidal intent.
    - References to past actions: ""Today hits one month from my last suicide attempt"". This is a clear, self-reported past initiated action.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: No current imminent intentions; the post describes overcoming past suicidal thoughts/actions.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states they are *not* thinking about ""doing it"" and are celebrating surviving. They are expressing a desire *not* to die currently.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide attempt"", ""suicidal thoughts"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No, the post explicitly states the opposite: ""My suicidal thoughts kinda left. And by kinda I mean they are gone. I think about death but not about doing it! I feel really good.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I think about death but not about doing it!"".

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The post is about overcoming past suicidal tendencies.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past event (""my last suicide attempt"") and a current positive state (""one month from my last suicide attempt"", ""I feel really good"").
    - It describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past: ""my last suicide attempt"". This is a clear self-reported initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""my last suicide attempt"" and that ""Today hits one month from my last suicide attempt"". This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., ""many years ago"") if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" The author is celebrating this milestone, linking the past attempt to their current positive state.
    - Even though the current sentiment is positive and there is no current ideation or plan, the explicit mention of a past *initiated action* by the author themselves takes precedence and falls under the 'Attempt' category as per the rules.
    - It is not 'Indicator' because a concrete past attempt is stated.
    - It is not 'Ideation' because a concrete past attempt is stated, and there is no *current* ideation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared."" ""Hurt myself"" implies self-harm/suicide. ""Awful thoughts"" in this context strongly suggests suicidal ideation.
    - Emotional indicators: ""can't take it anymore,"" ""frustrating to hold my tears,"" ""eyes are burning,"" ""can't sleep,"" ""can't bring myself to do what I enjoy,"" ""felt guilty,"" ""so tired,"" ""drowning in these awful thoughts,"" ""so scared."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, anhedonia, and fear.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself.""
    - References to past actions: None related to self-harm/suicide.
    - Imminence: ""I've been drowning in these awful thoughts"" suggests ongoing, current distress.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses deep distress and fear *about* the ""awful thoughts,"" rather than a clear desire to act on them. The phrase ""I'm so scared"" in relation to these thoughts, along with the explicit negation of a plan, suggests the thoughts are intrusive or unwanted, not a personal desire.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, it uses ""hurt myself"" and ""awful thoughts.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The primary sentiment is distress and fear *of* the thoughts, not a desire to die. ""Can't take it anymore"" is general distress.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared."" The ""scared"" part indicates the thoughts are unwanted and distressing, and the lack of a plan further supports this.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" This directly negates the presence of a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current distress and ongoing ""awful thoughts.""
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly indicates the presence of ""awful thoughts"" which are implied to be suicidal in nature (""hurt myself"").
    - However, the author explicitly states ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"" and expresses being ""so scared"" of these thoughts.
    - According to the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" This post perfectly fits this criterion. The author is experiencing suicidal thoughts but is distressed by them and does not express a desire to act on them, nor do they have a plan.
    - It is not 'Ideation' because the thoughts are presented as unwanted and feared, rather than a personal desire to die.
    - It is not 'Behavior' because there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned; in fact, it's explicitly negated.
    - It is not 'Attempt' because no past initiated action is described.

I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool.

        *   ""...I've never purposely hurt myself..."" - Explicitly states no past self-harm *actions*.
        *   ""Hopefully the roof collapses or my matress turns into a large mouth and eats me or some stupid shit"" - Passive death wish, not a self-initiated action or plan.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""hate being alive,"" ""hate myself""), despair, anhedonia (""don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore""), feeling like a burden (implied by ""parents will be sad dummy""), self-loathing (""I'm the fattest I've ever been,"" ""dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant,"" ""pathetic,"" ""man baby"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned for suicide. The self-harm ideation is explicitly stated as only ""in my head"" and ""never purposely hurt myself.""
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I was hospitalized in highschool for depression"" - Hospitalization for depression, not explicitly for a suicide attempt. The author explicitly states they ""never purposely hurt myself.""
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""every fucking day all the fucking time"" indicates high frequency of thoughts, but no immediate plan or imminence of *action*.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I hate being alive,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day""). Not expressing distress about *unwanted* thoughts, but rather expressing the thoughts as a personal desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day"" are direct expressions of death intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to die,"" ""I fucking hate being alive.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the thoughts are presented as genuine personal feelings, not unwanted intrusions. The only reason given for not acting is ""your parents will be sad dummy,"" which is an external deterrent, not a negation of the desire itself.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   No vague reference to action implying a method or plan with high imminence. The self-harm ideation is explicitly stated as not acted upon. The passive death wishes are not self-initiated plans.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. Past hospitalization for depression, current desire to die and daily suicidal thoughts.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The hospitalization was for depression, not a suicide attempt. The author explicitly states ""I've never purposely hurt myself.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I fucking hate being alive"") and frequent suicidal thoughts (""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time""). This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for suicide. The self-harm ideation is explicitly stated as never acted upon and only occurring ""in my head."" This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action. The hospitalization was for depression, not an attempt, and the author explicitly states they've never purposely hurt themselves. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" - this is a clear expression of a desire for death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""hurting,"" ""hurt so bad emotionally,"" ""so depressed,"" ""exhausting,"" ""my own body is giving up."" - indicates profound despair, hopelessness, and physical manifestation of emotional pain.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method (like pills, gun, jumping), or preparation (like writing a note) is mentioned. ""die in my sleep"" is a passive wish, not an active method.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""tonight"" - high imminence for the *hope* of dying.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a genuine wish for life to end (""hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" is a clear desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a hope, not an unwanted thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""die in my sleep"" is a passive wish, not an active method or plan.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: While imminence is high (""tonight""), the stated ""action"" (""die in my sleep"") is passive and does not imply an active, self-initiated method or plan by the author. It's a wish for an external event (death in sleep) rather than an intention to perform an action to cause death.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/hope for a future event (""tonight"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire for life to end (""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - It does not contain any specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out a suicidal act. The wish to ""die in sleep"" is a passive desire for life to end, not an active plan or intended action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The desire for death is explicit and personal, not merely general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

243,"Zoloft overdose. So at 11:30 I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg and It obviously wasn't enough to kill me, I feel completely fine now apart from slight nausea and I'm really sweaty, will I be okay if I don't go to hospital?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""Zoloft overdose,"" ""wasn't enough to kill me."" This explicitly indicates a suicidal act and a specific method (pills/overdose).
    - Emotional indicators: The primary focus is on the physical outcome and concern about health after the overdose, implying distress that led to the action.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"" is a specific action with a method and quantity.
    - References to past actions: ""at 11:30 I took 6 pills"" describes an action that has already occurred very recently. ""wasn't enough to kill me"" confirms the suicidal intent behind this initiated action.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: The action has already happened.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" clearly indicates a desire to die that prompted the action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly states ""wasn't enough to kill me,"" indicating a clear desire to die and that an action was taken with that intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""Zoloft overdose,"" ""took 6 pills"") is clearly mentioned as having been carried out. This is not a future plan but a completed action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past event: ""at 11:30 I took..."" This is a specific action that has already occurred.
    - It describes a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author: ""I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"" with the stated intent to die (""wasn't enough to kill me""). This fits the definition of an initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post describes a concrete, self-initiated action (""took 6 pills"") that was intended to be lethal (""wasn't enough to kill me""). This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The fact that it happened ""at 11:30"" makes it a very recent past action.
    - It is not 'Indicator' as there is clear suicidal intent and action.
    - It is not 'Ideation' as a concrete action was taken, not just thoughts or desires.
    - It is not 'Behavior' because 'Behavior' refers to a *current/future* plan or intended action, whereas this post describes an action that has *already occurred*. The 'Attempt' category specifically covers past or very recent initiated actions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" ""it's soon,"" ""hope my plan works,"" ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up."" These phrases strongly imply a decision to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""chronic stress,"" ""hellish trauma,"" ""beaten up,"" ""severe chronic fatigue syndrome,"" ""sign up for disability"" indicate distress. ""I feel so calm about it. At peace knowing it's soon"" indicates a concerning sense of resolve and acceptance of the decision.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states ""Hope my plan works though."" While no *details* of the plan are given, the *existence* of a plan is mentioned by the author.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""it's soon."" This indicates high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to end life (""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words, but the phrases ""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" ""no way I'm living,"" and ""hope my plan works"" clearly convey suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, unequivocally. ""No way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses calm and peace about their decision and its imminence, indicating a desire *to* act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method is described.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations (like writing a note or acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. The post explicitly states ""Hope my plan works though."" This is a direct mention of a ""plan"" by the author, coupled with high imminence (""soon"") and clear intent. Even without details, the *statement* of a plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current decision and future intention (""destined to do it,"" ""it's soon,"" ""hope my plan works"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   This is clearly not 'Indicator' as there is a strong, personal, current expression of suicidal intent and desire to die.
    *   The post goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because it explicitly mentions having a ""plan"" (""Hope my plan works though""). While the details of the plan are absent, the *existence* of a plan, combined with high imminence (""soon"") and a clear desire to act, fits the definition of 'Behavior' (""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"").
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past initiated action is described.

Based on the explicit mention of a ""plan"" in conjunction with clear suicidal intent and high imminence, the most appropriate classification is 'Behavior'.

I can deal with difficulties in life but realizing you're hopeless is too much. I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better. I just want to find an actual suicide forum.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states, ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum."" This is a direct reference to suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Hopeless,"" ""felt hopeless for months,"" ""realizing you're hopeless is too much."" These indicate severe despair and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation for *committing* suicide is mentioned. The desire to find a forum is about seeking information or community, not a direct plan of action.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence: No imminence regarding an *action* is mentioned (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). The desire to find a forum is a current state of mind.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses profound hopelessness and a clear desire to engage with the topic of suicide by seeking a ""suicide forum."" This implies a personal desire related to suicide, not a statement about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide forum.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the profound hopelessness (""realizing you're hopeless is too much"") combined with the active search for a ""suicide forum"" strongly implies a personal desire to engage with suicidal ideation or a desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they are actively seeking out a forum related to suicide.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: There is no vague reference to an *action* or *method* of suicide itself, only the intention to find a forum.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings of hopelessness and a current intention to find a suicide forum.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post goes beyond general distress (""Indicator"") because it explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a clear personal desire to engage with the topic (by seeking a ""suicide forum"") in the context of profound hopelessness. This indicates active suicidal thoughts or feelings.
    - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for suicide itself. Seeking a forum is a step related to suicidal ideation, but not a plan or action for carrying it out. Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts/feelings (implied by seeking a suicide forum in a state of hopelessness) without a specific plan or action. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

Idc if no one responds I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die even though I know it's painful idc just want an end",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""trying to slash my wrists and die"" - clear mention of self-harm method and desire for death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""disgusting to look at,"" ""low my expectations,"" ""Why couldn't I get even that?"", ""idc if no one responds,"" ""just want an end"" - indicates self-loathing, hopelessness, despair, and a desire for suffering to cease.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""slash my wrists"" is a specific method.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I tried, I guess."" This is vague. In context, it seems to refer to trying to cope or get help (""wanted my mother to tell me it'll be okay""), rather than a past suicidal act. The subsequent statement about ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists"" refers to a current/imminent intention.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die"" - very high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""just want an end,"" ""die"" - clear desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but it explicitly states ""die"" and ""want an end"" in a suicidal context.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""just want an end,"" ""die.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses being ""on the verge of trying"" to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""slash my wrists"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but ""on the verge of trying"" implies immediate intent to act.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Here, the method (""slash my wrists"") is specific, not vague, and coupled with high imminence and clear intent to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future imminent intention (""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists""). The phrase ""I tried, I guess"" is too vague to indicate a past *suicidal action* and seems more related to past coping efforts or attempts to get support.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The action ""slash my wrists"" is presented as something the author is ""on the verge of trying,"" indicating a current, imminent intention, not a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is clear personal suicidal intent and a specific method mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because a specific method (""slash my wrists"") is mentioned, moving it beyond mere thoughts or desire without a plan/method.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits perfectly. The post expresses a clear desire to die (""just want an end,"" ""die"") and explicitly mentions a specific method (""slash my wrists"") with high imminence (""on the verge of trying""). This aligns with the definition of Behavior: ""The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die... AND also mentions... a specific method... or an intended action.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. While ""I tried, I guess"" is present, it does not describe a *specific, initiated, potentially lethal action* by the author in the past. The specific action mentioned (""slash my wrists"") is described as a current, imminent intention, not a past completed or initiated act.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""I cannot wait to die"" and mentions ""at least the pain will all be gone,"" which directly refers to death as an end to suffering. It also mentions ""ill fix all of the funeral costs,"" which is a clear reference to the aftermath of death, implying preparation for it.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""my life is not able to be fixed,"" ""no-one I know has gone through the things I have gone through,"" ""bullshit phase,"" ""pain will all be gone."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and a belief that their situation is unique and beyond repair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** No specific method (like pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned. However, ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"" is a clear statement of preparation for death.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I cannot wait to die"" suggests a strong desire for it to happen, but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") for the *act* itself is given. The preparation for funeral costs implies a future event being planned for.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire to die (""I cannot wait to die"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words, but ""I cannot wait to die"" is a direct expression of desire for death.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to die is clearly expressed and embraced.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"" is a clear and concrete preparation for death, indicating a step being taken or intended to be taken in anticipation of a suicidal act. This fits the 'preparations being taken' aspect of the Behavior definition.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of despair and a future intention (""I cannot wait to die"") with a stated preparation for that future event (""ill fix all of the funeral costs"").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because while there is clear ideation (""I cannot wait to die""), there is also a concrete mention of preparation (""ill fix all of the funeral costs""). This moves it beyond mere thoughts or desires.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post expresses explicit personal suicidal desire (""I cannot wait to die"") AND mentions a preparation being taken (""ill fix all of the funeral costs""). This preparation, while not a method, is a concrete action or intended action related to the suicide, aligning with the definition of Behavior.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past initiated action is described.

Therefore, the presence of a clear desire to die combined with a stated preparation for the aftermath of death (funeral costs) places this post in the 'Behavior' category.

(Forgive me if I am being egoic / self-indulgent)",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No explicit mentions.
    - Emotional indicators: ""if life won't ever be as good again, what's really the point?"", ""destined to live a depressed life"", ""can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and a sense of meaninglessness regarding future life.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: Mentions past happiness (""the summer of my life is over. i have enjoyed perfect happiness. everything that made my happiness has now left me."") but no past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: No specific intentions are stated. The question ""what's really the point?"" expresses a lack of purpose, not an immediate intent to act.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrase ""what's really the point?"" when coupled with the belief that ""life won't ever be as good again"" and being ""destined to live a depressed life"" strongly implies a questioning of the value of continuing to live under such conditions. It's a profound expression of hopelessness about life's future value, which aligns with a desire for life to end if it cannot be good. It is not explicitly stated as unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the phrase ""if life won't ever be as good again, what's really the point?"" in the context of deep despair (""destined to live a depressed life"") is a strong expression of the perceived meaninglessness of continued existence, which falls under ""profound expressions of wanting life to end"" as per the Ideation definition.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post does not negate the sentiment; it expresses it as a genuine dilemma.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - No vague reference to action implying a method or plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current state of profound despair and a bleak outlook on the future.
    - It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past or present.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses deep hopelessness and questions the purpose of continued life (""what's really the point?"") if future happiness is impossible. This goes beyond general distress and enters the realm of questioning the value of existence itself, which aligns with the Ideation definition's ""profound expressions of wanting life to end"" or ""desire to not be alive any longer."" It's not an Indicator because the questioning of ""the point"" of life is a direct result of the perceived permanent negative state, implying a desire for that state (and thus life) to end.
    - There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - There are no mentions of past initiated actions, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

I live in NYC and I'm just here to find out what's the best bet if I where to jump from a bridge which one do I have the highest chance of death but even if no one answers I'm gonna pick one by the weekend so wish me luck hopefully everything pans out the way I want,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""jump from a bridge,"" ""highest chance of death,"" ""hopefully everything pans out the way I want"" (implying successful death).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Underlying despair, but not explicitly stated. The focus is on the plan.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""jump from a bridge"" (specific method). ""which one do I have the highest chance of death"" (seeking specific location/details for the method). ""gonna pick one by the weekend"" (clear, imminent preparation/decision to act).
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""by the weekend"" indicates high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die, expressed through seeking information on the most effective method and hoping for a successful outcome.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""jump from a bridge"" with the goal of ""highest chance of death"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""highest chance of death"" and ""hopefully everything pans out the way I want"" (referring to dying).
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite; they are actively planning to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""jump from a bridge"" is a specific method. The user is asking for specific *locations* for this method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""gonna pick one by the weekend"" is a clear indication of an imminent decision to act and preparation.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Here, the method (""jump from a bridge"") is specific, and the imminence (""by the weekend"") is high, along with active seeking of information for the plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""gonna pick one by the weekend"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die (""highest chance of death,"" ""hopefully everything pans out the way I want""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""jump from a bridge"") and an imminent plan/preparation (""gonna pick one by the weekend""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   The post describes a future intended action, not a past initiated action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Given the explicit suicidal intent, the specific method mentioned, and the clear, imminent plan to act, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

Not just them, I just need someone in my life who would see that I am trying, who would see that this is not who I want to be. But this is how it supposed to be, right? I supposed to be an alien, I supposed to suffer. This is my place in the world. I am here to live in pain. I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny, right? Do I deserve it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states, ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free."" This is a statement of despair about *not* being able to die and be free from pain. While not a direct ""I want to die,"" it implies a desire for release that death would bring. No mentions of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""never understands me,"" ""treat me like shit,"" ""need someone,"" ""not who I want to be,"" ""alien,"" ""suffer,"" ""live in pain,"" ""pain will never loosen it's grip,"" ""destiny."" These indicate deep despair, hopelessness, isolation, and a profound sense of suffering and being trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No direct intentions are stated. The statements are about a perceived perpetual state of suffering.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses profound distress and a belief that they are condemned to live in pain and will never be free or die. This strongly implies a desire for an end to this painful existence, even if framed as an unattainable wish or a lament about their perceived fate. It is not stated as unwanted thoughts; it is a personal statement of their perceived reality and desire for release.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** The phrases ""I am here to live in pain,"" ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free,"" and ""The pain will never loosen it's grip"" collectively express a profound desire for an end to their current painful existence. While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the lament about *not* dying and *not* being free strongly implies that death or release from this pain is desired. This goes beyond general distress and indicates a wish for life to end in its current form.
    *   **Explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the statements are presented as their personal conviction and reality.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a perceived future state of suffering. There are no descriptions of past or future initiated actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound despair, hopelessness, and a strong implicit desire for an end to suffering, lamenting that they ""will never die"" and ""will never be free"" from pain. This is a ""profound expression of wanting life to end"" even if not explicitly saying ""I want to die."" It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because of the depth of the desire for release from pain, which death would bring.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (ruling out Behavior).
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action (ruling out Attempt).
    *   Therefore, the most fitting category is 'Ideation' due to the profound expressions of wanting an end to life/suffering, even if framed as a lament about its impossibility.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions the sister ""willingly and voluntarily ended her life"" (suicide) and ""had made attempts in the past."" Crucially, the author states, ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" This is a direct admission of a past self-initiated suicidal action. The author also expresses a desire for life to end: ""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"" and ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""What's the point?"", ""can't shake the pain,"" ""so many questions and so much doubt about myself,"" ""I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore,"" ""However little I think I'm worth as an individual."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and low self-worth.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for *current* suicidal intent. The past ""aborted attempt"" doesn't specify a method in this post.
    *   **References to past actions:** The author explicitly states: ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" This is a clear, self-initiated past action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The author states, ""other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."" and ""At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from."" This indicates current suicidal ideation.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for life to end (""welcome end to everything,"" ""sleep lasting forever is hard to turn away from""). This is not presented as unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""aborted attempt at suicide"" by the author.
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end (""welcome end to everything,"" ""sleep lasting forever"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for *current* suicidal intent. The past attempt is mentioned without method detail.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a past event and current feelings/intentions.
    *   It describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past: ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" The term ""attempt"" signifies an initiated action. The fact that it was ""aborted"" means it was stopped or failed, but it was still an initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly contains current suicidal ideation (desire for life to end, ""welcome end to everything""). This would fall under 'Ideation'.
    *   However, the post also explicitly describes a past, self-initiated suicidal action by the author: ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""
    *   According to the definitions, 'Attempt' applies when ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., ""many years ago"") if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    *   The author brings up this past attempt in the context of their current struggles and feelings (""But now I find myself in a different place"").
    *   The rule states that 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.

Therefore, the most accurate classification is 'Attempt'.

There's no emotion anymore. No sadness, its just nothing. The pain in numb now, but that's nothing new. I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess. I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""I can't continue this disappointment"" implies ending a situation, likely life. ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" is a direct statement of a plan and a specific location/method for a suicidal act. ""less of a mess"" strongly confirms the context of a suicidal act.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""disappointment,"" ""nothing,"" ""no hope,"" ""no joy,"" ""no emotion,"" ""numb pain."" These indicate severe hopelessness, anhedonia, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" is a clear, specific plan with a method (implied by ""in the tub"" - e.g., drowning, cutting, electrocution) and location. The phrase ""less of a mess"" reinforces this as a suicidal act. The apology and ""Thank You"" (""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You."") function as a farewell note, which is a preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I plan on doing it"" indicates a current, active intention to act. The overall tone suggests high imminence.
    *   **Stated desire:** ""I can't continue this disappointment,"" ""it doesn't matter,"" ""its for the best"" (referring to the planned act) clearly convey a desire for life to end and to act on that desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly with those words.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the combination of profound despair, the statement ""I can't continue this disappointment,"" and the explicit plan ""I plan on doing it"" clearly indicate a desire to die and to act on it.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is expressing an intent to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""in the tub"" is a specific location directly tied to the planned act, implying a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the farewell message (""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You."") is a clear sign of preparation.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Here, the method is not vague (""in the tub"") and the intent/imminence are very high.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention: ""I plan on doing it in the tub.""
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire for life to end and an intent to act (""I can't continue this,"" ""I plan on doing it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Beyond just expressing suicidal thoughts or a desire to die, the post explicitly states a plan (""I plan on doing it""), mentions a specific location/method (""in the tub""), and includes elements of preparation (the farewell message). This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a past, initiated suicidal action by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific plan, method, and preparation clearly fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

253,Can someone just hug me please. I just want the pain to go away,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""pain"" (distress, suffering), ""want the pain to go away"" (desire for relief from suffering). ""Can someone just hug me please"" indicates a need for comfort and support.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: No intentions stated.
    - Writer's stated desire: Expresses a desire for emotional pain to cease and a need for comfort. It does not explicitly state a desire to die or for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The phrase ""I just want the pain to go away"" expresses a desire for relief from suffering, which is not synonymous with a desire to die. It's a common expression of distress.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.
    - Conclusion for Step 2: There is no explicit suicidal intent.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Not applicable, as explicit desire to die is not present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current distress and a plea for comfort.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress (""pain"") and a need for comfort (""hug me"").
    - It lacks any clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. The phrase ""I just want the pain to go away"" is an expression of suffering and a desire for relief, not an explicit statement of suicidal ideation.
    - There are no mentions of plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
    - Therefore, it best fits the 'Indicator' category, as it expresses general distress without explicit suicidal intent.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" This is direct suicidal intent. It also describes self-harming behaviors: ""I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants... secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing."" This describes misuse of medication (paracetamol leading to liver damage) and starvation, both of which are potentially lethal self-harming actions.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming feelings of despair, hopelessness, failure, neglect, trauma, loneliness, rage, and a desire for life to end. Phrases like ""sick of being epileptic,"" ""melancholic mind,"" ""crippling depressives reaction,"" ""suffocated me with my evil thoughts,"" ""Life is miserably unfair,"" ""absolute failure,"" ""failed miserably,"" ""never deserved anything.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post describes a *method* (misuse of paracetamol, starvation) and *actions* taken (taking pills, starving) that have resulted in physical harm (damaged liver, digestive system). While the initial stated intent for these actions was ""to cope,"" they are described within a post titled ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and are physically damaging and potentially lethal.
    *   **References to past actions:** The description of taking painkillers/paracetamol and starving oneself is presented as a past/ongoing initiated action that has already caused physical damage (""It damaged my liver my digestive system"").
    *   **Imminence:** ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" suggests current and possibly near-future intent. The self-harming behaviors are described as having occurred and caused damage.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A clear desire to ""end it."" The suicidal thoughts are not presented as unwanted but as leading to the desire to end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""wanting to end it"" are explicit.
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire for life to end.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post describes specific actions taken: ""Taking pain killers and antidepressants... led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food."" These are concrete methods (misuse of medication, starvation) and actions (taking pills, starving) that have caused physical harm. Paracetamol overdose is a common and potentially lethal method. Starvation is also potentially lethal. These are not just thoughts or vague plans; they are initiated actions with severe consequences.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both current/future intention (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"") and past/ongoing initiated actions (""I started Taking... led to my addiction... It damaged my liver... I starve my self"").
    *   The description of taking paracetamol to the point of liver damage and starving oneself are specific, self-initiated actions by the author that are potentially lethal and have resulted in physical harm. This fits the definition of an 'Attempt', which includes past or very recent self-initiated actions that were potentially lethal. The fact that the actions caused liver damage and digestive issues confirms they were initiated and had significant impact.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The explicit suicidal intent rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The description of concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (misuse of paracetamol leading to liver damage, starvation) that have already occurred and caused harm goes beyond mere 'Ideation' (thoughts/desire without plan/action) or 'Behavior' (current/future plan/intended action).
    *   The post clearly describes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... or ultimately failed to cause death."" The liver damage from paracetamol misuse and the starvation are such actions. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most fitting category, as it takes precedence when a past initiated action is clearly described.

        *   ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" (specific method, location, and plan)
        *   ""I feel like cutting myself again."" (self-harm, implies past action)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I have no one""), despair, loss, anger (""Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything."").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, a very specific plan involving a train station, train tracks, and a train.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""getting over suicidal thoughts"" (past ideation), ""cutting myself again"" (past self-harm). There is no description of a past *suicide attempt* (i.e., a past initiated potentially lethal action).
    *   **Imminence:** ""I really want to fucking kill myself,"" ""I'm thinking about running away to the train station..."" (current intention, implies potential for immediate action).
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die (""I really want to fucking kill myself"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly states ""I really want to fucking kill myself.""
    *   Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die.
    *   No, the writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions; the desire is explicit.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method and location are mentioned: ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" This is a clear plan and intended action.
    *   There are no explicit preparations like writing a note, but the intention to ""run away to the train station"" implies an immediate step towards the plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past experiences (""getting over suicidal thoughts,"" ""cutting myself again"") and a strong current/future intention (""I really want to fucking kill myself,"" ""I'm thinking about running away to the train station..."").
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* by the author in the past as a suicide attempt. While ""cutting myself again"" refers to past self-harm, the primary suicidal content is the *current* explicit desire and the *current* specific plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is a clear, explicit, current personal expression of desire to die (""I really want to fucking kill myself"").
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post includes not just suicidal thoughts/desire, but also a specific plan, method, and intended action (""running away to the train station... lay my head on the train tracks... let a train crush my head"").
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a specific plan, method, and intended action for carrying it out.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the post does not describe a *past initiated potentially lethal action* by the author that was a suicide attempt. It mentions past self-harm and past suicidal thoughts, but the specific, potentially lethal action (train tracks) is a *current plan*, not a past attempt.

    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""wanted to die,"" ""suicide attempts,"" ""kill myself,"" ""not allowed to die,"" ""lets me die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""Every day for 4,808. I have wanted to die.""), anger (""jealous and pissed as fuck""), despair (""mess,"" ""trash,"" ""depressed""), anhedonia (""The only times I have been happy the past few years has been to alter my state of reality"").
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** No current specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a *future* act.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I had a few suicide attempts,"" ""the most successful attempt involved me being saved."" This clearly describes past initiated suicidal actions by the author.
    *   **Imminence:** The desire to die is long-standing (""Every day for 4,808""). No immediate future action is stated, but the desire is constant.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die (""I have wanted to die,"" ""I should be able to kill myself,"" ""world lets me die""). This is not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a genuine desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I have wanted to die,"" ""I should be able to kill myself,"" ""world lets me die"").
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they express a strong desire for them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a *current or future* suicidal act. The post refers to *past* attempts but not current planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a past event (""I had a few suicide attempts,"" ""the most successful attempt involved me being saved"") and a current, ongoing desire (""Every day for 4,808. I have wanted to die."").
    *   It clearly describes *specific, potentially lethal actions* initiated by the author in the past: ""I had a few suicide attempts,"" and ""the most successful attempt involved me being saved."" This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""I had a few suicide attempts"" and provides a detail about one (""the most successful attempt involved me being saved""). This directly aligns with the 'Attempt' definition: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""
    *   Even though there is strong current ideation (""I have wanted to die,"" ""I should be able to kill myself""), the rule states that 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""Trying to kill myself"" (repeated several times), ""end my own life,"" ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" The ""math is off"" part hints at a method like overdose, implying a specific type of action.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""guilty,"" ""pain,"" ""anger,"" ""shame for failing,"" ""loser,"" ""don't care,"" ""fuck me."" These indicate profound despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" This describes a clear intention to use a *new, specific (though unnamed) method* that is designed to be more effective and harder to reverse. The ""math is off"" part suggests a calculated method (like an overdose).
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real."" ""I feel shame for failing."" ""I'm going to try again."" These phrases explicitly state that the author has *tried* to kill themselves in the past and *failed*.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I'm going to try again,"" ""I think tommorow maybe. But I don't know. I have plenty of opportunities. Maybe tommorow, maybe next week, maybe next month, maybe next year."" While the exact timing is uncertain, ""tomorrow maybe"" indicates consideration of immediate action, and the firm ""I'm going to try again"" shows a clear future intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and strong desire to die and end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""end my own life.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they state a clear intention to act on them (""I'm going to try again"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a method is strongly implied and being sought: ""a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" This indicates a specific type of method (e.g., overdose) is being considered or planned for, and the intent to act is clear.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a past event and a future intention.
    *   **Past event:** ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real,"" ""I feel shame for failing,"" ""not being able to get over my own survival instincts."" These phrases explicitly describe a *past initiated action* by the author that was a suicide attempt and failed.
    *   **Future intention:** ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method."" This is a clear statement of future intent to act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong elements of 'Ideation' (clear desire to die) and 'Behavior' (clear intent to act again, with a described search for a more effective method).
    *   However, the crucial element is the explicit mention of a *past initiated action* by the author: ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real,"" and ""I feel shame for failing."" This directly describes a past suicide attempt.
    *   According to the rules, ""'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present."" Therefore, despite the strong 'Behavior' components, the clear description of a past attempt makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate classification.

258,Satanic Groundhog day. A day feels like a month. Brain really hurts. No income. Nothing to do. Reminded every second of others successes. Even as I type this. No bueno. I used to feel entertained and not in hell watching Judge Judy and Heidi Klum. Nope. I hate everything. No money will rot your brain. It's over. All I want is courage to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The phrase ""All I want is courage to end it"" is a clear, direct expression of suicidal intent. ""It's over"" also conveys a sense of finality and hopelessness related to life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Satanic Groundhog day,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No income,"" ""Nothing to do,"" ""Reminded every second of others successes,"" ""No bueno,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""No money will rot your brain."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, anhedonia, and feelings of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The desire is to ""end it,"" but *how* is not specified.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** ""All I want is courage to end it"" expresses a current desire, but the qualifier ""courage"" suggests a barrier to immediate action, rather than an immediate plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a very clear and explicit wish to die or for life to end (""All I want is courage to end it"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it"" is a strong euphemism for ending one's life.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""All I want is courage to end it"" is a clear expression of a desire for life to end. ""It's over"" also contributes to this.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite; they *desire* the courage to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. While ""end it"" is an action, there's no indication of *how* it would be done. The phrase ""courage to end it"" implies a desire to act but no specific means or steps towards a plan. There is no ""make this pain physical"" or similar vague action that implies a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of profound despair and a current desire/intention (""All I want is courage to end it"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""All I want is courage to end it"") and profound hopelessness (""I hate everything,"" ""It's over""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action (beyond the desire to ""end it""), or preparations. The phrase ""courage to end it"" expresses a desire to act but does not describe *how* or *with what*. This lack of specific planning or action prevents it from being classified as 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I'm going out,"" ""going out of this world,"" ""offing myself."" These are direct and explicit statements of ending one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm not worth living"" indicates profound hopelessness and low self-worth. ""Goodbye world"" is a farewell.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** A highly specific date and time are given: ""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours."" This is a concrete *plan* for *when* the action will occur. The farewell ""Goodbye world"" also suggests preparation. While a *method* (e.g., pills, gun) isn't named, the specificity of the *timing* and the farewell strongly imply a concrete plan for action.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** Extremely high. The post specifies a precise date and time in the very near future (implied to be the same day the post is written, or very soon).
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I'm not worth living and I'm offing myself then."" This is a clear, personal desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""offing myself"" is an explicit direct phrase.
    *   Yes, ""I'm not worth living and I'm offing myself then. Goodbye world"" expresses a clear desire to die and for life to end.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is *not* mentioned. However, a highly specific *time and date* for the intended action is given, which constitutes a concrete *plan* for *when* the act will occur. The phrase ""I'm going out of this world at that time"" and ""I'm offing myself then"" clearly states an *intended action*. The ""Goodbye world"" also serves as a sign of preparation/farewell. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a plan to commit suicide"" and ""an intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence), or preparations being taken."" The specific time/date and farewell meet these criteria.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a very specific *future intention* (""I'm going out... at that time"").
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'm not worth living,"" ""offing myself,"" ""Goodbye world""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because it includes a highly specific *plan* for *when* the action will occur (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours"") and a clear statement of *intended action* (""I'm going out,"" ""I'm offing myself then""). The specific timing and farewell indicate a concrete plan and preparations, even without a named method. This fits the 'Behavior' definition: ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide... or an intended action... or preparations being taken.""
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent, the highly specific timing of the intended action (a plan), and the farewell, this falls under Behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Explicitly mentions ""kill myself"": Yes.
    *   Expresses clear desire to die/not be alive: Yes (""I dont want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefuly"").
    *   States thoughts are unwanted: No, the desire is clearly personal and stated.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned: No.
    *   Signs of preparation: No.
    *   Vague reference to action implying method/plan with high imminence: No. The drinking is presented as a current coping mechanism, not a suicidal action. There is no other phrase that implies a *how* they would act on the suicidal desire.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Describes a past event, current/future intention, or both? Primarily current/future intention (""I want to kill myself so bad,"" ""It will never be better"").
    *   Describes a specific, potentially lethal action initiated in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is a clear, explicit, personal desire to die and kill oneself, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Fits well. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""I want to kill myself so bad,"" ""I don't want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefuly""). There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for carrying out these thoughts.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. While the intent is high and the desire is strong, there is no mention of *how* the author intends to act, no specific method, no tools, no location, and no preparations. The drinking is a coping mechanism, not a stated suicidal method.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. There is no description of any past or very recent self-initiated potentially lethal action.

    Therefore, the post clearly falls under Ideation due to the explicit and strong personal expression of suicidal desire without any associated plan, method, or preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" strongly implies the author's absence, i.e., death. ""I have to make it stop"" in the context of ""can't do this anymore"" and causing ""upset and pain and hurt"" suggests ending their life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""can't do this anymore""), despair, feeling like a burden (""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause""), self-blame.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I have to make it stop"" suggests a current, urgent desire.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for their life to end (""Happier Without Me"") and to end their suffering/existence (""make it stop""). This is not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a personal desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" and ""I have to make it stop"" in this context clearly convey a desire for their life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite. The writer expresses a personal desire to ""make it stop.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. ""Make it stop"" is an action, but it's entirely devoid of *how* it would be stopped. It doesn't imply a physical method or tool.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""I have to make it stop"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear personal desire for life to end and to ""make it stop"" due to pain and feeling like a burden. This is more than general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a direct expression of suicidal ideation. Therefore, it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   While there is a strong desire to end things, there is absolutely no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action (beyond the vague ""make it stop""), or preparations. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a plan, method, or preparation. Without this, it falls under 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on this analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire to die/end life without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The post explicitly states a *barrier* to action: ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital."" This indicates a desire to act but a lack of a perceived reliable method or fear of the negative consequences of a failed attempt.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past *initiated suicidal actions* are mentioned. ""I tried going to therapy"" is a coping attempt, not a suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** High imminence: ""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge,"" ""I just can't do this."" The phrase ""I would have done it already"" indicates a strong, ongoing desire to act, currently held back by a specific fear.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die/end life. The fear is of a *failed* attempt and its consequences, not of death itself.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I would have done it already,"" ""if I did it.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge,"" ""I just can't do this,"" ""nothing is better than this,"" ""It has to be better.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a clear desire to act, but is deterred by the fear of a botched outcome.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The post says ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it."" This is a strong statement of intent and imminence, but the *reason* for not having acted is explicitly the *fear of a failed attempt*, which implies a *lack* of a concrete, reliable plan or method. This prevents it from being classified as 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current intentions and feelings (""I'm on the edge,"" ""I can't anymore"") and past contemplation (""I would have done it already"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. ""I would have done it already"" is a hypothetical statement about past unfulfilled intent, not a description of an initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, explicit, and highly imminent expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'm on the edge,"" ""I can't anymore,"" ""I would have done it already""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The stated barrier to action (""afraid of botching it"") reinforces the *absence* of a concrete plan or method the author feels confident in. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past *initiated* suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer... but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

263,"Ramble about hating myself. Just joined but I have a problem. I'm a 30 year old Male single parent of a 7 about to be 8 year old son. I can afford my bills (barely) but we have food and a roof over our head. But even before he was born I have had depression. I'm sure his mom cheating on me and leaving us 4 years ago didn't help. ( Not doctor diagnosed but I assume do to always been looking at things as glass being empty and not wanting to live.) Now as I'm getting older I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life. Of course I will wait till he's an adult but I just can't seem to get my life together. Every job I have ever wanted I can't get because my experience is in different fields. Females don't like me because of the dad bod. I feel I'm at the point of just no success. I'm over being a failure. But I don't have motivation. I have tried but i just feel like a waste of space. This thing called a life is too much. I would say I'm suicidal but I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that. 11 more years then yes I could be there but for now he just has a non successful dad that he is probably ashamed of. How do I deal with the pain of life. I feel like I'm a failure to my son, my parents, and everyone around me. Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>

    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None. The post explicitly states ""I don't have the balls to actually do it.""
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The intent to ""leave this life"" is present, but explicitly stated as not immediate (""I don't have the balls to actually do it"") and postponed (""Of course I will wait till he's an adult,"" ""11 more years then yes I could be there"").
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to die or for life to end (""not wanting to live,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""I would say I'm suicidal""). The writer is expressing these as his own feelings, not as unwanted intrusive thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I would say I'm suicidal.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""not wanting to live,"" ""more and more comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""leaving this life,"" ""Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. He expresses a desire to die, but states he lacks the courage *now* and is postponing it. He is not expressing these thoughts as unwanted.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Imminence is *not* high; it's explicitly stated as not immediate and postponed for 11 years.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings of despair and suicidal ideation, and a long-term future intention (11 years from now).
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I would say I'm suicidal"") and a clear desire to not be alive (""not wanting to live,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is personal and not stated as unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. The writer explicitly states ""I don't have the balls to actually do it"" and intends to ""wait till he's an adult"" (11 years). This lack of immediate plan/method rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal thoughts and desire without any concrete plan or action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I just want off this life."" This is a clear expression of a desire for life to end.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""struggling to hold on,"" ""depressed and feeling like shit for years & years."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and chronic distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Been depressed and feeling like shit for years & years"" refers to a chronic state, not a past suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire ""I just want off this life"" is current, but no specific timeframe for an *action* is given.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for life to end; it is not presented as an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, ""I just want off this life"" clearly expresses a desire for life to end.
    *   **Explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the desire is stated as a personal feeling.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** No.
    *   **Signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Vague reference to action implying method/plan with high imminence?** No. There is no mention of ""doing something"" or ""making pain physical"" coupled with high imminence.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** The desire (""I just want off this life"") is current. The depression is described as long-term (""for years & years"").
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear personal expression of wanting life to end (""I just want off this life"") and profound despair. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, which would be required for 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past initiated suicidal action, which would be required for 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, as the desire for life to end is clearly stated as a personal feeling, ruling out 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""I need to kill myself"" and ""me killing myself."" No specific method or means is mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""completely failing school,"" ""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore,"" ""life just isn't worth it,"" ""terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends."" These indicate hopelessness, anhedonia, despair, and a sense of burden/guilt.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The question ""how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends"" is a consideration about the *impact* of the act, not a method or plan for carrying it out.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I need to kill myself"" implies a strong present desire/intention, but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire to die (""I need to kill myself,"" ""life just isn't worth it""). The fear of hurting others is a deterrent to acting, but does not negate the underlying desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""I need to kill myself,"" ""me killing myself.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, ""I need to kill myself,"" ""life just isn't worth it.""
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No. The writer expresses a desire to act, tempered by concern for others, but not a negation of the desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act?** No. The post asks *how* to minimize harm to others, not *how* to commit suicide (e.g., by what method).
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context.** While the desire is strong, there is no reference to any action or method, even vague. The question is about the emotional aftermath, not the physical act itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes a current intention (""I need to kill myself"").
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I need to kill myself,"" ""life just isn't worth it""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator' because there is clear personal suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. The question about minimizing harm to family is a consideration *around* the act, not a method or plan *for* the act. This absence of a plan/method/action rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and desire to die without any specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""By this time next week I'll be gone."" This strongly implies ending one's life or disappearing permanently, which in context of despair, points to death by suicide.

    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""By this time next week I'll be gone."" This indicates a specific, near-future timeframe.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""I'll be gone"" coupled with the profound hopelessness and fatigue (""no point in trying anymore,"" ""so tired of fighting"") indicates a clear desire for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" in this context clearly conveys a desire for life to end. ""No point in trying anymore"" and ""tired of fighting this constantly"" reinforce this desire for an end to suffering, implying an end to life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post expresses a desire for an outcome, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. ""I'll be gone"" states an outcome, not a method or plan for achieving it.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While imminence is high (""By this time next week""), there is no ""vague reference to action"" (e.g., ""do something,"" ""make this pain physical"") that implies a method. ""I'll be gone"" is a statement of state/outcome, not an action or method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A future intention (""By this time next week I'll be gone"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire for life to end (""I'll be gone,"" ""no point in trying anymore"") and indicates a timeframe (""By this time next week""). This goes beyond general distress or abstract thoughts, indicating clear suicidal intent. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post contains clear mentions of death (""I hope I don't make it,"" ""I just want to die"") and a direct reference to a past self-harm action (""don't want to survive another attempt""). Emotional indicators include despair and feeling like a burden due to medical bills. There is a clear desire to die. While there isn't a specific plan or method mentioned for a *current* action, the phrase ""another attempt"" directly refers to a past initiated action by the author. The imminence is implied by ""I hope I don't make it,"" but it's framed around the outcome of a past or potential future attempt, rather than a current plan.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT: Yes, ""I just want to die"" and ""I hope I don't make it"" express a clear desire to die. The suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; rather, the desire to die is explicit.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION: No specific plan, method, or preparation for a *current* suicidal act is described. The mention of ""another attempt"" refers to a *past* initiated action, not a current plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT: The post describes a current desire to die (""I just want to die"") in the context of a past initiated action (""another attempt""). The phrase ""don't want to survive another attempt"" explicitly indicates that the author has initiated a potentially lethal action in the past. This fits the definition of 'Attempt' as it describes a ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post clearly describes a past self-initiated suicidal action by the author (""another attempt""). Although there is also current ideation (""I just want to die""), the presence of a clearly described past attempt means 'Attempt' takes precedence according to the provided rules: ""'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""death is the only escape.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""Too far gone,"" ""intense,"" ""no escape from the everlasting flames of life."" Also mentions social anxiety.

    - References to past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""The thoughts are intense and are seemingly only getting more intense as the days pass."" ""I wake immediately with suicidal thoughts swarming my head."" This indicates a current and worsening state of ideation. ""death is the only escape"" implies a current desire for an end.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""death is the only escape"" clearly indicates a desire for life to end. The ""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"" are presented as a personal experience, not explicitly unwanted or resisted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""death is the only escape."" This is a clear expression of desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post does not negate the desire; rather, it reinforces it with ""death is the only escape.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While the thoughts are intense and worsening, there is no mention of any action, plan, or method, even vague. The focus is on the thoughts and the desire for death as an escape, not on *how* to achieve it.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, ongoing, and intensifying state of suicidal thoughts and a current belief that death is the only escape.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts"" (""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"") and ""a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end"" (""death is the only escape""). This fits the 'Ideation' definition.
    - It does not explicitly state that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted; in fact, ""death is the only escape"" suggests alignment with the thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods/means:** The post directly asks ""What constitutes a suicide attempt?"". It discusses ""vaguely suicidal stuff,"" ""testing my method,"" ""point of no return,"" and explicitly states ""I went in with the intention of dying."" It refers to an unnamed ""method.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""struggle to not think about,"" ""genuinely bothered me afterwards,"" ""struggle to categorize,"" ""weighing on me a little bit,"" ""bothering me."" These indicate current distress related to past events.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A ""method"" is implied and used in past actions. The actions involved going ""until shortly before the point of no return.""
    *   **References to past actions:** The entire post revolves around two specific past events: ""only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened."" For the first event: ""I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped."" For the second: ""I went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself."" These are clear descriptions of self-initiated actions.
    *   **Imminence:** The described actions are in the past (""past year or two,"" ""long enough ago""). The author states they are ""in a tenuously better situation right now."" There is no current or future suicidal intent expressed, only a struggle with the past actions.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** For the second event, the desire was explicit: ""I went in with the intention of dying."" For the first, it was ""testing my method"" by going to the ""point of no return,"" indicating a willingness to potentially die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide attempt,"" ""vaguely suicidal stuff.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, for the second event: ""I went in with the intention of dying.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post describes past actions where the desire was present, and the current struggle is about the *nature* of those past actions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? A ""method"" is clearly implied and was used. The actions involved going ""until shortly before the point of no return,"" indicating a concrete action with a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the ""testing"" implies some prior thought or setup.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. This post describes *past initiated actions* with intent.

    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past events (""past year or two,"" ""long enough ago""). The current state is ""tenuously better,"" and the current struggle is categorizing these past events.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes.
        *   First event: ""I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped."" This is an initiated action, even if self-interrupted.
        *   Second event: ""I went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself."" This explicitly states intent to die and describes initiating an action that was self-interrupted.
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' includes actions ""even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" Both described events fit this. The historical nature does not negate it being an 'Attempt' if the author brings it up in the context of their current feelings.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent (""intention of dying"") and describes past *actions* taken, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Not Ideation:** The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires; it describes *initiated actions* (""I went until shortly before the point of no return,"" ""I went in with the intention of dying... I stopped myself"").
    *   **Not Behavior:** 'Behavior' refers to *current or future* plans/intended actions. This post describes *past initiated actions*. While these past actions were behaviors, the 'Attempt' category specifically covers past initiated actions that were potentially lethal.
    *   **Attempt:** The post clearly describes past, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal. For the second event, the author explicitly states ""I went in with the intention of dying"" and then ""stopped myself."" This perfectly fits the definition of an attempt that was self-interrupted. The first event, ""testing my method"" by going ""until shortly before the point of no return,"" also describes a very high-risk initiated action. The post is fundamentally about these past actions and their classification.

270,"Why exactly should I even have hope anymore? Its evident from my entire life up until now that I was never meant to be happy. I have to learn to not get my hopes up or get excited over shit. Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I really want to die."" ""I'd rather die than submit to anyone."" ""So what do I have to live for?"" (implying a desire not to live). No mention of specific methods, tools, or means for suicide. ""I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions"" is a desire for emotional numbness, not a direct suicidal statement.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""never meant to be happy,"" ""nothing ever gets better,"" ""will never achieve my goals""), despair, self-loathing (""I am the one ruining my own life,"" ""I probably deserve to suffer""), resentment, loneliness, feelings of betrayal, worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquiring means.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions past bullying, parental abuse, past attempts to ""try"" (in life, not suicidal attempts), past bullying of others. These are contextual for the current state, not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire ""I really want to die"" is stated as a current, strong feeling. No specific timeframe for *acting* on it (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit personal desire to die (""I really want to die""). The thoughts are not presented as unwanted or intrusive.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases, but ""I really want to die"" is a direct and explicit expression of suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I really want to die,"" ""I'd rather die than submit to anyone,"" ""So what do I have to live for?"" all indicate a clear desire for life to end or not to be alive.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a personal wish, not an unwanted thought.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a vague reference to action implying a method/plan with high imminence? No. The desire to die is strong, but there's no indication of *how* or *when* they might act on it, even vaguely.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current strong suicidal ideation and feelings, rooted in past experiences.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. There is no mention of a past suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""I really want to die,"" ""I'd rather die""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is clear and personal, not abstract or explicitly unwanted.
    *   The post does *not* mention any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'. While the desire is intense, the *how* or *when* of acting on it is completely absent.
    *   The post does *not* describe any past self-initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the post clearly fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, without any mention of a plan, method, or preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods/means:** ""contemplating suicide,"" ""looking up how to do it,"" ""wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself."" These are explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts, research into methods, and specific methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depression ruined a great life,"" ""fucking hell,"" ""destroys any hope,"" ""never ending pit,"" ""nightmare."" High levels of despair and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""looking up how to do it"" is a form of preparation/research. ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself"" are specific methods being considered. While the author states they lack the courage, the methods are clearly identified as what they *wish* they could do.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""contemplating suicide and looking up how to do it"" suggests ongoing current thoughts and research. The wish for courage to act on specific methods indicates a current desire for action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself so this nightmare could all be over."" This clearly expresses a personal desire to die by suicide. It is not expressing distress about *unwanted* thoughts; it's expressing a desire to act on them.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Explicitly mentions ""suicide"": Yes (""contemplating suicide"").
    *   Expresses clear desire to die/for life to end: Yes (""I wish I had the courage to jump... so this nightmare could all be over"").
    *   Explicitly states they *do not* want these thoughts/actions: No, the opposite is true; they wish they *did* have the courage to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Specific method/tool/substance/location mentioned: Yes, ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself"" are specific methods.
    *   Signs of preparation: Yes, ""looking up how to do it"" indicates research into methods, which is a form of preparation.
    *   Even with ""wish I had the courage,"" the presence of specific methods and research into ""how to do it"" indicates elements of a plan or intended action, even if currently inhibited by lack of courage.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Describes current contemplation, research, and desire for future action.
    *   Does not describe a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""contemplating suicide,"" ""wish I had the courage... so this nightmare could all be over""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because it includes specific methods (""jump in front of a car,"" ""stab myself"") and a form of preparation/research (""looking up how to do it""). This moves it into 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The combination of explicit suicidal desire/thoughts *with* specific methods being considered and research into ""how to do it"" fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The stated lack of courage does not negate the presence of these behavioral elements.

While the nuclear bomb is a wish for collective death, it strongly indicates a desire for life to end, including their own. ""Rest In Peace"" directly refers to death.

These show extreme hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, self-blame, and anger.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation for personal suicide is mentioned. The nuclear bomb is a wish for an external, collective event, not a personal suicide plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past self-harm or suicide attempts are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** The desire is current and strong (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad""), but no immediate timeframe for action is stated, nor any implied action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and strong personal desire for life to end and to not exist (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back""). The wish for collective death reinforces this desire for non-existence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly ""kill myself"" for the author, but ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" and ""I want to leave and never come back"" are strong expressions of wanting to die or cease to exist. The wish for a nuclear bomb to ""kill us all"" further reinforces this desire for an end to life.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back"" are direct expressions of this.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as a personal, current feeling.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The nuclear bomb is a wish for a global event, not a personal method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. No such vague reference to personal action is present. The desire is strong, but there's no hint of *how* the author intends to act on it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current strong feelings and a current desire for life to end.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound distress and a clear, strong personal desire to die or cease to exist (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for *personal* suicide. The wish for a nuclear bomb is a desire for collective death, not a personal suicide plan. This means it doesn't fit 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of a desire for life to end, without any specific plan or action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""It will all be done after I die,"" ""I want to die.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""so much pressure,"" indicating distress and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""pull the trigger"" is a specific method (implies a gun).
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" suggests a current, strong, and potentially imminent intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""I want to die"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to die.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""pull the trigger."" This implies the use of a gun.
    - There are no signs of preparation explicitly mentioned, but the specific method with high imminence is sufficient.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""I'm just going to pull the trigger"").
    - It does not describe a past, specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of desire to die (""I want to die""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by mentioning a specific method (""pull the trigger"") and a stated intention to act (""I'm just going to pull the trigger""). This distinguishes it from 'Ideation'.
    - It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The combination of explicit suicidal intent and a specific method/intended action falls directly under the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I hurt myself two months ago"" (self-harm). ""my forearms with my wounds are visible"" (current/recent self-harm). ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" (explicit mention of death as a solution/escape).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""I hurt myself,"" ""tired of putting a mask on,"" ""sleeping is really hard and I'm tired all the time,"" ""pain."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, feeling isolated, and exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I hurt myself two months ago"" - this is a past self-harm action. The timeframe is specified.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire for death (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"") is a current feeling, but no immediate imminence for a suicidal act is stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" expresses a clear desire for life to end or for an escape that death would provide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" strongly indicates a desire for life to end as a means of escape.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire for death is presented as a personal solution.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   There is no plan, method, or preparation for suicide mentioned. The desire for death is present, but no ""how"" or ""when"" for a suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""I hurt myself two months ago""), a current state (""my forearms with my wounds are visible,"" ""tired of putting a mask on""), and a current desire/feeling about the future (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? ""I hurt myself two months ago"" describes a past self-harm action. While self-harm can be potentially lethal, the post does *not* explicitly state that this action was an *attempt to die* (i.e., a suicide attempt). It states ""I hurt myself,"" which is self-harm. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a clear description of an *initiated action with suicidal intent* (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself,"" ""I took pills""). Since the intent of the past self-harm is not explicitly stated as suicidal, it doesn't definitively meet the 'Attempt' criteria based on the provided examples and strict interpretation of intent. The current desire for death is distinct from the past self-harm action's stated intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** No, because there is a clear, personal expression of a desire for death (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""), which goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Attempt:** While self-harm is mentioned, the post does not explicitly state that the past self-harm (""I hurt myself"") was an *attempt to die*. The definition of 'Attempt' focuses on initiated actions that were *suicidal* in nature (e.g., ""tried to hang myself,"" ""overdosed""). The current desire for death is present, but the past action is not framed as a suicide attempt. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not the best fit.
    *   **Behavior:** No, because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or intended action for suicide.
    *   **Ideation:** Yes, because the post contains a clear, personal expression of wanting life to end or finding solace in death (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end... without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned."" The past self-harm is a significant risk factor and context, but the *current suicidal intent* expressed aligns with Ideation.

Final decision is Ideation due to the clear expression of desire for death without a stated plan/method, and the past self-harm not being explicitly framed as a suicide attempt.

I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that.

At the same time, this is so much to carry alone, it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone. It's too much. I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal I get,"" ""detailed plans in my journal"" (related to suicide), ""conversations with myself about suicide,"" ""think about suicide every day,"" and ""seriously consider it.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""want help and to get better,"" ""can't tell anyone,"" ""feel so alone,"" ""sad all the time,"" ""worried I would go to hell,"" ""can't afford that,"" ""expenses... make me twice as suicidal,"" ""so much to carry alone,"" ""too much."" These indicate distress, loneliness, hopelessness, and fear of consequences.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I write detailed plans in my journal."" This indicates the existence of plans.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal *actions* (attempts) are mentioned. The ""seven years"" refers to the duration of the struggle.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** Thoughts are daily, serious consideration ""once a week or so."" The plans are written regularly.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** This is crucial. The writer states: ""More than anything I want help and to get better,"" and most importantly, ""But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did."" This explicitly negates the desire to act on the suicidal thoughts, despite having them and writing plans. The primary desire is for help and recovery, not death.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal,"" ""suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The post explicitly states, ""But I know I would never do it."" The desire is to ""get help and to get better.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did."" This is a clear statement that they do not intend to act on the thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method/tool/location is mentioned, only ""detailed plans.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I write detailed plans in my journal"" is a form of planning/preparation. However, the context is that these plans are written as part of the internal struggle, not as active steps towards an intended action, given the explicit negation of intent to act. The plans are *had* and *written*, but not *intended to be executed*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current ongoing thoughts, the act of writing plans, and a long-standing internal struggle.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The presence of ""suicidal"" thoughts and ""detailed plans"" might initially suggest 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the crucial element is the explicit negation of intent to act: ""But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did."" This statement directly aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The writer is distressed *by* the thoughts and the burden of carrying them, and desires help, but does not express a personal desire to die or to act on the plans. The plans are part of the internal struggle and processing, not active preparation for an intended suicide.
    *   'Ideation' requires a ""clear personal expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end."" This is explicitly negated.
    *   'Behavior' requires ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (as in 'Ideation') AND also mentions... a plan... or preparations."" Since the desire to die/act is negated, it does not meet the full criteria for Behavior where the plan is linked to a current intent to execute.
    *   'Attempt' is clearly not applicable as no past initiated action is described.
    *   Therefore, the primary message is one of distress over unwanted suicidal thoughts and the inability to seek help, fitting the 'Indicator' category.

276,:(. I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""The pain is unreal."" These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and an inability to cope.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""I can't take it anymore"" implies an immediate feeling of being overwhelmed, but not an imminent suicidal action.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses profound pain and an inability to endure it, which is a strong indicator of distress, but does not explicitly state a desire to die or for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No, not explicitly. While ""I can't take it anymore"" suggests a desire for the pain to stop, it doesn't explicitly state a desire for death or to end life. It's a statement of profound suffering.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of distress.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness (""I can't take it anymore. The pain is unreal."").
    - It lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or explicit suicidal intent from the author. Phrases like ""I hate living"" or ""I want to die"" are absent.
    - There is no mention of specific plans, methods, or past actions.
    - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress without explicit suicidal ideation.

277,"Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""commiting suicide"".
    - Emotional indicators: The phrase ""Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action"" conveys a dark, sarcastic, and despairing sentiment, indicating a profound sense of hopelessness and a perceived readiness to act on suicidal thoughts.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. ""Sober"" refers to the individual's state, not a method.
    - References to past actions: No past actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober"" indicates a current perceived capability and readiness, implying a future intention, but without a specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""now.""
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire/intent to commit suicide, expressed as a newfound capability. It is not about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""commiting suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the statement ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober"" expresses a clear personal intent and readiness to die by suicide.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement implies a willingness and capability to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While there is clear intent and perceived capability, there is no *vague reference to an action* that implies a method (e.g., ""do something drastic,"" ""end it all tonight"" without further context). The phrase ""capable of commiting suicide sober"" describes a state of readiness, not a method or plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current perceived capability and implied future intention.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire and perceived capability to commit suicide (""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or intended action (e.g., no mention of pills, a gun, a location, or writing a note). The statement is about a state of being (""capable of commiting suicide sober"") rather than the *how* or *what* of an action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - The post aligns with 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to act, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for carrying it out.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or specific methods. However, ""I just want it to be over"" and ""I wasn't to be down"" (likely meaning ""I want to be done"" or ""I want to be gone"") strongly imply a desire for life to end.
    - Emotional indicators: ""drunk because I'm a piece of shit,"" ""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I don't want to be alone any more,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" ""I'm sick and tired,"" ""Please please please."" These indicate extreme despair, self-loathing, hopelessness, and a plea for relief.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: The language (""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I just want it to be over"") conveys immediate and intense distress, implying a current desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear wish for life to end (""I just want it to be over,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" ""I wasn't to be down""). They are expressing a desire for an end to their existence/suffering, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""I just want it to be over,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" and ""I wasn't to be down"" (interpreted as wanting to be gone/done/dead) clearly express a desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is personal and strong, not negated.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: No, there is no reference to an action, only a desire for an outcome (""over,"" ""down"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current desire/intention.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses profound emotional pain, self-loathing, and a direct desire for life to end (""I hate every part of my life,"" ""I just want it to be over,"" ""I wasn't to be down""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end.""
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - The expressions are clearly a personal desire for an end to life/suffering, not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts, thus it's not 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" and ""I will use my suicide"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""I hate capitalism and everyone complicit in it."" (Indicates anger, resentment, and strong negative feelings).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) or preparation (e.g., writing note) is mentioned for the future intent. The phrase ""I will use my suicide"" states an intent but not a 'how'.
    - References to past actions: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" This is a clear statement of past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""I will use my suicide"" indicates a future intention, but no immediate timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""soon.""
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a clear desire to die (""I will use my suicide"") linked to a purpose.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""attempted suicide,"" ""my suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I will use my suicide"" clearly indicates a desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses intent to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, for the future intent.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Imminence is not high. No vague reference to a *method* is present, only the *act* itself.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both.
        - Past event: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" This describes specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions in the past.
        - Current/future intention: ""I will use my suicide to disturb people...""
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes, ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" directly states past initiated actions. This is key for the 'Attempt' category.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear statement of past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - While there is also current ideation/future intent (""I will use my suicide""), the rule states: ""'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.""
    - Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

Managed to find a job, and then get fired 2 months after. Stalked my ex on Instagram for waaay to long which only made me feel more lonely, because she started traveling, made tons of new friends etc. While I found out I have no real friends anymore. The most fucked up thing is I still think about her every day. I've been in 2 short relationships since, but still, my mind won't let me forget her. Tried to kill myself 3 times by now. I've just given up completely. I just want the pain to end. I don't recognise myself any more",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This is a direct mention of past suicidal actions. ""I just want the pain to end."" implies a desire for cessation of life/suffering.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""bottom of hell,"" ""bad break up that really messed me up,"" ""fell into depression,"" ""flunked college,"" ""fired,"" ""feel more lonely,"" ""no real friends anymore,"" ""most fucked up thing,"" ""given up completely,"" ""don't recognise myself any more."" These indicate extreme despair, hopelessness, anhedonia, and a sense of being a burden/failure.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No current specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a *future* act.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This is a clear statement of past self-initiated suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire for pain to end is current, but no immediate *action* is stated. The ""tried to kill myself"" refers to past events.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I just want the pain to end."" This indicates a desire for suffering to cease, implying a desire for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""Tried to kill myself"" explicitly mentions suicide.
    *   Yes, ""I just want the pain to end"" expresses a clear desire for life to end to stop suffering.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No current plan, method, or preparation for a *future* suicidal act is mentioned. The mention of ""tried to kill myself 3 times"" refers to *past* actions, not current planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes past events (""bad break up 2 years ago,"" ""flunked college,"" ""fired"").
    *   It explicitly describes *past, specific, potentially lethal actions* initiated by the author: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This directly fits the definition of an 'Attempt'. The fact that it's a past action does not preclude it from being classified as 'Attempt' if the author describes it.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong current ideation (""I just want the pain to end"") and describes a history of despair and failure.
    *   However, the most definitive element is the explicit statement: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This directly describes past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions.
    *   According to the guidelines: ""Attempt: The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    *   Furthermore, the rule states: ""**'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author**, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.""
    *   Therefore, despite the current ideation, the explicit mention of past attempts makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate classification.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""how to accomplish death"" - direct mention of seeking a way to die.
        *   ""I don't want my head to explode via shotgun"" - specific method (shotgun) mentioned and considered, then rejected due to perceived outcome.
        *   ""But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth."" - highly specific method (handgun, shooting through upper palate in mouth) mentioned, along with detailed consideration of caliber. This is a clear discussion of a *method*.
        *   ""I've looked into other options"" - implies research into various methods.
        *   ""A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate."" - discusses fear of failed suicide and its consequences, implying a desire for a successful one.
        *   ""End it now"" - a direct statement urging self or others to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""in hell,"" ""so alone,"" ""insane abandonment issues,"" ""painful feeling of inability to connect,"" ""sadder,"" ""terribly scared,"" ""pain,"" ""depression,"" ""high anxiety."" These indicate severe distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** The detailed discussion of shotgun and handgun methods, including the specific anatomical target (""upper palate in my mouth""), and the statement ""I've looked into other options,"" strongly indicate active contemplation and research of *methods* for suicide. This goes beyond mere thoughts into the realm of planning/means.
    *   **References to past actions:** None by the author. The mention of Mark Linkous's overdose is an external example, not the author's own past attempt.
    *   **Imminence:** ""End it now"" suggests high imminence and a desire for immediate action. ""I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"" indicates a desire to die coupled with a fear of the *process* or *failure* of death, not a lack of desire to die.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die (""how to accomplish death,"" ""End it now"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""how to accomplish death,"" ""shooting myself,"" ""failed suicide.""
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, ""I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death,"" ""End it now.""
    *   **Explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the fear is about the *difficulty* or *failure* of the act, not about the desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** Yes. The user discusses specific methods (shotgun, handgun) and even a specific target (""upper palate in my mouth""). They also state they've ""looked into other options,"" indicating research into methods. This is a clear indication of contemplating and researching *how* to die.
    *   **Signs of preparation?** While not explicitly acquiring means, the detailed consideration of methods and research into ""other options"" is a strong form of planning and method identification.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context.** The high imminence (""End it now"") combined with the detailed discussion of specific methods (shotgun, handgun, specific shot location) clearly points to a plan/method being actively considered.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** Primarily current/future intention (""how to accomplish death,"" ""End it now"").
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No. The post discusses a past overdose by Mark Linkous, which is an external event, not the author's own initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes far beyond general distress (Indicator) due to explicit suicidal intent and desire to die.
    *   It also goes beyond mere Ideation because it includes detailed discussion and consideration of specific methods for suicide (shotgun, handgun, specific shot location, research into ""other options""). This level of detail about *how* to die, even if expressing fear about the execution or outcome, constitutes planning and method identification.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action by the author, so it is not Attempt.
    *   Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with detailed discussion and consideration of specific methods/plans places it firmly in the 'Behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is a strong euphemism for wanting to die or cease to exist.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Can't do any of it!"" expresses hopelessness and inability to cope. ""Just don't want this anymore"" expresses profound despair and a desire for an end to current suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: The desire is present and current (""just wanna""). No specific timeframe for action is given.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire for life to end/to die, expressed through the euphemism. It is not stated as an unwanted thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" clearly indicates a desire for non-existence or death. ""Just don't want this anymore"" reinforces this desire for an end to their current state.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a personal wish.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. ""Sleep"" is the desired outcome, not a method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: The desire is high, but there is no reference to an *action* or *how* this ""sleep and never wake up"" state would be achieved.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die or cease to exist (""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"") and profound despair (""Can't do any of it! Just don't want this anymore""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    - It does not describe any past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - It goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts; there is a clear, personal desire for death, so it is not 'Indicator'.

    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The desire is current (""I want to die""), but no specific timeframe for action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is given.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and repeated desire to die. The ""but I'm scared"" indicates internal conflict or fear of the act, but does not negate the stated desire to die.

    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. The ""I'm scared"" expresses fear, not a negation of the desire to die. The desire to die is clearly present and personal.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.

    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire to die.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""I want to die"") and profound hopelessness (""What's the point,"" ""tired of everything""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. The phrase ""Can someone please help me work out what to do"" explicitly indicates a lack of a concrete plan and a search for help, which is inconsistent with 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without any described plan, method, or preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""I can't stop thinking about suicide,"" ""end it,"" ""suffer till I end it,"" ""I know where I'll attempt.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I am not ok,"" ""I cry about it,"" ""I am really suffering emotionally,"" ""I feel so hopeless,"" ""I will never be ok,"" ""I will just suffer.""

These are explicit mentions of having a plan and knowing the details of its execution (where, how, what is needed, timing).
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""idk if I should do it and end it"" indicates current consideration. ""I will just suffer till I end it"" indicates a future intention. The mention of ""Tuesday"" provides a specific temporal context for part of the plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for life to end (""end it,"" ""suffer till I end it""). The ""idk if I should do it"" expresses ambivalence about *acting*, but the underlying desire and the presence of a plan are strong.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide,"" ""end it,"" ""attempt.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""end it,"" ""suffer till I end it.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the ambivalence is about *execution*, not about the thoughts themselves being unwanted. The suffering and desire to ""end it"" are strong.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes. ""I have a plan,"" ""I know where I'll attempt,"" ""I know how,"" ""I know what I need."" While the *exact* method (e.g., overdose, jump) isn't named, the explicit statement of having a plan and knowing the ""where,"" ""how,"" and ""what I need"" clearly indicates the presence of a plan and method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I know what I need"" implies preparation. ""I know how and when I can run away from home. It must be a Tuesday to run away"" indicates detailed planning and timing for a component of the overall plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention. ""I have a plan,"" ""I will just suffer till I end it,"" ""I know where I'll attempt.""
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end suffering, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post explicitly states ""I have a plan"" and provides details about knowing ""where I'll attempt,"" ""how,"" and ""what I need."" This goes beyond mere 'Ideation' (thoughts/desire without a plan/method/action). The presence of a concrete, even if vaguely described, plan and knowledge of execution details fits the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit mention of having a plan and knowing the details of its execution (""where,"" ""how,"" ""what I need""), combined with clear suicidal intent, the post falls under 'Behavior'.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out? I want to be done, I want to be out of this and I wish I could just sleep for now but I can't. I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore. Sorry for the total drivel, I'm so angry/down right now and I needed to vent.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""make me want to die""
        *   ""completely done with the world""
        *   ""fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now"" (Indifference to harm, potential recklessness, but not a specific suicidal method)
        *   ""I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over."" (Passive suicidal ideation, desire for an end)
        *   ""I don't want to be here""

        *   ""I'm done.""
        *   ""I want to be done, I want to be out of this""
        *   ""I want to disappear.""
        *   ""I do not want to exist anymore.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** angry, upset, completely done, crying, guilty, pissed, down, hopeless (""can't see a solution or a way out"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None explicitly mentioned. The ""wandering off into the night"" is vague regarding a specific suicidal *method*; it's more about indifference to harm or a desire for something bad to happen, rather than an active plan to end their life by a specific means.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** High imminence (""right now,"" ""3am,"" current feelings).
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear, strong desire to die, not exist, or for life to end. The thoughts are not presented as unwanted; they align with the expressed desire for an end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, multiple times: ""want to die,"" ""done with the world,"" ""don't want to be here,"" ""want to not exist,"" ""I'm done,"" ""want to be done, I want to be out of this,"" ""want to disappear,"" ""do not want to exist anymore."" These are clear expressions of a desire for life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present and aligns with the thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The phrase ""fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now"" indicates recklessness or indifference to harm, but it does not specify a *method* for suicide (e.g., ""I'm going to wander into traffic"" or ""I'm going to jump from X""). It's too vague to be considered a plan or method for self-harm.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While imminence and intent are high, the ""wandering off"" part is not a *specific suicidal action* or *method*. It's more about passive hope for an end or indifference to danger, rather than an active plan to cause one's own death by a defined means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current feelings and future intentions/desires (""want to die,"" ""want to disappear"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains very clear and strong personal expressions of a desire to die/not exist (""want to die,"" ""want to not exist,"" ""I'm done,"" ""do not want to exist anymore""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is explicit and personal, not abstract or unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The ""wandering off"" part, while indicating distress and indifference to harm, does not constitute a specific suicidal *method* or *plan*. It's a general statement about not caring what happens, not a detailed intention to act in a specific way to end life.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.

    Therefore, the post clearly falls under 'Ideation' due to the strong, explicit, and current expressions of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without any specific plan or method.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""ideations of suicide."" It also states, ""Everyday I'm battling to stay alive"" and ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive."" These are clear expressions of a desire for life to end or to not be alive. The phrase ""people/the world would be better off without me"" indicates feelings of being a burden.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of everything,"" ""severely depressed,"" ""shame,"" ""alone,"" ""painful,"" ""can't imagine a future.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The author states they don't tell their therapist about their ""ideations"" due to fear of police intervention, which further emphasizes that these are thoughts, not actions or plans.
    *   **References to past actions:** The post mentions ""past decisions/mistakes"" and ""past behavior"" but not past suicidal *actions* or *attempts*.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire to not be alive is current and ongoing (""Everyday I'm battling,"" ""Most days I wish"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to not be alive (""Most days I wish I wasn't alive""). The ""ideations of suicide"" are described as a source of ""comfort,"" not as unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""ideations of suicide"" and ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die/not be alive.
    *   No, the writer does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. In fact, they find ""comfort"" in the ideations.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied for a suicidal act.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no vague reference to action coupled with high imminence. The post focuses on the *thoughts* and *desire*, not on any intended action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings, ongoing ""ideations,"" and a current desire to not be alive.
    *   It does not describe any past, specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""ideations of suicide"") and a strong desire to not be alive (""Most days I wish I wasn't alive,"" ""battling to stay alive""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. The fear of police being called for ""ideations"" reinforces that these are thoughts, not actions.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die, without any specific plan, method, or preparation.

    - Stated desire: The post explicitly states ""thinking about killing myself,"" which is a clear personal expression of suicidal ideation. The condition ""If I had just one friend I wouldn't be thinking about killing myself"" clarifies the *reason* for the thoughts, but does not negate the presence of the thoughts themselves. The phrase ""I can't take this anymore"" reinforces the desire for the current suffering to end, implying a desire to not be alive in this state.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for the current painful situation to end, which is linked to the suicidal thoughts (""I can't take this anymore"" in conjunction with ""thinking about killing myself"").

    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The phrase ""I want the constant anxiety and sadness... to stop by crashing into another car"" and ""I'm afraid that I won't die on impact"" clearly indicates a desire for death as a means to end suffering.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""constant anxiety and sadness,"" ""pointless situation."" These indicate despair and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** ""crashing into another car"" is a specific method. ""frequently come close to doing it"" indicates repeated engagement with the idea of enacting the plan, or near-actions.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""frequently come close to doing it but never can"" describes repeated intentions or near-actions, not completed actions.
    *   **Imminence:** ""frequently come close to doing it"" suggests ongoing, high imminence of the intention to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die to stop the pain, as evidenced by wanting to ""stop by crashing into another car"" and the fear of ""won't die on impact"" (implying the desire *is* to die).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the desire to ""stop by crashing into another car"" with the intent to ""die on impact"" is a clear expression of a desire for life to end via a suicidal act.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to act, but is held back by the fear of failure and continued pain, not by a lack of desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""crashing into another car"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""frequently come close to doing it"" implies repeated active consideration and near-execution of the plan, which can be seen as a form of engagement with the method, even if not explicit preparation like writing a note.
    *   Given the explicit desire to die and high imminence (""frequently come close""), the specific method (""crashing into another car"") is clearly identified.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current/future intentions (""I want... to stop by crashing,"" ""frequently come close to doing it"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, the post explicitly states ""never can"" do it, indicating the action has not been initiated or completed. ""frequently come close to doing it"" describes repeated intentions or near-actions, not an initiated attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it expresses a clear personal desire to die to end suffering.
    *   It goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) because it specifies a method (""crashing into another car"") and indicates repeated engagement with the idea of acting on this method (""frequently come close to doing it""). This combination of desire, specific method, and repeated near-action fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   It is not an 'Attempt' because the post explicitly states the action has ""never can"" been completed, only that the author ""frequently come close to doing it.""
    *   Therefore, the presence of a clear desire to die, a specific method, and repeated near-actions points to 'Behavior'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement is a declaration of intent, not a struggle against unwanted thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Is there a vague reference to action implying a method/plan given high imminence? The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" indicates resolve but lacks any detail about *how* the action would be carried out. It does not imply a method or plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""I'm going to kill myself"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, explicit personal expression of suicidal intent (""I'm going to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator' as there is a clear personal desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out the suicide. The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" expresses resolve and timing uncertainty, but not a concrete plan.
    - Since there is clear ideation (""I'm going to kill myself"") but no specific plan, method, or preparation, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - It does not fit 'Behavior' because there is no explicit plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
    - It does not fit 'Attempt' because no past initiated action is described.

    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The user states ""I won't commit,"" which explicitly negates the desire to *act* on any suicidal thoughts. While they don't say ""I don't want these thoughts,"" they clearly state they ""won't commit,"" indicating a lack of personal desire to *act* on any suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No. The user refers to an ""accident,"" which is not a self-initiated method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current thought process (""Does thinking death is an option..."").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses the *concept* of death as an option and questions if this *thought* is suicidal.
    *   Crucially, the author explicitly states ""I won't commit."" This directly negates any active suicidal intent or desire to *cause* their own death.
    *   The desire for death is framed as a passive acceptance of an accidental death, not an active pursuit of suicide.
    *   According to the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.** It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die').""
    *   The statement ""I won't commit"" aligns with the ""not representing a current personal desire to die"" part of the Indicator definition, despite the mention of ""suicidal thought."" The post is more about the nature of the thought itself and a passive acceptance of death, rather than an active desire to die by suicide. It lacks the clear personal expression of suicidal desire required for 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill me,"" ""last chance I have to finally kill me.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I ran out of time,"" ""wish i didnt have to do this"" (expresses reluctance but not a negation of intent).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Its been a year since i planned this,"" ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything."" This clearly indicates a plan and preparations, even if the specific method isn't named.
    - References to past actions: ""Its been a year since i planned this"" refers to past *planning*, not a past *initiated action*.
    - Imminence: ""Tonight is the last chance,"" ""wont lose the oportunity."" This indicates very high, immediate imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""finally kill me,"" ""wont lose the oportunity,"" ""im doing the right after all"" - clear desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill me"" and expresses a clear desire to die.
    - The writer does not explicitly state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them; the ""wish i didnt have to do this"" is an expression of regret, not a negation of intent, which is affirmed by ""but im doing the right after all.""

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - While a specific method isn't named, the post clearly states ""planned this"" and ""have the stuff prepared and everything."" These are direct mentions of a plan and preparations. This is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""Tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me"").
    - It does not describe a past *initiated* potentially lethal action by the author. It describes past *planning* and current *preparation* for a future act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal intent (""kill me""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by explicitly stating ""planned this"" for a year and ""have the stuff prepared and everything,"" coupled with high imminence (""Tonight is the last chance""). This indicates a concrete plan and preparations, moving it beyond 'Ideation'.
    - The post describes future intent and current preparation, not a past initiated action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The presence of explicit suicidal intent, a stated plan, and preparations firmly places this in the 'Behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""starve myself"", ""my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""Idk"", ""I hate my body"", ""I see no reason to fuel it with energy"". Clear self-loathing, despair, and desire for life to end.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""decided to stop eating all together and starve myself"". This is a specific method/plan.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I've decided to stop eating all together"" implies an immediate or ongoing initiation of the plan. ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"" indicates the desired outcome of this current decision.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrase ""I'm to much of a pussy to kill myself"" might seem like a negation, but it's immediately followed by an alternative, specific, and potentially lethal plan (""decided to stop eating all together and starve myself I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends""). This indicates a clear desire for life to end through a self-initiated action, not a negation of suicidal intent, but a chosen method.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""kill myself"" is mentioned, and more importantly, a clear desire to die and for life to end is expressed through the action of starvation (""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"").
    - The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions. Instead, they state a specific, alternative action to achieve the desired outcome of death.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""stop eating all together and starve myself"".
    - Yes, there's a sign of preparation/initiation: ""I've decided to stop eating all together"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current decision and an intended future action: ""I've decided to stop eating all together and starve myself"".
    - It does not describe a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire for life to end (""this just ends"") and suicidal intent through a chosen method. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - It clearly states a specific plan/method (""decided to stop eating all together and starve myself""). This rules out 'Ideation' because a method is present.
    - It describes a current decision and intended action, not a past initiated attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category as it involves explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific plan/method/intended action. The initial statement about being ""too much of a pussy to kill myself"" is a nuance about *how* they intend to die, not a negation of the intent to die itself, which is immediately clarified by the subsequent plan.

293,"Here's the deal. I'm not ok. I haven't been ok for a very long time. Some days are better than others, but for the most part, my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart with a center warm to the touch. In my past I've had everything that made me who I am stripped away from my character time and time again. It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do. Life on this planet is never easy, and there will always be people who've had it worse than me and made it out alive. But for now, in this moment as I write this, all I feel is that somber loneliness I've come to befriend over the last few months, but I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states, ""I don't always wish to be gone."" This implies that sometimes the author *does* wish to be gone, which is a vague reference to not wanting to be alive. However, it's immediately qualified by ""don't always,"" suggesting it's not a constant or dominant desire. No other direct mentions of suicide, death, or self-harm, nor any methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""not ok,"" ""cold, broken heart,"" ""dragged my face through the muds of life,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness."" These clearly indicate significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and loneliness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** Describes past traumatic experiences (""stripped away from my character,"" ""dragged my face through the muds of life,"" ""seeing and experiencing some of the worst things""). No mention of past *suicidal* actions or attempts.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No stated intentions to act.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is key. It indicates a fluctuation in desire, not a clear, consistent, or strong current desire to die. The author also states, ""I know how precious that is [life],"" and ends with ""I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️,"" which conveys a desire for connection and an underlying hope. The primary sentiment is profound distress and loneliness, rather than a clear desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is ambiguous. While it implies a desire to be gone *at times*, it's phrased as a negation of a constant desire. It's not a clear, strong, and current statement of wanting to die. The overall context emphasizes distress, confusion, and loneliness, not a direct intent to end life.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** The ""don't always wish to be gone"" acts as a partial negation of a constant desire to die, leaning towards the ""unwanted thoughts"" side, or at least a fluctuating, non-dominant desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings (""in this moment as I write this, all I feel is that somber loneliness"").
    *   It refers to past difficult life experiences, but not past *suicidal actions*.
    *   No specific, potentially lethal action was initiated.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, confusion, and loneliness.
    *   It *lacks* a clear, current, personal, and explicit expression of suicidal intent or a strong desire to die. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is the closest, but it's qualified and doesn't represent a firm, current desire to end life. The author expresses awareness of life's preciousness and a desire for connection.
    *   There are no mentions of specific suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to end it all"") that are not negated or qualified.
    *   There is no plan, method, intended action, or preparation mentioned.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and emotional pain without a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""suicidal."" It also mentions ""my death will cause"" pain, indicating contemplation of death. Phrases like ""permanently fucked up this life"" and ""destroyed myself"" indicate self-harm/destruction in a metaphorical sense, referring to their mental state.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depressed constantly,"" ""lonely,"" ""barely even have the strength to go to school,"" ""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?"", ""feel worse knowing I'm hurting to delay the pain,"" ""pathetic,"" ""broken."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, and feeling like a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparations (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""destroyed myself"" is a general statement about their life state, not a specific past suicidal action. No past attempts are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** There is no specific indication of immediate intent (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). The questioning ""Why push on"" suggests a lack of future orientation but not an immediate plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer states they are ""suicidal"" and questions ""Why push on,"" which clearly indicates a personal desire for life to end or a strong contemplation of suicide. They wish they ""could restart on life"" and ""wasn't so broken,"" implying a desire to escape their current painful existence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end or not to be alive (""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?"", ""wish I could restart on life"").
    *   No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted. They are presented as their current state and a reason for their despair.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no high imminence coupled with vague action to suggest a 'Behavior' classification.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and intentions (""I'm depressed constantly, suicidal"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts (""suicidal"") and a desire for life to end (""Why push on,"" ""wish I could restart""). This moves it beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end, without any specific plan, method, or preparation.

295,"Work is killing me but I can't quit. Suicide becoming more enticing. Tl;Dr: Working retail has destroyed my body but can't stop working or family will lift a fuss. Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""take my own life,"" and ""end myself."" Also, ""head out before it gets worse"" in the context of these thoughts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Work is killing me,"" ""destroyed my body,"" ""nothing is happening,"" ""sick of it,"" ""stagnant,"" ""pathetic,"" ""body is destroyed constantly."" These show profound hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), location (e.g., bridge), or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Head out"" is too vague to be a specific method or plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life"" indicates uncertainty about timing, not high imminence. ""Suicide becoming more enticing"" suggests increasing consideration.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to die or for life to end. The thoughts are described as ""enticing"" and something they are actively considering, not as unwanted.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""take my own life,"" and ""end myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/for life to end (""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""best to end myself,"" ""probably best I head out"").
    *   No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted. They are presented as a serious consideration.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   Imminence is not high enough to infer a vague method from general statements like ""head out."" The lack of specific detail about *how* to ""take my own life"" or ""end myself"" is key here.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and future considerations/intentions (""I don't know if or when I will take my own life,"" ""Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""take my own life,"" ""end myself""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is clear and personal, not abstract or unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. The phrases like ""head out"" are too vague to constitute a plan or method.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

This is a highly specific method and detailed preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I just slit my wrists."" This is a direct statement of a completed action. ""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it."" This explicitly states the action was completed *before* the post was made.

    *   Crucially, the post states ""I just slit my wrists,"" indicating the action has *already been initiated and completed* at the time of posting.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a *past event* that has just occurred: ""I just slit my wrists."" The phrase ""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it"" confirms the action was completed *before* the post was published.
    *   It describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was *initiated* by the author. This perfectly fits the definition of an 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The defining element of this post is the clear statement ""I just slit my wrists,"" which describes a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that has already taken place. This directly aligns with the 'Attempt' category definition: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... A concrete, potentially life-threatening action by the author must have been *initiated*."" While there is strong ideation and a detailed plan/method, the fact that the action is stated as having *already occurred* makes it an 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The author explicitly states, ""I'm suicidal myself."" This is a direct personal admission of suicidal ideation. They also state, ""I don't want to keep going myself,"" which is a clear expression of a desire for life to end.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author expresses internal conflict and distress (""starting to find it hard to keep that from him,"" ""feeling that it's wrong,"" ""wasn't buying what I was selling"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** There are no mentions of any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, gun, bridge), tools, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
    *   **References to past actions:** No references to past self-initiated suicidal actions by the author. The mention of ""when I started trying to convince him to keep going"" refers to their efforts to help their friend, not a past action related to their own suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Imminence:** The phrases ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself"" indicate a current state of mind, but no specific imminence for an action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer's stated desire is clearly to not continue living (""I don't want to keep going myself"") and they identify as ""suicidal."" This is a genuine wish for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I'm suicidal myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I don't want to keep going myself.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the author expresses these thoughts as their own current state and desire, not as unwanted intrusions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a high imminence coupled with vague action? No specific action or high imminence is mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, ongoing state of suicidal ideation (""I'm suicidal myself,"" ""I don't want to keep going myself"").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end (""I'm suicidal myself,"" ""I don't want to keep going myself""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation' and rules out 'Indicator' because the suicidal intent is personal and explicit, not abstract or explicitly unwanted.

298,If I become worse it's other people's fault. If I become worse and do something bad or kill myself it's everyone else's fault for treating me different. It's not my fault. Everything is thier fault.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""kill myself"" is explicitly used.
    - Emotional indicators: Blame, anger, resentment (""It's other people's fault,"" ""Everything is their fault"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The statement is conditional (""If I become worse... kill myself""), indicating a potential future action rather than immediate intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer states ""kill myself"" as a potential action, attributing blame to others. This indicates a personal expression of suicidal intent, even if conditional. It does not state that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""kill myself"" expresses this desire, albeit conditionally.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer attributes blame for the potential action.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: The imminence is not high due to the conditional nature (""If I become worse""). There is no vague reference to *how* they would act, only the outcome (""kill myself"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a conditional future intention.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""kill myself,"" indicating a clear personal expression of suicidal thoughts/intent. This rules out 'Indicator' because it's a direct expression of suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts/desire (""kill myself"") without any specific plan, method, or preparation.

299,"I've finally mustered up the courage to reach out for some help, but i accidentallty deleted the draft. I think that's a bit too cruel. I don't think i can type it all again.

It really took everything of me to be so vulnerable in such a dark moment, but it's gone. I don't know what to do, i just wanted someone to talk to about how i am desperate that it's impossible to find someone to talk to and how to go on when you can't. I really just feel like breaking, i wanted to die when i made that post but i at least wanted to write out my feelings, it all just feels like meaningless torture right now. I dont want to be made fun of for that, i just don't want to die, but even before and now after that, i have no hope. It seems like an invitation by the universe to make people laugh at me for this and just push me harder. Really i dont know anymore",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states, ""I wanted to die when i made that post"" (referring to a past feeling/thought while drafting) and ""i just don't want to die"" (a current desire *not* to die). No mention of specific methods or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hopelessness,"" ""desperate,"" ""feel like breaking,"" ""meaningless torture,"" ""no hope.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The ""draft"" was for ""reaching out for some help"" and ""writing out my feelings,"" not for a suicidal act.
    *   **References to past actions:** The past action mentioned is drafting a help-seeking message, not a suicidal action. The phrase ""I wanted to die when i made that post"" refers to a past *feeling* or *ideation*, not an initiated *action*.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The current state is ""no hope"" and ""meaningless torture,"" but crucially, ""i just don't want to die."" This indicates a struggle against suicidal thoughts/desire rather than an imminent intent to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states, ""i just don't want to die,"" which negates a current personal desire to die, despite acknowledging past suicidal thoughts and current severe distress and hopelessness.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, it uses ""wanted to die"" and ""don't want to die.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While ""I wanted to die when I made that post"" indicates past ideation, the current, overriding statement is ""i just don't want to die."" This explicitly negates a current desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""i just don't want to die"" clearly indicates the writer does not want to die currently, even though they are experiencing intense hopelessness. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation for a suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past attempt to reach out and past suicidal feelings, and current feelings of profound hopelessness and despair, combined with a current desire *not* to die.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. It describes a past *feeling* (""wanted to die"") and a past *action of writing a draft to seek help*, not a suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and acknowledges past suicidal thoughts (""I wanted to die when I made that post""). However, it critically includes the explicit statement, ""i just don't want to die.""
    *   According to the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The phrase ""i just don't want to die"" fits this criterion directly. The primary sentiment is distress about the situation and the inability to get help, and a stated desire *not* to die, despite the overwhelming despair.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because the current personal desire to die is explicitly negated.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' as there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past initiated suicidal action is described.

Therefore, the post fits the 'Indicator' category due to the explicit negation of a current desire to die, despite the presence of general distress and past suicidal thoughts.

I don't know anyone who has the same interests. I'm ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point"", ""I'm ready to say goodbye"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""feel like shit"", ""pretty much a failure"", ""letting everyone down"", ""broken and lifeless"".
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. There is no indication of *how* the person is trying to kill themselves, no tools, locations, or substances.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""at this point"" indicates a current state of mind. ""Ready to say goodbye"" implies a readiness for action, but this is immediately followed by ""but I'm also not,"" indicating ambivalence.
    - Stated desire: There is a clear stated desire to die (""trying to kill myself""). The ambivalence at the end (""but I'm also not"") doesn't negate the strong preceding statement of intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""trying to kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""trying to kill myself"", ""ready to say goodbye"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point"" is a direct expression of desire/intent, not an unwanted thought. The ""but I'm also not"" indicates ambivalence, not a negation of the underlying desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The post states ""trying to kill myself"" but provides no details on *how*.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While ""trying to kill myself"" implies action, it lacks any ""how"" or specific means, even vague. The ambivalence (""but I'm also not"") also reduces the certainty of immediate action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention/state (""am trying to kill myself at this point"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent and a desire to die (""trying to kill myself"", ""ready to say goodbye""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out the suicidal intent. The statement ""trying to kill myself"" expresses the desire and a general intent to act, but without any details on *how* or any steps being taken. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal thoughts and desire without a concrete plan or action.

301,The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it. My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of. I could do it right now.

It's a neverending cycle. I'm done.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""killing myself,"" ""fear of death,"" ""scared to die,"" ""scared of the emptiness after death,"" and ""hope that I don't wake up."" Mentions parents ""taken any means they can think of,"" implying past access or potential for means, but no *current* specific method is stated by the author.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fear,"" ""hate it,"" ""scared,"" ""cry myself to sleep,"" ""neverending cycle,"" ""I'm done."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, and being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned by the author. The statement ""I could do it right now"" indicates high imminence and a feeling of capability, but it does not describe *how* or *with what*.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past initiated actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I could do it right now"" indicates very high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die or for life to end (""killing myself,"" ""hope that I don't wake up,"" ""I'm done""). The only thing preventing action is fear.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it."" and ""hope that I don't wake up.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present; the *fear* is what's preventing the action, not a lack of desire or the thoughts being unwanted.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The post mentions parents taking ""any means they can think of,"" which implies a *lack* of specific means *currently available to the author* or at least a lack of a stated plan using such means. The author does not state they *have* a method or plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. ""I could do it right now"" expresses imminence and capability but does not provide *any* indication of a method or plan. It's a statement of potential action, not a description of *how* that action would occur.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of intense suicidal ideation and a potential for immediate future action (""I could do it right now"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""killing myself,"" ""I'm done,"" ""hope that I don't wake up""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is personal and explicit, not abstract or explicitly unwanted.
    *   The post states high imminence (""I could do it right now"") and strong intent. However, it *does not* mention any specific plan, method, or preparation. The mention of parents removing means further suggests a lack of a stated plan or method from the author's side. Without any indication of *how* the action would be carried out, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but no concrete plan, method, or preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" ""fear of death,"" ""what happens after I die,"" ""complete blackness.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""afraid of death,"" ""no one would miss me,"" ""nothing to live for,"" ""no point in me being alive,"" ""hate living with my family,"" ""friendships are kinda failing."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, anhedonia.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The desire is current and strong, but no specific timeframe for action is given (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    - Stated desire: There is a clear, explicit wish to die (""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself""). The fear of death is stated as a barrier to action, not a negation of the desire itself.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I want to kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to die,"" ""no point in me being alive.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states they *do* want to die/kill themselves, even if fear is preventing action. The fear of death is a barrier, not a negation of the desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: No specific action or method, vague or otherwise, is mentioned. Imminence is not explicitly high.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current intention/desire.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear, explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is personal and explicit, not abstract or unwanted.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for carrying out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""I'm better off dead."" This is a direct expression of desire for death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Nothing feels right,"" ""broken human being,"" ""My being in itself is a prison,"" ""cause anguish and pain,"" ""Can't stand this anymore."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and feeling like a burden.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I'm better off dead"" is a clear expression of a desire to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'm better off dead.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a personal belief.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Is there a vague reference to action implying a method/plan with high imminence? No, ""Can't stand this anymore"" indicates distress but not an implied action or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current feelings and intentions (""I'm better off dead,"" ""Can't stand this anymore"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of desire to die (""I'm better off dead"") and profound hopelessness/distress. This rules out 'Indicator' as it's more than just general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a direct desire for death.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for carrying out a suicidal act. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""I came extraordinarily close to killing myself."" It also mentions ""my letters were written"" and ""I had a set plan.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** It describes a past state as ""extraordinarily painful"" and ""desperate."" However, the current emotional state is positive and hopeful: ""I made the decision to live,"" ""my situation is no longer as desperate,"" ""The light at the end of the tunnel is almost here.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""my letters were written"" and ""I had a set plan."" These are described as past preparations and a plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** The author refers to past instances of setting a date and living past it, and specifically describes a past instance where they ""came extraordinarily close to killing myself,"" with letters written and a set plan.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The intent described (""days away from going through with"") is explicitly past. The current stated intention is to live.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states, ""I made the decision to live."" They are describing a past suicidal crisis that they have overcome.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" in the context of a past, very serious intent.
    *   The post *currently* expresses a clear desire to live, not to die. However, it describes a *past* clear desire to die.
    *   The writer explicitly states they *do not* want to act on such thoughts *now*, as they have ""made the decision to live.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post clearly describes past preparations (""my letters were written"") and a ""set plan."" It does not describe any *current* plan, method, or preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past event (""I came extraordinarily close,"" ""was days away from going through with"").
    *   It describes a specific, potentially lethal action that was *planned and prepared for* but *not initiated* by the author in the past. The phrase ""days away from going through with"" and ""I keep living past that date"" confirms the action was not initiated. Therefore, it does not meet the definition of 'Attempt' (which requires an *initiated action*).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not 'Indicator':** The described past state goes far beyond general distress and includes explicit suicidal intent with a plan and preparations.
    *   **Not 'Ideation':** The past state described includes a specific plan and preparations (""letters were written,"" ""set plan""), which moves it beyond mere ideation.
    *   **Not 'Attempt':** The crucial distinction for 'Attempt' is an *initiated action*. The post explicitly states the action was ""days away from going through with"" and that the author ""keep living past that date,"" meaning the action was not initiated.
    *   **'Behavior':** The post describes a past situation where the author had explicit suicidal thoughts/desire (""came extraordinarily close to killing myself"") AND also mentions a ""set plan"" and ""letters were written"" (preparations). This perfectly fits the definition of 'Behavior', even though it refers to a past event and the current sentiment is positive. The instruction for 'Attempt' notes that historical actions count if brought up, and by extension, significant past 'Behavior' should also be classified as such if detailed in the post. The post's content *describes* past behavior.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post uses phrases like ""not doing it years ago,"" ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" ""wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it,"" and ""wouldn't be here now."" These all strongly imply a desire to end life or not exist. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""angry at myself,"" ""angry that it would be considered selfish."" These indicate distress and frustration.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None are mentioned. The reference to ""doing it"" is about a past missed opportunity, not a current plan or preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** The post explicitly states ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it."" This indicates a regret for *not* having acted on past suicidal thoughts, rather than describing an initiated action (an attempt).
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** There is no stated imminence for current action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). The desire to not be alive is described as ""fairly regularly since about 2012,"" indicating a chronic state of ideation.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, genuine wish to not be alive and for life to end, expressed as a chronic state and a regret for not having acted on it in the past.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words, but the phrases ""not doing it,"" ""done it,"" ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" and ""wouldn't be here now"" very clearly express a desire to die or not exist.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, unequivocally: ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" ""wish that I had just done it,"" ""wouldn't be here now.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses regret for *not* having acted on them in the past.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. There is no high imminence here, and the ""action"" referred to is a past *missed* opportunity.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a chronic past desire (""since about 2012"") and a current feeling of regret about *not* having acted on those desires in the past (""not doing it years ago,"" ""wish that I had just done it""). There is no mention of a current or future *intended action*.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The phrasing ""not doing it"" and ""wish that I had just done it"" explicitly states that an action *was not* taken, or that the author wishes it *had* been taken, which is the opposite of an initiated attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die/not be alive (""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" ""wish that I had just done it""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide, nor any current intended action. The reference to ""doing it"" is about a past missed opportunity, not a current plan. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   The post explicitly states that the author *did not* act on their past thoughts (""not doing it years ago,"" ""wish that I had just done it""). It describes regret for *not* having made an attempt, rather than describing an actual initiated attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end... without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

306,"How thinking about the administrative side of suicide makes me not want to, while still wanting to die. Hi everyone,. I'm depressed and suicidal. I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine. But, everytime i think about killing myself I also think about the things i should cancel before so that my family doesn't have to. I don't think anyone wants to deal with someone elses administrative stuff while they're dead. It sucks so much because there are times where i just get ready to die but then the administrative thought pops up.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""suicide,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""killing myself,"" ""dead.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depressed,"" ""suicidal,"" ""It sucks so much.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user explicitly states, ""I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a clear act of preparation. They also say ""times where i just get ready to die.""
    *   **References to past actions:** No mention of a past *initiated, potentially lethal action*. Writing a note is a preparation, not an initiated attempt.
    *   **Imminence:** ""times where i just get ready to die"" suggests a recurring high level of readiness, though administrative thoughts act as a barrier.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and persistent desire to die (""still wanting to die,"" ""I'm depressed and suicidal""). The administrative thoughts are a *deterrent* to action, not a negation of the desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" ""wanting to die,"" and ""killing myself.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die.
    *   No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, the *action* is hindered by practical concerns, not a lack of desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a clear preparation is identified: ""I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a concrete step taken in preparation for suicide. While a specific *method* isn't detailed, the *preparation* is explicit.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state (""I'm depressed and suicidal"") and ongoing intentions/readiness (""times where i just get ready to die"").
    *   It describes a past *preparation* (writing the note) but not a past *initiated, potentially lethal action* (an attempt).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is clear, explicit personal desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is strong ideation, the post goes beyond just thoughts/desire by explicitly mentioning a concrete preparation (""written a note"").
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire (""still wanting to die,"" ""suicidal"") AND mentions a specific preparation (""written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine""). This aligns with the definition of Behavior.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past self-initiated, potentially lethal action is described. Writing a note is preparation, not an attempt.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent and the clear mention of a preparation (writing a note/will), the classification is Behavior.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""never been more suicidal in my life.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""I fucked up,"" ""impatience,"" ""got in trouble,"" ""never been more suicidal."" These indicate distress, regret, and a peak in suicidal feelings.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: The ""fucked up"" incident happened ""yesterday,"" leading to the current suicidal feelings. No past *suicidal* actions are mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""never been more suicidal in my life"" indicates a current, intense feeling, but no specific timeline for *acting* on it.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrase ""never been more suicidal in my life"" clearly expresses a personal, current, and intense desire or inclination towards suicide, not merely unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""never been more suicidal in my life"" strongly implies a personal desire or inclination towards suicide.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement indicates a peak in personal suicidal feelings.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - There is no mention of any intended action, method, or plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (trespassing) that led to current, intense suicidal feelings.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The ""fucked up"" action was trespassing, not a suicidal act. The suicidal feeling is current.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""never been more suicidal in my life""). This rules out 'Indicator' as there is clear personal desire/intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action by the author. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/feelings without a plan, method, or past action.

This country is a prison colony and it appears to be testing grounds to removing the flaws and imperfections in the human race and turning men into women.It's what hitler devised that he wanted to remove the flaws and imperfections and  wanted to purify the human race. We are all slaves to a fascist regime  that treats people as a number but we like to pretend that we live in a democracy to give us the illusion of freedom when there is no freedom. We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post uses terms like ""Auschwitz"" and references ""Hitler"" and ""removing flaws and imperfections in the human race."" These terms are associated with genocide and mass death, but they are used in a political/social commentary context to describe the perceived state of Australia, not the author's personal suicidal ideation or intent. There are no direct mentions of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses strong negative emotions like anger, despair, and a sense of oppression (""prison colony,"" ""slaves to a fascist regime,"" ""no freedom""). However, these emotions are directed outward at a perceived societal/governmental issue, not inward as personal hopelessness about the author's own life or existence.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** None related to self-harm or suicide.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No stated intentions related to self-harm or suicide.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a desire for freedom from a perceived oppressive regime, not a desire to die or for their own life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. The post's focus is on political/social commentary and perceived societal control, not personal desire for death.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act.
    *   No signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes the author's current political/social views and feelings about Australia. There is no description of a past, current, or future self-initiated suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress and negative sentiment, but this distress is related to a perceived external political/social environment, not the author's personal suicidal ideation or intent.
    *   There is no explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, or any mention of plans, methods, or past attempts.
    *   While the language is extreme and uses metaphors of death/genocide, it is clearly in the context of political commentary and not personal suicidal ideation.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'. It fits 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and negative emotions, but lacks any clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""Heaven seems really good right now,"" ""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus."" These are clear expressions of a desire for death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hurts so much,"" ""feel so alone,"" ""terrifying,"" ""dislike or are indifferent to me,"" ""family doesn't love me,"" ""friends just put up with me,"" ""mocked,"" ""nobodies first choice."" These indicate profound loneliness, despair, and feelings of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquiring means are described.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** The desire to die is stated as a current, strong wish (""I just want to die...Thats what I want more than anything else.""). The mention of college is a future event causing distress, but the desire to die is present now.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a genuine and explicit wish to die (""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus. Thats what I want more than anything else.""). This is not about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not these specific phrases, but ""I just want to die"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire for death.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus. Thats what I want more than anything else.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to die is stated as a wanted outcome (""Thats what I want more than anything else."").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The desire is to ""go to Heaven and be with Jesus,"" which is the desired outcome, not a method or plan for achieving death.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While the desire is strong, there is no reference to *any* action or *how* death would be achieved, only the desire for death itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire (""I just want to die"") and future anxieties related to college.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I just want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not abstract distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a direct personal wish.
    *   The post does *not* mention any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out the desire to die. It's purely an expression of the wish to die. This absence of a plan/method/action rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does *not* describe any past self-initiated potentially lethal actions. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end, but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no vague reference to action that implies a method (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") beyond the direct statement of ""considering suicide."" The imminence is high (""right now""), but the *how* is completely absent.

    *   The post describes a current intention: ""Right now i'm considering suicide.""
    *   It does not describe any past, specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

The post also extensively discusses the *friend's* ""multiple suicide attempts per month"" and ""times they've attempted to kill her,"" and a friend who died ""due to suicide."" However, the classification is for the *person writing the post*.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author expresses being ""scared,"" ""confused,"" ""having a bit of a breakdown over this,"" and ""this fucking sucks.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** For the author, there are *no* mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for their own suicidal feelings. All such details (e.g., ""attempts"") refer to the friend.
    *   **References to past actions:** The author does not describe any past self-initiated suicidal actions. The past actions mentioned are those of the friend.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The statement ""I'm suicidal myself"" indicates a current state of being. ""I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this"" indicates current distress. There is no specific imminence for an action mentioned by the author.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly states, ""I'm suicidal myself,"" indicating a personal desire or current state of suicidal ideation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, the author states, ""I'm suicidal myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'm suicidal myself"" directly expresses this.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement ""I'm suicidal myself"" is a direct, unnegated expression of their current state.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Just kill me,"" ""Just end my life."" These are direct and explicit expressions of a desire for death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""end my pain"" indicates severe distress and suffering.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. There is no indication of how the user intends to achieve this end, or any tools/locations.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: The plea ""Please! I beg you"" suggests high emotional distress and urgency, but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is given for a personal action. The plea is directed outwardly, asking someone else to end their life.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear and unequivocal desire for life to end and for death. This is not about unwanted thoughts; it's a direct expression of desire.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""Just kill me,"" ""Just end my life.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, clearly.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they are pleading for it.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While the desire is intense, there is no reference to *any* action the user intends to take, nor any method, even vague. The plea is to *others* to end their life.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, intense desire/plea.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (""Just kill me,"" ""end my life""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator', as it's not general distress or unwanted thoughts, but a clear desire.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out the desire. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. The plea is for someone else to end their life, not a statement of their own intended action or plan.
    - There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action by the author. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear personal desire for death without any specific plan, method, or intended action.

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above.

    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""end my own life,"" ""killing myself,"" ""suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the core of the post is the writer's ""logic"" that it is ""utilitarian for me to end my own life"" and their desire to ""check I'm making the right decision"" regarding suicide.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. While there's an internal conflict and a ""cry for help"" element, the primary sentiment is a rationalization *for* suicide and a desire to validate that decision, not a statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that they don't want to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a vague reference to action implying a method/plan with high imminence? No. The imminence is not high; the user is in a state of logical deliberation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current consideration and future intention.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The mention of ""never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone"" refers to past self-harm, but it is not described as a suicide attempt (an initiated action with suicidal intent).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a personal desire and logical justification for ending their life (""I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life,"" ""I want to check I'm making the right decision""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or any preparations. The user is in a deliberative, logical state, not describing steps they are taking or intend to take. Thus, it fits 'Ideation'.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** There is no description of a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action with suicidal intent. The past self-harm mentioned is not characterized as a suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

The post expresses clear suicidal intent and thoughts but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation.

I won't ever be happy in this world and how it is now. Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure. I'm from the UK, so i can't get hold of a gun which would solve everything. Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""end it all,"" ""gun which would solve everything,"" ""end it all if we don't want to be here."" The word ""gun"" is a specific method.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm so tired,"" ""won't ever be happy,"" ""Everything is a chore,"" ""everyday is pressure."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and a desire for life to end.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly mentions ""a gun which would solve everything."" While the user states they can't get one, it identifies a specific method they believe would be effective. The subsequent question, ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"", indicates a search for a method or plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the desire to ""end it all"" is current and strong.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and strong desire for life to end (""I don't want it anymore,"" ""won't ever be happy,"" ""end it all if we don't want to be here"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not with those exact words, but phrases like ""I don't want it anymore"" and ""end it all"" clearly convey suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, unequivocally (""I don't want it anymore,"" ""won't ever be happy in this world,"" ""end it all if we don't want to be here"").
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; the thoughts ""always just come back to this"" (referring to ending it all), and the writer expresses a desire for an ""option"" to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""a gun which would solve everything"" is a specific method. The question ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"" indicates a search for a viable method/plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The desire to die is very strong. The mention of a ""gun"" is a specific method, and the active search for ""a good option"" implies a current consideration of *how* to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current/future intention to end life, along with a search for a method.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die/end life, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because it mentions a specific method (""gun"") and expresses a desire to find ""a good option for us to end it all,"" indicating a current consideration of *how* to carry out the suicidal intent. This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition, which includes mentioning a plan, specific method, or intended action. Even though the preferred method (gun) is stated as inaccessible, the explicit mention of it and the active search for *any* ""good option"" demonstrates a focus on the 'how'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit desire to die and the mention of a specific method (gun) coupled with the search for other ""options to end it all,"" the post best fits the 'Behavior' category.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not. I believe in God but sometimes he feels so far away. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to post. I have no one to talk to.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The post contains ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die."" It also has ""I would worry about them if I died"" and ""I would die for them"" (the latter being figurative).

    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of intentions:** The phrases ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die"" express a desire or a reaction to distress, but they do not convey immediate intent or imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear expression of a desire to die in moments of distress (""I wish I could die,"" ""when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die""). This is not explicitly stated as an unwanted thought; rather, it's a personal expression of despair.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die"" express a desire for life to end in response to distress.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as a personal feeling/wish in response to overwhelming emotions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The imminence is not high, and there is no vague reference to action beyond the wish to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and wishes (""I wish I could die"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I wish I could die,"" ""I wish I could curl up and die"") in the context of distress and feeling like a failure. This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide, and the desire is not stated as unwanted. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for carrying out these wishes. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

316,"Nsfw. So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing. Terrible feeling and I just wanted to get it out of my head, sorry you had to read this, nasty",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""thinking about wanting to kill myself"" and ""masturbating to the thought of killing myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""disappointed in myself,"" ""dislike it,"" ""feel like shit,"" ""disgusted,"" ""hateful I felt towards myself,"" ""ugly I felt,"" ""Terrible feeling."" These indicate significant distress.

    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions initiated by the author are mentioned.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself."" This indicates ongoing suicidal ideation, but no immediate or imminent plan to act.

    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/for life to end through ""wanting to kill myself.""

    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - There is a desire to die, but no indication of a plan, method, or intended action, even vague. The masturbation is a coping mechanism for the thoughts/feelings, not a step towards an actual suicidal act.

    - It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed. Thanks for making it this far if you read the whole thing.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly discusses ""suicide"" multiple times, refers to ""die prematurely,"" and ""end my life."" It also mentions ""kill themselves"" in a general sense. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author expresses a strong personal conviction that suicide is a ""solution"" and a ""means of escape."" There's a sense of despair regarding societal understanding (""No one is really listening,"" ""no support"") and frustration with stigma. The author states they ""would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan (e.g., location, time), method (e.g., pills, gun), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The phrase ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"" indicates strong intent, but not a plan or method.
    *   **References to past actions:** No mention of past self-initiated suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The intent is stated as a future certainty (""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life""), but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is given. The final sentence about going to bed after a long shift suggests no immediate action is planned for that moment.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly expresses a personal desire to die and for life to end (""would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives,"" ""suicide is seen as a solution,"" ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life""). They are not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; rather, they are defending their view of suicide as a valid personal choice for themselves.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""end my life,"" which are direct phrases.
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and for life to end (""would rather die prematurely,"" ""suicide is seen as a solution,"" ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them. On the contrary, they are advocating for their personal right to choose suicide and view it as a solution.

    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no vague reference to action implying a method or plan coupled with high imminence. The imminence is low (going to bed).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current perspective and a future intention (""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"").
    *   It does not describe a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life,"" ""would rather die prematurely""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not just general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a stated personal desire and intent.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'. While the intent is strong, the ""how"" is completely absent.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

318,"""your not cutting your faking it!"" stares at my arm motherfuckerly. Im tired of all the people who miraculously believe that im either cutting for attention or faking it. I've had issues with self harm in the past and I've gotten to the point where nobody really believes that im in pain. A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post directly mentions ""cutting"" multiple times, ""self harm in the past,"" and describes a specific past instance of cutting (""used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out""). It also mentions ""encouraging K to kill herself,"" but this is directed at someone else (K), not the author. The author states, ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore,"" which is a clear expression of despair and questioning the value of life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Tired, numb, empty inside, pain, cried myself to sleep, feels nobody believes their pain.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation for a *suicidal act* is mentioned for the author. The past cutting incident is described as an act to ""relieve some of the pain,"" which is characteristic of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), not a suicide attempt with intent to die.
    *   **References to past actions:** The author clearly describes a past, specific instance of self-harm (""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside... i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back... she saw my arm and freaked out""). They also state generally, ""I've had issues with self harm in the past"" and ""Btw theres about a dozen scars.""
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" expresses current despair and questioning of life's value, but no immediate suicidal intent or plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses profound despair and questions the value of their life (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore""). This indicates a desire for life to end or a strong sense that life is not worth living.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" for the author.
    *   The post expresses a clear desire for life to end or questions its worth: ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore."" This is a strong expression of suicidal ideation.
    *   The writer does not explicitly state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation for a *suicidal act* is mentioned. The past cutting was described as an act to ""relieve some of the pain,"" indicating self-harm (NSSI) rather than a suicide attempt with intent to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past actions (the cutting incident ""a few months ago,"" general ""issues with self harm in the past"") and current feelings/ideation (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"").
    *   The past action described (""used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back... she saw my arm and freaked out"") is a specific, self-initiated physical action. However, the stated intent (""to relieve some of the pain"") points to non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) rather than a suicide attempt (where the intent is to die). The definition of 'Attempt' specifically refers to *suicidal* actions. While cutting can be potentially lethal, the intent described here is not suicidal.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** The post goes beyond general distress. ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is a direct expression of questioning the value of life, which is a form of suicidal ideation.
    *   **Ideation:** The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" clearly fits the definition of ""profound expressions of wanting life to end"" or ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" There is no specific plan, method, or intended action for suicide mentioned.
    *   **Behavior:** No specific plan, method, or preparation for a *suicidal act* is mentioned. The past cutting incident is not described with suicidal intent.
    *   **Attempt:** The past cutting incident, while a self-initiated action and potentially lethal, is described as an act to ""relieve some of the pain,"" which is characteristic of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) rather than a suicide attempt where the intent is to die. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' in this context.

Based on the current expression of profound despair and questioning life's worth, without a specific plan or method for suicide, the classification is Ideation. The past self-harm, while significant, is not described as a suicide attempt.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""suicidal ideation,"" ""act on my suicidal thoughts.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. Crucially, the post states the opposite: ""I'd rather... go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts."" The primary intent is to *avoid* acting on the thoughts and to get professional help.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Yes, ""I'd rather... go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point."" This is a strong indicator for 'Indicator' based on the definition.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current struggle with suicidal ideation and a future intention to seek help for it.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   However, the key distinction lies in the writer's *desire* regarding these thoughts. The writer explicitly states a preference to ""go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts."" This indicates that while suicidal thoughts are present, they are *unwanted* and the author is actively seeking to *prevent* acting on them.
    *   According to the definition of 'Indicator': ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The post perfectly fits this criterion.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because the desire to act on the thoughts is explicitly negated; the desire is to *not* act and to seek help.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' as no plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past initiated action is described.
    *   Therefore, the post expresses distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts, with an explicit desire to seek help rather than act on them.

Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution for drug addicts and mentally ill people and be forced anti psychotics there. Fuck that I once took a anti psychotic and it just kills me inside and some 'other person' takes over. My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, hopelessness, anger, feeling betrayed (""Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel!"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily."" This is an ongoing, high-risk behavior. When combined with the explicit desire to die ""soon,"" it strongly implies that the heroin use is either the intended method or a behavior the author hopes will lead to death. The impending forced institutionalization serves as a clear trigger/imminent event.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I once took a anti psychotic..."" (not a suicidal action).
    *   **Imminence:** ""Soon I will be finally dead."" ""Within 4 weeks"" is a specific timeframe for the triggering event.
    *   **Stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly expresses a clear desire to die (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead"").
    *   There is no negation of these thoughts; they represent a personal desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The phrase ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily"" is a concrete, ongoing action involving a potentially lethal substance.
    *   Coupled with the explicit desire to die ""soon"" and the context of avoiding forced treatment, this ongoing heroin use can be interpreted as the chosen, albeit potentially indirect or prolonged, method to achieve death. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a specific method, an intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence)."" The daily use of heroin, in this context, functions as a method to achieve the stated desire to die soon. It's an active engagement in a behavior that the author hopes will lead to their death.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current actions (""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily"") and future intentions (""Soon I will be finally dead"") tied to an imminent event (""Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution"").
    *   No past initiated *suicidal* action is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** There is a clear, personal expression of desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Not Attempt:** No past initiated suicidal action is described.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post contains clear ideation (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead""). However, it also describes a current, ongoing action (""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily"") that, in the context of the explicit desire for death soon and the impending forced treatment, functions as a method or intended action to achieve death. The daily use of a lethal substance, explicitly linked to the desire to die ""soon,"" moves this beyond mere thoughts into the realm of active, high-risk behavior intended to lead to death. This fits the 'Behavior' definition of mentioning a plan, method, or intended action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post directly asks ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem."" This is an explicit mention of a specific lethal method (gun) and a target (brain stem) for self-inflicted death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things."" This indicates profound hopelessness, anhedonia, and a complete rejection of reasons to live, strongly implying a desire to die.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** The question itself (""What position of the gun is best..."") is a direct inquiry about optimizing a specific method for a suicidal act. This indicates active planning or seeking information for a specific method.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the directness of the question about a specific lethal method implies a current and serious consideration.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states they ""genuinely do not care for any of those things"" (reasons to live), indicating a clear desire for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact phrases, but the phrase ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem"" is a clear, direct inquiry about a method for self-inflicted death.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the rejection of ""family will miss you,"" ""so much to live for,"" and stating ""I genuinely do not care for any of those things"" clearly expresses a desire for life to end and a profound indifference to living.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively seeking information to facilitate the act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""gun"" and ""brain stem"" are explicitly mentioned as the method and target.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Asking for specific information on how to effectively use a gun for suicide (""What position... is best"") is a clear sign of active planning or seeking to prepare for an act.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The desire to die is present, and the inquiry about a specific, lethal method (""gun,"" ""brain stem"") is not vague; it's highly specific and indicative of a plan or intended action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current inquiry related to a future intention.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire to die (Ideation) because it explicitly mentions a specific method (""gun"") and seeks information on how to effectively use it (""best position... for hitting the brain stem""). This constitutes active planning or preparation for a suicidal act.
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not an 'Attempt'.
    *   It clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and a desire to die, so it is not an 'Indicator'.
    *   Therefore, it best fits 'Behavior' due to the explicit mention of a method and the active inquiry about its effective use.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""thought about killing myself."" It also mentions ""self harm scars,"" indicating past self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""everything just keeps getting worse,"" ""nothing to be upset over and i'm dramatic and stuff lol"" (sarcastic, indicating invalidation and distress). This suggests hopelessness and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""my mum saw my self harm scars"" refers to past self-harm, not a past suicide attempt. The phrase ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself"" refers to persistent past and current suicidal ideation, not an initiated action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The thoughts are described as persistent (""every single day,"" ""it wont leave my head""), but there's no indication of imminent action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""thought about killing myself"" indicates a clear personal engagement with suicidal thoughts. While ""it wont leave my head"" suggests intrusiveness, it does not explicitly negate the desire to die or state that the thoughts are unwanted in the sense of ""I don't want to feel this way."" It's more about the persistence of the thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the persistent ""thought about killing myself"" in the context of ""everything just keeps getting worse"" strongly implies a personal desire or profound ideation.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. ""It won't leave my head"" indicates persistence, but not a negation of personal desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes persistent, ongoing suicidal thoughts (""hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself""). It also mentions past self-harm (""self harm scars"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The ""self harm scars"" indicate past self-harm, which is a risk factor, but the post does not describe this as a suicide *attempt* (i.e., an initiated action with lethal intent). There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""thought about killing myself""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator' because there is a clear personal expression of suicidal intent/ideation, and it's not explicitly stated as unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated suicidal action*. The self-harm scars indicate past self-harm, which is distinct from a suicide attempt as defined here (an initiated potentially lethal action). This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear and persistent suicidal thoughts without a plan or initiated action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself"", ""my only way out is killing myself"", ""Let's just do it"", ""I'm sick of life"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what the fuck to do anymore"", ""I still feel like trash"", ""convinced my only way out"", ""sick of life"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), location (e.g., bridge), or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Let's just do it"" implies an intention to act, but lacks the *how*.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""Let's just do it"" suggests a strong, immediate desire to act.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, genuine wish to die and for life to end (""my only way out is killing myself"", ""I'm sick of life""). This is not about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"".
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die and for life to end (""my only way out is killing myself"", ""I'm sick of life"").
    - The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they align with the writer's desire.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - While ""Let's just do it"" indicates high imminence and intent to act, it does not specify *how* the action will be carried out. The definition for 'Behavior' requires a ""plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations being taken."" While ""Let's just do it"" is an intended action, it lacks any specificity regarding the method, even a vague one like ""make the pain physical"" (which implies a physical action). Without *any* indication of *how* the action will be taken, it remains in the realm of ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""Let's just do it"").
    - It does not describe any past initiated, potentially lethal actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent (""killing myself"", ""sick of life"").
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action.
    - The post expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to act (""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it. I'm sick of life""). This clearly fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - It does *not* fit 'Behavior' because, despite the high imminence and desire to act, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The phrase ""Let's just do it"" indicates intent, but not *how* that intent will be carried out. If there was even a vague method (e.g., ""I'm going to do something to make it stop,"" implying a physical action, or ""I'm going to take pills,"" even if not specified), it would lean towards Behavior. But ""Let's just do it"" by itself, without any method, keeps it in Ideation.

        *   While no *new* specific method is stated for the *upcoming* attempt, the mention of past ""overdose"" attempts provides context, and the phrase ""attempt again"" implies a planned action.
    *   **References to past actions:**
        *   ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out"" (Clear, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions)
        *   ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year."" (Clear, self-initiated, potentially lethal action)

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""attempt again,"" ""I want to die,"" and ""a mind that wants to die.""
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die and for life to end.
    *   The writer explicitly states they *do not* want to get better and *are not* fighting anymore, indicating a personal desire to die, not just distress about unwanted thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   There is a clear intention to act (""I'm going to attempt again"") with high imminence (""Just a few more hours"").
    *   ""Goodbye"" serves as a preparation/farewell.
    *   While a *new* specific method for the *upcoming* attempt isn't detailed, the explicit intention to ""attempt again"" combined with the high imminence and farewell note strongly indicates a planned action. The past methods (""overdose"") are also mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past actions and a current/future intention.
    *   **Past actions:** ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year."" These are clear descriptions of *specific, potentially lethal actions that were initiated by the author*.
    *   **Current/Future intention:** ""Just a few more hours... I'm going to attempt again."" This indicates a current plan for a future action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong elements of 'Ideation' (explicit desire to die, ""I want to die"") and 'Behavior' (clear intention to ""attempt again"" with high imminence and a farewell ""Goodbye"").
    *   However, the post *also* explicitly describes *past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions* by the author: ""I've tried to overdose three times"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year.""
    *   According to the rules: ""**'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author**, even if current ideation/behavior is also present."" The author clearly describes multiple past attempts and links them to their current state (""I'm going to attempt again"").

Therefore, based on the precedence rule for 'Attempt', this post falls into that category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: No explicit mentions. The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" is present.
    - Emotional indicators: Overwhelming despair, hopelessness (""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore""), feeling stuck, burden, past trauma (friend drowned, father pedophile, mother's illness), family estrangement, alcoholism.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: Mentions past life events (friend's death, father's abuse, mother's illness, becoming an alcoholic). No past *suicidal* actions by the author.
    - Imminence: ""I can't anymore"" and ""I just want this pain to end"" suggest a current, strong desire for cessation of suffering. No specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""soon.""
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I just want this pain to end"" in this context of extreme distress strongly implies a desire for life to end as a means to stop the pain. There is no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts or desire.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"": No.
    - Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end: Yes. ""I just want this pain to end"" is a strong expression of wanting to escape life's suffering, which in this context implies a desire for life to cease. ""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore"" reinforces a giving-up sentiment.
    - Explicitly unwanted thoughts: No. The desire is stated as a personal wish.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned: No.
    - Signs of preparation: No.
    - Vague reference to action with high imminence/intent: While intent is high, there is no vague reference to an action or method. It's purely a desire for the pain to end.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Describes a past event, current/future intention: Describes a current state of overwhelming pain and a current desire for it to end, stemming from past and ongoing life events.
    - Describes a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past: No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses profound despair and a clear desire for the pain to end (""I just want this pain to end""), which in this context signifies a desire for life to end. This goes beyond general distress and is a personal expression of wanting to stop living. Therefore, it fits 'Ideation' more than 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. This distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    - The core element is the strong, personal desire for the pain to end, implying a wish for life to cease, without any action component. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""I'm suicidal"" and expresses a clear desire to ""fucking go"" and ""not make it past this summer.""
    - The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions. The desire is clearly present.

    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - There is no vague reference to an action that implies a method or plan, even with the high intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current state of being suicidal and a future intention/prediction (""don't think I'll make it past this summer,"" ""time for me to fucking go"").
    - It does not describe a past, specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal"") and a desire to end life (""don't think I'll make it past this summer,"" ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry. I'm so sorry. There is no putting me back together. Im broken. I'm damaged. I'm all fucked up. I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work. I promise I wont fail this time. I'm gonna buy the right stuff. Say my goodbyes to the one I love. Gonna be gone after this weekend. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""It's over for me."" (Implies end of life)
        *   ""sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself"" (External suggestion, not author's intent)
        *   ""I can't take it anymore. I can't do this."" (Extreme distress, inability to cope)
        *   ""I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is."" (Specific method, desire for painless death)
        *   ""I should have killed myself a long time ago."" (Regret about not having died by suicide)
        *   ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" (Explicit statement of a past initiated suicidal action/attempt)
        *   ""I promise I wont fail this time."" (Intent to succeed in a future attempt)
        *   ""Gonna be gone after this weekend."" (Clear statement of future death/disappearance)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""It's over for me,"" ""no putting me back together,"" ""I'm broken""), despair (""drowning in depression, in self hatred""), self-hatred (""fucked up garbage,"" ""monster,"" ""mistake,"" ""trash,"" ""disgrace,"" ""I hate myself too""), guilt (""I am sorry to this world"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   Method: ""hanging""
        *   Preparations: ""buy the right stuff,"" ""Say my goodbyes to the one I love.""
        *   Imminence: ""Gonna be gone after this weekend.""
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This is a clear description of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""Gonna be gone after this weekend."" (High imminence).
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die and end their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""It's over for me,"" ""Gonna be gone after this weekend,"" ""I promise I won't fail this time"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""hanging""), preparations (""buy the right stuff,"" ""Say my goodbyes""), and a timeframe (""after this weekend"") are mentioned. This indicates 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a past event and future intentions.
    *   **Past event:** ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This clearly describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that was attempted but failed. This fits the definition of 'Attempt'.
    *   **Current/Future intention:** ""I promise I wont fail this time. I'm gonna buy the right stuff. Say my goodbyes... Gonna be gone after this weekend."" This describes current planning and future intent, which would typically lead to 'Behavior'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong elements of Ideation (desire to die, self-hatred) and Behavior (specific method, preparations, imminent timeframe).
    *   However, the post also explicitly states: ""I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This is a direct description by the author of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   According to the definitions, ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" And, ""'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.""
    *   Therefore, despite the strong current behavioral elements, the clear description of a past attempt takes precedence.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""killing myself"", ""Adios i can't"", ""It's not worth it"", ""this life for me isn't it"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't know what's wrong with me"", ""I'm sorry to the people i know in advance"", ""But this life for me isn't it."" - indicating despair, hopelessness, and a desire for life to end.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge), tools, substances, or locations are mentioned. No preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The ""planning"" is highly conditional and distant in time.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** The stated intention is ""at 30 or 25. Depends lol."" This is a very distant, conditional future intention, not immediate. ""I still have a long time to rethink my decisions.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire for life to end if current feelings persist: ""But if i still feel the same or worse by the time im around that age. Adios i can't. It's not worth it. ... But this life for me isn't it.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and expresses a clear desire for life to end (""this life for me isn't it,"" ""It's not worth it"").
    *   The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts; rather, they state a conditional future intent to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no vague reference to action implying a method or plan coupled with high imminence. The imminence is very low (years away). The ""planning"" is conceptual and conditional, not a concrete step towards action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a future, conditional intention (""at 30 or 25"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post contains clear, personal expressions of suicidal intent (""I'm planning on killing myself,"" ""this life for me isn't it""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a stated desire for life to end. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. However, it *lacks any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations*. While the word ""planning"" is used, the context (""at 30 or 25. Depends lol. I still have a long time to rethink my decisions."") indicates a distant, conditional thought process rather than a concrete, actionable plan with a method or preparation. The definition of 'Behavior' requires mention of a *specific* plan, method, intended action, or preparations. Since these are absent, it falls under 'Ideation'.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No past self-initiated actions are described. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

    The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation and a desire to die, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying it out. The ""planning"" refers to a distant, conditional future state rather than an imminent or concrete action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide rate"" in a statistical context.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Been teetering on the edge lately."" This indicates significant distress or being at a breaking point. The user also expresses feeling ""perceived as male and a threat"" and ""eyed with suspicion,"" which contributes to the distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions by the author are mentioned. The ""suicide rate"" is a general statistic.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No stated intentions to act, so no imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" implies being close to a breaking point or a crisis. While this can be associated with suicidal thoughts, it doesn't explicitly state a personal desire to die, to not be alive, or for life to end. The context following this phrase focuses on societal perception and empathy for others, rather than a direct personal suicidal wish.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""suicide rate"" is mentioned, but this is a general observation/statistic, not a personal statement of intent or desire to die.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. ""Teetering on the edge"" expresses being overwhelmed or at a crisis point, but it does not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't here,"" or ""I want it to be over."" The focus is on the external pressures and their impact, leading to a general state of distress.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Not applicable, as explicit suicidal thoughts are not stated as personal intent.
    *   **If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned OR the desire is clearly negated/unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'.** The post mentions ""suicide"" but only in a statistical context. The personal expression ""teetering on the edge"" indicates distress but is not a direct statement of suicidal desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparations are mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state of distress (""Been teetering on the edge lately"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past or present.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress (""teetering on the edge lately"") due to external factors (""perceived as male and a threat""). It mentions ""suicide rate"" but only in a statistical context, not as a personal intent. There is no explicit statement of a personal desire to die or explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't here""). There are no plans, methods, or past attempts described.
    *   The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" signifies being at a breaking point or in a difficult emotional state, which is a strong indicator of distress and potential vulnerability, but it does not equate to a direct, personal expression of suicidal ideation. It falls under ""general distress, sadness, hopelessness"" as per the 'Indicator' definition, lacking ""a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide is a coward way to go out"" (quoted from mom), ""if I'm gone within 24 hours"" (author's own statement).
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, hurt (""Thanks mom. :(""), a sense of finality.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned. However, ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling"" is a strong farewell message, which constitutes a preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""within 24 hours"" indicates very high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" clearly expresses a personal desire to die or end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide"" is mentioned, and ""gone within 24 hours"" is a direct expression of intent to die.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" combined with the farewell implies a clear desire to end life.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the opposite is implied.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned? No specific method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling"" is a clear goodbye/farewell message, which is a form of preparation.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: The statement ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" is a statement of intended action with high imminence, even if the specific method is not detailed. Combined with the farewell, it strongly indicates intent to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A current/future intention (""within 24 hours"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - This is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die (""gone within 24 hours"").
    - This is not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond just thoughts or desire. There is a clear statement of intended action with high imminence (""gone within 24 hours"") and a form of preparation (a farewell message, ""Peace out all""). The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""an intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence), or preparations being taken."" This post fits both of these criteria.
    - This is not 'Attempt' because no past initiated action is described.

Therefore, the post best fits the 'Behavior' category due to the explicit suicidal intent, high imminence, and the presence of a farewell message (preparation) and a statement of intended action.

The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""it's killing me"" is present. This is an idiom for extreme emotional distress, not a literal statement of suicidal intent. There are no other mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** High levels of distress, self-hatred (""I hate myself""), hopelessness (""I don't have a choice,"" ""no proof""), feeling trapped, emotional manipulation, and a sense of being silenced.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None related to suicide. The plans mentioned are to get a restraining order and move out.
    *   **References to past actions:** Past abuse, contacting authorities, dropping accusations. No past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No suicidal intentions stated. The stated desires (restraining order, moving out) are future-oriented.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a strong desire to escape the abusive situation, get a restraining order, move out, and be able to talk about their experiences. There is no stated desire to die or for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is an idiom for severe emotional pain, not a literal desire for death. The primary focus is on the abuse and the desire to escape it.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. There is no explicit desire to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past abuse, current living situation, and future desires to escape the situation.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped due to ongoing abuse. However, it *lacks* any explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is an idiomatic expression of emotional pain, not a literal statement of suicidal intent. The writer's stated desires are focused on resolving their abusive living situation (getting a restraining order, moving out), not on ending their life.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no direct or implied personal desire to die or suicidal thoughts.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no mention of a plan, method, or intended action related to suicide.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as there is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action.
    *   Therefore, it best fits 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress and hopelessness without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""self harm"" (repeatedly), ""harming,"" ""bloodying myself up now"" (current action), ""kill myself"" (future intent), and ""do it now"" (immediate intent). No specific lethal method is named for ""kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, hopelessness, feeling of failure (""swore to my family I could stop... Now after four months I'm self harming again.""), frustration (""What the hell makes them think this won't end badly."").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific lethal method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) for suicide is mentioned. No explicit preparations for suicide (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means). However, ""I'm bloodying myself up now"" is a current self-harm *action*, and ""I should do it now and save time"" is a statement of immediate *intended action* to kill themselves.
    *   **References to past actions:** Describes a relapse into self-harm after four months, not a past suicide attempt. ""It started with an old trigger, then every little problem... ended with my harming.""
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""now,"" ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself,"" ""I should do it now."" This indicates very high and immediate imminence for suicidal action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die: ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself,"" ""I should do it now and save time.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I should do it now and save time"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions. The desire is clearly personal and immediate.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific lethal method or preparation for suicide is named.
    *   However, the post states ""I'm bloodying myself up now"" (current self-harm action) and immediately follows with ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time."" The phrase ""I should do it now"" is a strong statement of *intended action* with high imminence. While no specific lethal method is described, the explicit intent to ""do it now"" (kill myself) combined with the current self-harm (indicating active self-destructive behavior) pushes this beyond mere ideation. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence)."" ""I should do it now"" fits this criterion.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past context (four months without self-harm, relapse this weekend) and current/future intention (""I'm bloodying myself up now,"" ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself,"" ""I should do it now"").
    *   It describes current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now""), but not a past or very recent *initiated potentially lethal action* that constitutes a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** There is a clear, explicit, personal desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""I should do it now"").
    *   **Not Attempt:** The post describes current self-harm and suicidal ideation/intent, but not a past initiated *suicide attempt* (a specific, potentially lethal action by the author to end their life).
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""kill myself,"" ""it's a matter of time""). However, the phrase ""I should do it now and save time"" represents a clear, immediate *intended action* to commit suicide. The high imminence (""now"") and the stated intention to act, even without a specific method, align with the definition of 'Behavior' which includes ""intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence)."" The current self-harm also indicates an active state of self-destructive behavior, making the immediate suicidal intent more concrete than just a thought.

    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** High imminence suggested by ""im fucking done"" and ""please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience"" (implies urgency to prevent something else).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No explicit ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""blow my head off"" and ""please kill me"" are direct expressions of a desire for death.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, unequivocally (""im fucking done,"" ""deserve death,"" ""blow my head off,"" ""please kill me"").
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire for death is clearly stated and personal.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""blow my head off"" is a specific, violent method of dying. While phrased as a request for someone else to do it, it indicates a desired *method* of death.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. ""blow my head off"" is more than vague; it's a specific method.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire for death and for life to end (""im fucking done,"" ""deserve death,"" ""please kill me""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The phrase ""blow my head off"" describes a specific, violent method of death. Even though it's phrased as a plea for someone else to carry it out, it specifies *how* the desired death should occur. This goes beyond mere general suicidal thoughts or desire (Ideation) because a specific method is articulated. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions... a specific method, an intended action."" The desire for this specific action/method, even if by external means, fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the presence of a specific method (""blow my head off"") coupled with strong suicidal intent and high imminence leads to 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrases ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life"" are direct mentions of suicide/death. No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned, only the general act of ending life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""very anxious,"" ""struggle,"" ""unfortunate,"" ""no plan,"" ""can't keep a job,"" ""won't work out long term."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being overwhelmed by future prospects.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** No specific plan, method, tool, location, or preparation (like writing a note or acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Cut my life short"" is an expression of intent, not a specific method.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""My only option is to cut my life short,"" ""If I ended my life right now."" This indicates high imminence and a strong current desire.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly states a desire for their life to end as a solution to their problems (""My only option is to cut my life short,"" ""If I ended my life right now this wouldn't be a problem""). This is not an expression of unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""cut my life short,"" ""ended my life.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""My only option is to cut my life short,"" ""If I ended my life right now this wouldn't be a problem.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is presented as a solution.
    *   **Conclusion:** Clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. ""Cut my life short"" is a general statement of ending life, not a specific method like ""take pills"" or ""jump from a bridge.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context. While imminence is high (""right now""), the phrasing ""cut my life short"" lacks any specific action or method, even a vague one that points to a specific *type* of action. It's an expression of the *outcome* rather than the *how*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""My only option is to cut my life short,"" ""If I ended my life right now"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent.
    *   'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end (""My only option is to cut my life short,"" ""If I ended my life right now""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
        *   For 'Behavior', there needs to be a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. While the intent is strong and imminent, the phrase ""cut my life short"" does not provide any specific method or action. It's a general statement of intent to end life, not a concrete plan or method (e.g., ""I'm going to use X method,"" ""I'm going to Y location""). The vagueness of the ""method"" means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation'.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" - strongly implies suicidal actions.
        *   ""I want to die"" - explicit suicidal intent.
        *   ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning"" - describes a specific, self-initiated action using a method (pills) with clear lethal intent.
        *   ""if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again"" - expresses desire for death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""failure,"" ""can't stand the person looking back at me,"" ""hate myself,"" ""despise myself,"" ""scared,"" ""content in knowing that if I was gone."" High levels of despair, self-loathing, hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post describes a completed action: ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"". This is a specific method and an initiated action.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again."" These are clear descriptions of initiated, potentially lethal actions in the very recent past (last 4 days, yesterday).
    *   **Imminence:** The actions described occurred ""Yesterday"" and ""in the last 4 days,"" indicating very recent attempts.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I want to die,"" ""hoped I wouldn't wake up,"" ""content in knowing that if I was gone."" Clear, strong desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly states ""to end it all"" and ""I want to die,"" and ""hoped I wouldn't wake up.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they describe acting on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method and action are described: ""took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers."" This is not just a plan but an *initiated action*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes past, very recent events (""Yesterday I took..."", ""failed twice in the last 4 days""). It also expresses current desire (""I want to die"").
    *   Yes, it describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past: ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again."" This is a clear description of a self-initiated, potentially lethal action that occurred very recently and failed.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""I want to die"").
    *   Crucially, it describes *self-initiated actions* in the very recent past that were potentially lethal and intended to cause death (""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" and specifically ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning"").
    *   This perfectly aligns with the 'Attempt' definition: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death.""
    *   Even though there is current ideation, the clear description of a past initiated action takes precedence for classification as 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""horrible life,"" ""life sucks,"" ""total curse,"" ""no way out,"" ""bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life,"" ""I have nothing."" These indicate profound distress, hopelessness, despair, and feeling trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions being ""bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life."" This refers to past experiences of mistreatment, not past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence:** No statements about immediate intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses extreme dissatisfaction with life and a sense of being trapped and unlucky. There is no explicit statement of a desire to die or for life to end. The focus is on the unfairness and difficulty of their current existence and past experiences.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No explicit desire to die. While phrases like ""horrible life,"" ""life sucks,"" ""total curse,"" and ""no way out"" convey deep despair and a negative view of life, they do not directly state a personal desire to die or for life to end. They describe the *quality* of life as terrible, rather than expressing a wish for its cessation.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings of despair and past experiences of mistreatment. No current or future suicidal intentions or actions are mentioned.
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses significant general distress, sadness, and hopelessness. It describes a ""horrible life"" and feeling like there's ""no way out."" These are strong indicators of emotional suffering and potential risk factors.
    *   However, the post *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author*. There are no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't here,"" ""I'm going to end it all,"" or ""I hate living."" The despair is about the *quality* of life, not an explicit desire for its end.
    *   There is no mention of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted), plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
    *   Therefore, based on the definitions, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category as it captures the general distress and hopelessness without explicit suicidal ideation or action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm feeling suicidal,"" ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more,"" ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared,"" ""not able to deal,"" ""panic attacks,"" ""not able to sleep properly,"" ""feel like a burden.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquiring means for suicide are described. The alcohol/weed are the cause of the problem, not a method for suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** The post mentions being caught yesterday, but this is not a past *suicidal* action. No past attempts are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** The decision from management is due ""today,"" which is the immediate stressor. Suicidal thoughts are increasing, and suicide is seen as ""the only escape,"" indicating a current and strong desire.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear stated desire for life to end as an escape: ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide."" The suicidal thoughts are described as increasing, not as unwanted intrusions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" multiple times.
    *   Yes, it expresses a clear desire for life to end as an escape: ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide.""
    *   No, the writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. Instead, the thoughts are ""getting more and more,"" and suicide is presented as the ""only escape.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance (for suicide), or location is mentioned or strongly implied for a suicidal act.
    *   No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Despite high imminence and strong intent, there is no vague reference to an *action* or *how* the suicide would be carried out. The focus is on the distress and the idea of suicide as an escape, not the mechanics of it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past event (being caught yesterday) leading to current distress and future uncertainty (management decision today). The suicidal thoughts and desire are current.
    *   No specific, potentially lethal *suicidal* action initiated by the author is described, either past or very recent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a personal desire for suicide as an escape and explicit suicidal thoughts that are increasing. It's not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** There is clear suicidal ideation and desire to die (""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide""). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. The post describes the *feeling* and the *idea* of suicide as an escape, but not the *how*. Without any actionable component, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** There is no description of a past or very recent initiated suicidal action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses strong suicidal thoughts and a desire for suicide as an escape, but lacks any mention of a plan, method, or preparation. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The post describes a current, ongoing struggle with acting on suicidal thoughts and plans, despite past failures to complete the act. The desire is present now.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly expresses a desire to die (""I know the way I will end it,"" ""I am left wanting to jump,"" ""I know this is all I have left"") despite some ambivalence (""I really do not want to do this,"" ""I do not want to hurt the few people who love me""). The overall desire to die is strong and personal.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide ideation"" and phrases like ""end it,"" and ""my death.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/for life to end, despite the internal conflict (""I know this is all I have left"").
    *   While the writer states ""I really do not want to do this,"" this is presented as a struggle against a strong underlying desire, not an explicit negation of the desire itself. The desire to die is clearly present.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"") and location (train tracks) are mentioned.
    *   Yes, signs of preparation/knowledge are present (""I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past events and current/future intentions.
    *   Crucially, it describes *specific, potentially lethal actions* that were initiated by the author in the past:
        *   ""the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute."" This indicates initiated actions (getting to the point of jumping) that were self-interrupted.
        *   ""the first time I actually attempted."" This is an explicit, direct statement of a past suicide attempt by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong elements of 'Ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts, desire to die).
    *   It also contains strong elements of 'Behavior' (specific plan/method: ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink""; preparation/knowledge: ""know the train schedule pretty well,"" ""live really close to the tracks"").
    *   However, the post *also* explicitly describes past self-initiated actions that were potentially lethal: ""the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute"" and, most definitively, ""the first time I actually attempted.""
    *   According to the rules, ""'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present."" The author clearly describes past attempts.

Final decision is 'Attempt' due to the explicit mention of past initiated actions and attempts, which takes precedence over current ideation or behavior.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""People tell me I'm a burden."" This indicates feelings of worthlessness, being a burden, and likely despair or hopelessness. The description of not leaving the house, no job, living at home, and laying in bed all day points to severe social withdrawal, anhedonia, and a stagnant, possibly depressing, life situation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** Describes a long-term pattern of behavior (""Haven't left the house since I was 14""), but not a past suicidal action.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Not applicable, as there is no explicit desire to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, ongoing life situation and feelings (""I'm 23,"" ""I haven't left,"" ""I don't have,"" ""I still live,"" ""I lay"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness (""People tell me I'm a burden,"" describing a life of isolation and inactivity). These are strong indicators of mental health struggles and potential risk factors for suicide.
    *   However, the post *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author*. There are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or wanting life to end.
    *   There is no mention of any plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Since there is significant distress and hopelessness, but no explicit suicidal ideation, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category.

Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation. There's nothing there for me and nobody wants me to be there either. I don't even want to be there. I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life tbh",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""I don't know how much longer I can last.""
        *   ""I don't know how much longer I can hang on.""
        *   ""most people want me dead.""
        *   ""I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night."" (Direct mention of suicide, specific future timing/plan)
        *   ""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life tbh"" (Direct mention of a specific method of self-harm/suicide, and desire to end life)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hopelessness, despair, feeling unloved, isolated, trapped, and a significant burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""I can kill myself on graduation night."" (A specific time/event for a planned suicidal act).
        *   ""stick some knives through my stomach."" (A specific method).
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions past bullying and family issues, but no past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence:** The ""knives"" statement indicates a current strong desire with a specific method. The ""graduation night"" plan indicates a future, specific intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A clear and explicit desire to die and end life. No indication of unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to ""be done with life.""
    *   The writer does *not* state that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they are presented as a personal resolution or desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""knives through my stomach"") is mentioned.
    *   Yes, a specific future plan/timing (""kill myself on graduation night"") is mentioned.
    *   No explicit preparations (like writing a note or acquiring means) are mentioned beyond the stated plan and method. However, the presence of a specific method and a specific timing for a planned act is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and future intentions/plans (""kill myself on graduation night,"" ""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach"").
    *   It does *not* describe any past initiated, potentially lethal actions by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses explicit personal suicidal intent and desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts/desire by including a specific future plan (""kill myself on graduation night"") and a specific method (""stick some knives through my stomach""). This moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The combination of clear suicidal intent and the mention of a specific plan/method aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

I can't anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""commit"" (in the context of suicide), ""suicide notes,"" and ""tall bridges"" as a researched method/location. Also states ""I have a few methods to try.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""It's settled,"" ""can't anymore,"" ""no further help anywhere I can,"" ""doesn't seem to exist."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and a firm, decided state of mind.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:**
        *   ""spent the past few days researching tall bridges"" - This is research into a specific method/location.
        *   ""Decided to push through the holiday but commit when i get home"" - This is a clear future plan with a timeline.
        *   ""I have a few methods to try"" - Implies specific methods have been identified and considered.
        *   ""I've already drafted my suicide notes"" - This is a concrete preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The decision is ""settled,"" and preparations (research, drafting notes) are current. The act is planned for ""when I get home,"" indicating a firm, future intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A clear, firm desire to die and end life (""It's settled,"" ""commit,"" ""I can't anymore"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""commit"" (in context) and ""suicide notes.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""It's settled,"" ""I can't anymore.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite; the decision is firm and acted upon through preparation.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""tall bridges"" (researched location/method), ""a few methods to try"" (implies specific methods are identified).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""researched tall bridges"" and ""already drafted my suicide notes.""
    *   There is explicit desire to die, high imminence (firm decision, current preparations), and clear mention of method research and preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current preparations (""researched,"" ""drafted"") and a firm future intention (""commit when I get home"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent (""commit,"" ""suicide notes,"" ""can't anymore""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes significantly beyond mere thoughts or desire. It explicitly details research into methods/locations (""researching tall bridges""), mentions having ""a few methods to try,"" and describes a concrete preparation (""already drafted my suicide notes""). It also states a firm decision and timeline (""It's settled,"" ""commit when I get home"").
    *   These elements directly align with the definition of 'Behavior', which requires explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire *and* mention of a plan, specific method, intended action, or preparations.
    *   There is no description of a past *initiated action* (attempt), so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""end it all"" (multiple times), ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't"" (euphemism for suicide), ""Live or die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm free,"" ""blessing,"" ""weight off my chest"" – these indicate a sense of relief or resolution associated with the decision to end life, rather than distress about *unwanted* thoughts.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""looking into my options to end it all"" (planning/research)
        *   ""getting my ducks in a row"" (preparation)

    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions past *restraint* (""For years I felt like I couldn't kill myself because I had to 'stay alive for' my friends"") but no past *attempt*.
    *   **Imminence:** ""finally free,"" ""finally moving forward,"" ""could finally be my time"" – strong sense of progression towards action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to end life. The caveat ""Of course there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it"" is presented as a choice within the context of having the *option* to end it, not as a negation of the desire to act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""end it all,"" expressing a clear desire to die.
    *   The writer does *not* state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they embrace them as a ""blessing"" and a source of relief.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is named. However, the post clearly indicates active planning and preparation:
        *   ""looking into my options to end it all"" implies researching methods/plans.
        *   ""getting my ducks in a row"" is a direct statement of preparation.
        *   ""get cracking"" indicates an intention to proceed with action.
        *   The statement ""If I decide to end it I'll be sure to wish you all a farewell. Goodbye for now!"" is a very strong indicator of preparation for a final act, akin to writing a note or saying goodbyes.
    *   Given the high imminence and strong intent, these vague references to action and preparation are sufficient to move beyond Ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current planning and future intention (""finally free to end it all,"" ""looking into my options,"" ""once I'm ready to end it"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past. The reference to ""For years I felt like I couldn't kill myself"" describes past ideation and restraint, not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent, which is embraced, not unwanted.
    *   Not 'Ideation' because the post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires. It explicitly mentions active steps towards planning and preparation (""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" ""farewell"").
    *   It fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire AND mentions a plan (""looking into my options""), preparations (""getting my ducks in a row,"" ""farewell""), and an intended action (""get cracking"").
    *   Not 'Attempt' because no past initiated, potentially lethal action is described by the author.

Based on the analysis, the post describes active planning and preparation for suicide, which falls under 'Behavior'.

    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - There is no vague reference to an action that, coupled with high imminence, would imply a method or plan. The post focuses on the *desire* and the *frustration* of having that desire.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:

The fact that they ""couldn't cut"" means the action was interrupted or failed to proceed to completion, but it was still an initiated action with suicidal intent. This fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""I feel like I just need to do it"") and profound despair, ruling out 'Indicator'.

    - Writer's stated desire: The writer clearly states a desire to ""kill myself"" if they cannot feel loved. This is a personal desire to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:

These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** None are mentioned. ""I'm out"" is a statement of intent, but lacks any ""how.""
    *   **References to past actions:** The post contrasts past problem-solving (""putting a bandaid on a scratch or finding a way to get out of detention"") with the current ""thought of suicide,"" indicating the *thought* is the current, unsolvable problem. It does not describe any past self-initiated suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I'm out"" suggests immediate or near-future intent, but without a method, it remains a strong statement of desire. ""Now... it's the thought of suicide"" indicates current, ongoing ideation.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for life to end (""Fuck life, I'm out."") and explicit mention of ""the thought of suicide."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not want to act on them; rather, they are presented as an inescapable problem.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""the thought of suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""Fuck life, I'm out."" and the overall tone of profound despair and feeling life is unbearable.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer describes the ""thought of suicide"" as the current, unsolvable problem, implying it's a personal consideration, not an unwanted intrusion.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. ""I'm out"" is a strong statement of intent and implies action, but it lacks *any* indication of *how* that action would be taken. It's a declaration of leaving, not a description of the means. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a plan/method/preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and intentions (""I'm out,"" ""Now... it's the thought of suicide"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The comparison to past problem-solving does not describe a past suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to end life (""Fuck life, I'm out."") and explicitly mentions ""the thought of suicide."" This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. While ""I'm out"" expresses strong intent, it lacks the ""how"" or ""what"" to qualify as 'Behavior'. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations."" This is absent.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or preparation.

348,"To anyone that might read this. During lockdown here in Denmark, we had a long winter. I've always felt I've never done what I set out to do and never really connected with people. The lockdown and cold winter put everything that much more true. I've never felt as alone as I did there. I was very depressed, bored and lots of anxiety. Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write. Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful and even more so to the ones that's suffered so much. For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post mentions ""what if I wasn't in this world,"" ""gain peace,"" ""becoming suicidal,"" and ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""alone,"" ""very depressed,"" ""bored,"" ""lots of anxiety,"" ""couldn't sleep,"" ""scared me.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The author explicitly states, ""Never really thought I would act it out.""
    *   **References to past actions:** The post describes a past period (""During lockdown here... At some point my thoughts came to..."") where the author experienced suicidal thoughts and felt ""on the verge on becoming suicidal."" However, it clarifies that they ""Never really thought I would act it out."" This indicates no past initiated action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The content describes a past state. The current tone is reflective and advisory, offering hope and recommending a book to others with suicidal thoughts. There is no current or imminent intent expressed.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The author describes past thoughts of not being in this world, but immediately qualifies this by saying ""These thoughts scared me"" and ""Never really thought I would act it out."" The current message is one of overcoming distress and offering support to others, indicating a lack of current personal desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""becoming suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? It describes past thoughts of ""what if I wasn't in this world,"" but this is immediately followed by ""These thoughts scared me"" and ""Never really thought I would act it out."" The current message is explicitly positive and supportive (""Honestly, there is so much more to life... Life can be very beautiful..."").
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out."" This clearly indicates the thoughts were unwanted and not acted upon.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The author explicitly states they ""Never really thought I would act it out.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past period of distress and suicidal thoughts (""During lockdown... At some point my thoughts came to..."").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author. The author explicitly states they ""Never really thought I would act it out.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes past suicidal thoughts and a period of being ""on the verge of becoming suicidal.""
    *   Crucially, the author explicitly states that these thoughts ""scared me"" and that they ""Never really thought I would act it out."" This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die').""
    *   The overall tone of the post is reflective of a past struggle, now offering hope and advice to others who might be having suicidal thoughts, further reinforcing that the author is not currently experiencing a personal desire to die or suicidal intent.
    *   There is no current desire to die, no plan, no method, and no initiated action. Therefore, it does not fit Ideation (no current desire), Behavior (no plan/method/action), or Attempt (no initiated action).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""end myself again"", ""try to overdose"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""really depressed and sad atm"", ""idk what to do"", ""crying basically all night and now this morning"".
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** ""try to overdose"" is a specific method.
    *   **References to past actions:** The word ""again"" in ""end myself again"" and ""end it tonight again"" strongly implies a prior self-initiated suicidal action by the author.
    *   **Imminence:** ""tonight"".
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die (""gonna try to end myself"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""end myself"" is explicit.
    *   Yes, expresses a clear desire to die.
    *   No negation of these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""overdose"") is mentioned. This points towards 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current/future intention (""gonna try to end myself again tonight"").
    *   Crucially, the word ""again"" indicates a *past initiated action* by the author. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author... This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" The author is bringing up a past attempt (""again"") in the context of their current suicidal ideation and plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear suicidal intent and a specific plan for tonight (""try to overdose""), which would normally lead to 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the phrase ""end myself again"" is key. It indicates that the author has previously *initiated* a potentially lethal action. According to the rules, ""'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present."" The mention of a past attempt (""again"") by the author, linked to their current state and future intention, makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate classification.

My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""know they're dying,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all."" These are direct expressions of an anticipated end of life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""can't fight anymore,"" ""can't try anymore,"" ""so tired,"" ""life and its pain,"" ""tortured soul."" These indicate profound hopelessness, exhaustion, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None. There is no mention of how this ""end"" will come about, no tools, locations, substances, or preparatory actions (like writing notes).
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""in the next month or two"" suggests a timeframe, but it is not immediate (""tonight,"" ""now""). It's an expectation of an end, not an immediate plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for death as a release from pain (""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all""). The comparison to a dying cat also reinforces the idea of an accepted, impending end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes. Phrases like ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" and ""My death will release my pain"" clearly indicate a desire for life to cease.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the desire for death is presented as a desired outcome or an accepted inevitability, not an unwanted thought.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action...** The imminence (""next month or two"") is not high enough to infer a plan from vague statements, and there are no vague statements implying an action or method anyway. The post speaks of an *expected* end, not an *intended action* to bring it about.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes a future expectation (""coming to an end in the next month or two"") and current feelings of profound despair and resignation.
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post goes beyond general distress. It expresses a clear, personal desire for life to end and for death as a release from pain (""My death will release my pain""). This is a clear expression of suicidal intent, not just unwanted thoughts or general sadness. Therefore, it fits 'Ideation' better than 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** While there is clear ideation (desire for death), there is absolutely no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. The post describes an *expected* end, not a plan to *achieve* that end. Without any element of *how* or *preparation*, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** There is no description of any past or very recent initiated suicidal action.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire for death and an expectation of it, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation.

I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds .

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""ready to do it,"" and specifies ""lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Run out of options,"" ""hit rock bottom,"" ""feel like a complete failure,"" ""horrible and fake,"" ""overwhelming,"" ""can't bear the thought,"" ""last straw,"" ""feel awful,"" ""scared,"" ""pain I will cause,"" ""hope I can get the peace i need."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills."" This is a clear method and location. ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it"" indicates preparation and imminence.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions past mental breakdown and academic failure, but explicitly states ""never done anything like this before,"" meaning no past suicidal *actions*.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** Very high imminence: ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it,"" ""I'm ready to do it,"" ""It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom.""
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There's a clear desire to die/end life (""I'm ready to do it,"" ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""hope I can get the peace i need""). Although the writer says ""I feel awful because I don't want to do this,"" this is immediately qualified by ""but I've run out of options,"" indicating a strong, albeit conflicted, intent to act due to feeling trapped.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide is on my mind.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'm ready to do it,"" ""hope I can get the peace i need.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The statement ""I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options"" indicates internal conflict, but the overwhelming context and explicit plan show a current, strong desire to act. It's not a negation of the desire to die, but rather a lament about the necessity of the act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""knife and some pills"" (method/substance) and ""bathroom"" (location).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""about to lock myself in the bathroom.""
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The method here is explicit, not vague.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a very imminent future intention (""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it""). It also mentions past struggles but no past suicidal *actions*.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, the author states, ""I've never done anything like this before.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""suicide is on my mind,"" ""I'm ready to do it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post *also* includes a specific plan, method, and location (""lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills"") and indicates immediate intention (""about to lock myself""). This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' into 'Behavior'.
    *   The post describes an *intended, imminent action* with a plan, not a past completed or initiated action. The author explicitly states they have ""never done anything like this before."" Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the clear, explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific plan, method, and high imminence, the appropriate classification is 'Behavior'.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states ""I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day."" While no *specific* method is named, the act of *contemplating method* is a clear engagement with the 'how' of suicide. This is a step beyond just having suicidal thoughts.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""constantly round and round,"" ""over 100 times a day."" This indicates persistent, ongoing suicidal ideation and active engagement with methods.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses profound despair (""no interest in modern life,"" ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible"") and explicitly states the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""contemplate method."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not desire to act on them.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""no interest in modern life,"" combined with persistent suicidal thoughts and contemplation of method, implies a desire for life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the thoughts are presented as a constant, persistent presence (""constantly round and round"") and are actively engaged with (""contemplate method"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method is named (e.g., pills, gun). However, the phrase ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" is a direct engagement with the *means* of suicide. It indicates active consideration of *how* to carry out a suicidal act, even if the specific details are not shared. This goes beyond passive ideation.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The constant ""contemplat[ion of] method"" is a strong indicator of active planning, even if the method itself is vague or unstated. It signifies a focus on the practical aspect of suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/ongoing intention/state (""constantly round and round,"" ""over 100 times a day"").
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" clearly moves this beyond 'Indicator'. The thoughts are not described as unwanted; rather, they are constant and accompanied by active contemplation of methods.
    *   The phrase ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" is the critical element. This is not merely having suicidal thoughts ('Ideation'); it's actively engaging with the *how* (the method) of suicide. This active contemplation of means, even without specifying a particular method, constitutes a form of planning or engagement with the practicalities of a suicidal act. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes a mention of a plan/method/intended action, even if vague in its specific details, because the *act* of contemplating method is explicitly stated.
    *   There is no mention of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the analysis, the active and frequent ""contemplat[ion of] method"" indicates a step beyond just passive suicidal thoughts, moving into the realm of active engagement with the means of suicide.

I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE.

They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I jsut want to die.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to die is stated as a personal wish.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. There is no high imminence or vague reference to action beyond the general desire to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes extensive past trauma and current feelings of being trapped and wanting to die. The desire to die is a current feeling.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""I jsut want to die"") coupled with intense feelings of hopelessness and being trapped. This goes beyond general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die and suicidal ideation. However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out a suicidal act. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   Because there is no plan, method, or intended action, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   Because there is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated suicidal action, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Ideation'.

354,I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm a fuck up who can never get anything right. I feel like my mom thinks I'm a genuinely stupid human being who can't think for herself. I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree. I want to tell a suicide hotline but I don't want to be locked up in a mental facility and never be able to get out. I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/suicide/self-harm: ""suicide hotline"" is mentioned, indicating the context of suicide. The phrase ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a clear, specific, and lethal method of self-harm/suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what to do,"" ""I feel like I'm a fuck up,"" ""can never get anything right,"" ""genuinely stupid human being,"" ""can't think for herself."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, low self-worth, and despair.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a specific method and a contemplated action.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving..."" indicates immediate contemplation and high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: The contemplation of driving into a tree at 100 mph clearly indicates a desire for life to end or to die. The hesitation about calling a hotline is due to fear of consequences (""locked up""), not a negation of the suicidal thoughts themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (in ""suicide hotline"") and expresses a clear desire to die through the contemplation of a specific lethal action (""driving 100 mph into a tree"").
    - The writer does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. The thoughts are presented as a current, active contemplation.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Yes, a specific method (""driving 100 mph into a tree"") is mentioned. This is a clear indication of a plan/method.
    - There are no explicit signs of preparation beyond the immediate contemplation and presence in the car. However, the specificity of the method and the ""right now"" context, coupled with clear intent, is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current contemplation/intention for a future action (""I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving..."").
    - It does not describe a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and a desire to die through the contemplation of a lethal act. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post includes a specific method (""driving 100 mph into a tree"") and an intended action, which moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'. The imminence (""right now"") further supports this.
    - There is no description of a past initiated attempt.
    - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts/desire coupled with a specific method/intended action.

355,"I did a horrible thing to the woman I love. We started off a bit complicated, my mum is dying from cancer and at the start I told her that I cant commit to a relationship because I wasn't in the right headspace. That was fine at first but she wanted more and so did i. But I was weak and looked for comfort in an ex. I put a stop to it again and again but everytime something got hard with my family I kept running to the other woman for support. I knew it was wrong and I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much. We were together for two years. But she found out about the previous incident and left. I am fully responsible for everything that happened. Im so regretful and sorry for hurting her. My mum is in her final couple of weeks, im her primary carer and I dont know how to process any of it. She will be leaving my little brother who is autistic in my care. I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously. I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""my mum is dying from cancer"" (external, not self-harm)
        *   ""I've struggled with suicide before."" (direct mention of past suicide struggle)
        *   ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" (direct mention of past hospitalization related to suicide)
        *   ""I dont see any future ahead for me."" (hopelessness, lack of future)
        *   ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well."" (clear intent to die by suicide, linked to mother's death)
        *   ""im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing"" (clear future intention of dying by suicide, acknowledging impact)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""horrible thing,"" ""weak,"" ""hated myself so much,"" ""hate myself so much,"" ""regretful,"" ""sorry for hurting her,"" ""don't know how to process any of it,"" ""struggled,"" ""scared,"" ""regret."" (High levels of guilt, self-loathing, hopelessness, fear, regret).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned for the *current* suicidal thoughts.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."" This strongly implies a past initiated suicidal action or a severe crisis that led to hospitalization, which is typically due to an attempt or serious intent/plan.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""once my mum passes I will be joining her as well"" (links future suicidal action to an imminent event - mum's final couple of weeks). ""I will cause with my passing"" (future action).
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die (""joining her,"" ""my passing"") and lack of future vision.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""I've struggled with suicide before"" explicitly mentions suicide.
    *   Yes, ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well"" and ""im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing"" express a clear desire to die and an intention for life to end.
    *   No negation of desire; the desire is clearly expressed as personal intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for the *current* suicidal intent. The desire is present, but the *how* is absent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past events and future intentions.
    *   **Past:** ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."" Being hospitalized ""for it"" (suicide) indicates a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action or a severe crisis that was treated as such. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""A concrete, potentially life-threatening action by the author must have been *initiated*."" Hospitalization for suicide is a strong indicator of such an initiated action.
    *   **Future:** ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing."" This indicates future suicidal intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses current suicidal ideation (""I don't see any future,"" ""I will be joining her,"" ""my passing""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   While there's no specific plan/method for the *current* ideation, which would typically lead to 'Ideation', the post explicitly mentions a past initiated action: ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" This phrase, in the context of ""struggled with suicide before,"" strongly indicates a past suicide attempt or a severe suicidal crisis that required hospitalization as an intervention for a potentially lethal action.
    *   The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes **past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal...**"" and ""This includes attempts described as historical... if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" The author is bringing up past hospitalization for suicide in the context of their current despair and suicidal thoughts.
    *   The rule "" 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present"" applies here.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states, ""I wake up even more tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" These phrases strongly imply a desire to end life or the current state of suffering, which is a form of suicidal ideation. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My mind is hell,"" ""losing,"" ""painful,"" ""nothing changes,"" ""worse thoughts,"" ""eating my mind,"" ""tear me down every night,"" ""feel so stupid,"" ""feel so weak,"" ""so hopeless."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, and mental exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. There's no mention of tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquiring means.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions (attempts) are mentioned. The post refers to past efforts to cope (therapy, medication, new activities) but not past suicidal acts.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" indicates a high degree of imminence regarding the intention to end the suffering, implying an impending action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a clear desire for the suffering to end, leading to the conclusion of ending life (""tired of living,"" ""stop it""). This is not about unwanted thoughts, but a personal desire to end the current state.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   However, it expresses a clear desire for life to end or to not be alive: ""I wake up even more tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" In the context of the overwhelming despair described, ""stop it"" clearly refers to ending the unbearable existence.
    *   The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they seem to be a conclusion reached due to the intensity of suffering.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   While ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" implies an intended action, there is absolutely no indication of *how* this action will be carried out (no method, no plan, no specific type of action beyond the general idea of ""stopping it""). The definition for Behavior requires some form of explicit planning or intended action element like a specific method, tools, locations, or preparations. Without any of these, it falls short of Behavior.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a future intention (""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"").
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to end life/suffering (""tired of living,"" ""stop it"") and profound hopelessness, moving beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of wanting life to end and strong suicidal thoughts/feelings (""I wake up even more tired of living,"" ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it""). This fits the 'Ideation' definition.
    *   While there is high imminence (""I don't have much time left""), there is *no* specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The phrase ""stop it"" is an intention to act, but it lacks any detail about *how* that action will be carried out, which is crucial for 'Behavior'. The rule states: ""If there is genuine uncertainty about any plan, method, or intended action even after considering context, imminence, and intent, choose 'Ideation'."" Given the complete absence of method/plan, it remains 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses strong suicidal ideation with high imminence, but lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide and be depressed."" It also says, ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't want to anymore"" (repeated), ""I hate cooking, I hate cleaning, I hate taking care of myself,"" ""tired and exhausted,"" ""fucked up my brain,"" ""don't know where I want to go and what future I may or may not have,"" ""don't know anything anymore,"" ""depressed."" These convey profound hopelessness, anhedonia, despair, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** The author mentions ""I tried making some art and I just got tired and exhausted,"" which is not a suicidal action. There are no mentions of past suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence:** ""constantly contemplate suicide"" indicates ongoing thoughts, not immediate intent. ""I hope I'll get out of this soon. But maybe I won't. And that's life too."" suggests a lack of immediate plan or definitive decision.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""constantly contemplate suicide"" clearly indicates suicidal ideation. ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" expresses a desire for non-existence. ""I don't want to anymore"" in the context of the entire post, especially with the mention of suicide, implies a desire for an end to their current suffering/existence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""constantly contemplate suicide.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all."" This expresses a clear desire for non-existence. The repeated ""I don't want to anymore"" combined with the contemplation of suicide reinforces this.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. While they express a hope to ""get out of this soon,"" they do not negate the personal desire to contemplate suicide or the feeling that it would be ""better for me to not be here at all.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Imminence is not high here (""constantly contemplate,"" ""hope I'll get out of this soon""), and there is no vague reference to an action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and ongoing contemplation of suicide.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""constantly contemplate suicide"") and a desire for non-existence (""Would've been better for me to not be here at all""). This clearly fits the definition of 'Ideation' and rules out 'Indicator' because there is clear personal suicidal intent/ideation, and it's not explicitly stated as unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action by the author. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post directly asks ""When to know if suicide is better."" It also refers to ""the release is better as their life is a bust,"" which implies a desire for death as an escape.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user lists a history of trauma, OCD, anhedonia, no friends, and abuse, stating ""all I have is that."" This indicates profound despair, hopelessness, and a feeling that life is not worth living (""life is a bust"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. There is no indication of a specific way the user intends to act, nor any preparations.
    *   **References to past actions:** The user mentions living with trauma/conditions since age 12/13, but there is no mention of past *suicidal actions* or attempts.
    *   **Imminence:** The question ""When to know if suicide is better"" suggests contemplation rather than immediate intent to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The user is asking if others ""feel like the release is better as their life is a bust,"" indicating a personal consideration of suicide as a desirable outcome for their situation. This is not framed as an unwanted thought.

    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end (""the release is better as their life is a bust"").

    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current contemplation and a long history of suffering.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""When to know if suicide is better"") and a desire for life to end (""the release is better as their life is a bust""). This clearly moves it beyond 'Indicator', as the desire for suicide/death is personally expressed and not stated as unwanted.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""I wanna go sleep forever"" is a clear euphemism for wanting to die. ""Can't take this shit no more I'm sick and tired of my shitty life"" expresses extreme despair and a desire for life to end.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, exhaustion with life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I have 58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg"" is a very specific mention of a large quantity of medications, indicating a clear method (overdose) and the means readily available.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** The language ""I wanna go sleep forever"" and ""can't take this shit no more"" combined with the immediate possession of the means (""I have..."") suggests high imminence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I wanna go sleep forever"" is a strong, unambiguous expression of wanting to die.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I wanna go sleep forever"" and ""can't take this shit no more I'm sick and tired of my shitty life.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly present and personal.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I have..."" indicates the means are acquired and readily available, which is a form of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention (""I wanna go sleep forever"") and the current possession of the means.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by explicitly mentioning a specific method (overdose of specific medications) and the immediate availability of the means (""I have...""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes a plan/method/preparation.

    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to die,"" ""I'm tired of being alive.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as personal.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Imminence is not high, and no vague reference to action is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire to die.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I'm tired of being alive"") and profound despair. This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide, and the desire is not stated as unwanted. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die but does *not* mention any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does not describe any past or very recent self-initiated potentially lethal actions. This distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    *   Given the explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die without any specific plan, method, or action, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** ""tried and bailed out multiple times,"" ""don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""tried with a knife. It didn't work,"" ""I have a rope,"" ""There's a building,"" ""I have to do it,"" ""I should've done it a long time ago,"" ""I want this to end.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I hate myself so much,"" ""I am scared.""
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:**
        *   ""tried with a knife. It didn't work."" (Past initiated action/method)
        *   ""I have a rope."" (Current means/tool)
        *   ""There's a building"" (Considered location)
        *   ""I never checked out the place."" (Incomplete preparation for building, but rope is present)
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times,"" ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" These are explicit descriptions of past initiated actions.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have to do it."" (High imminence of intent to act).
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have to do it,"" ""I want this to end."" (Clear desire for life to end/to die). ""I am scared"" indicates internal conflict but does not negate the desire to act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"": No, but strong implicit intent through phrases like ""I have to do it,"" ""I want this to end,"" and the context of past actions and current means.
    *   Clear desire to die/for life to end: Yes. ""I want this to end,"" ""I have to do it.""
    *   Explicitly unwanted thoughts: No, the writer expresses a desire to *not* bail out anymore, indicating a desire to follow through.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Specific method/tool/location mentioned: Yes, ""a knife"" (past), ""a rope"" (current means), ""a building"" (considered location).
    *   Signs of preparation: ""I have a rope"" indicates possession of a means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Describes a past event, current/future intention, or both? Both.
    *   Past: ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times,"" ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" These are clear descriptions of *initiated, potentially lethal actions* by the author in the past.
    *   Current/Future: ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have a rope,"" ""I have to do it."" (Current intent and means).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear expressions of current suicidal ideation and intent (""I want this to end,"" ""I have to do it"").
    *   It also mentions current means (""I have a rope"") and consideration of a location (""There's a building""), which would typically point towards 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the post explicitly describes *past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions* by the author: ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times,"" and specifically, ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work.""
    *   According to the rules, the 'Attempt' category definition states: ""The content describes **past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal...** This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles.""
    *   Furthermore, the rule states: ""**'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author**, even if current ideation/behavior is also present.""
    *   Since the post clearly describes past initiated actions (""tried with a knife""), the classification should be 'Attempt'.

A fly is worth more than i am. all they do is look for food and reproduce, i cant even do that. im useless.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""I just want to end it."" This clearly implies ending life.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Tired of it,"" ""No point to anything in life with depression,"" ""I feel pain,"" ""useless,"" ""most useless pos known to mankind,"" ""A fly is worth more than i am."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and anhedonia.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence: ""I just want to end it"" is a current desire, but no specific timeframe for an *action* is given.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire for life to end (""I just want to end it"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I just want to end it"" is a very strong and direct expression of wanting life to cease.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just want to end it"" and ""No point to anything in life"" clearly express a desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is personal and current.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Here, ""I just want to end it"" is a desire, not an action or plan. There's no indication of *how* they would end it, or any form of action being taken or planned, even vaguely.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to end life (""I just want to end it,"" ""No point to anything in life""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    - The post expresses a desire to die/end life, which fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out the desire. If there were, it would be 'Behavior'. Since there isn't, it remains 'Ideation'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The core of the post is the profound desire to end life due to pain and hopelessness, without any concrete steps towards acting on it.

363,"Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow. But I will, as always. Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again. Tired of being alone.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Key elements: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" (desire for death), ""Tired of being alone"" (emotional indicator, despair), ""Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"" (future conditional intent, reference to past action).
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""won't wake up tomorrow"" (desire to die), ""attempt properly again"" (explicit reference to suicide attempt).
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, loneliness (""Tired of being alone,"" ""depressed"").
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None for the immediate ""won't wake up tomorrow."" For the future ""attempt properly again,"" no method is specified, but the word ""attempt"" implies an action.
    - References to past actions: ""attempt properly again"" clearly indicates a past initiated suicide attempt by the author.
    - Imminence: ""tomorrow"" (for not waking up), ""Christmas"" (for potential future attempt).
    - Stated desire: There is a clear desire to die (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"") and a conditional future intention to act (""attempt properly again"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" expresses a clear desire to die.
    - Yes, ""attempt properly again"" explicitly refers to a suicidal act.
    - The writer does not explicitly state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - For the immediate desire (""won't wake up tomorrow""), no plan/method is mentioned.
    - For the future intention (""attempt properly again""), no specific method/plan is mentioned, but the word ""attempt"" implies an action. However, this is more about the *past* action and a *future conditional* intent, not a current plan being executed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" describes a future wish.
    - ""Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"" describes a future conditional intention.
    - The most critical part is ""attempt properly again."" This describes a *past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action* by the author. The word ""again"" confirms it was a previous attempt. This fits the definition of 'Attempt' as it describes a past initiated action by the author, brought up in the context of their current feelings and potential future actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains elements of 'Ideation' (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" - desire to die).
    - It also contains a future conditional intent that might lean towards 'Behavior' if a plan were present (""attempt properly again"" in the future context).
    - However, the phrase ""attempt properly again"" explicitly describes a *past initiated action* by the author. According to the definitions, 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation or future behavior is also present. The post directly refers to the author having made a suicide attempt in the past.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""kill me,"" ""chop me up,"" and ""hide my body."" These are direct mentions of death and specific, violent methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** While not explicitly stated emotions like ""hopelessness,"" the desperate plea to be killed and hidden implies extreme despair and a desire to cease existing.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user is ""looking for someone to kill me and hide my body,"" and is ""happy for u to chop me up."" This constitutes a very specific method and a desired outcome (not being found). While the execution is sought from another person, the plan and method are clearly articulated by the author.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** The phrase ""I am looking for someone to kill me"" suggests a current, active, and urgent desire to act on these thoughts.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a very clear and explicit desire for life to end, expressed through the direct request for someone to kill them and dispose of their body.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""kill me"" is a direct expression of the desire to die.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, ""I am looking for someone to kill me and hide my body... I am happy for u to chop me up as long as i never get found again"" unequivocally expresses a desire for life to end and to disappear.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the author is actively seeking to fulfill this desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act?** Yes, the method is ""kill me"" and ""chop me up,"" with the additional detail of ""hide my body."" This is a specific, albeit extreme, method of ending life.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The act of ""looking for someone"" to carry out the act can be considered a form of preparation or active step towards implementing the plan.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context.** The desire is present, and the request for ""someone to kill me"" is a direct statement of intended action, with a specified method (""chop me up"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes a current intention (""I am looking for someone to kill me"") for a future action.
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It not only expresses a desire to die but also outlines a specific method (""kill me,"" ""chop me up"") and is actively seeking to implement this plan (""looking for someone""). This presence of a plan/method and active seeking moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The combination of explicit suicidal intent, a specified method, and an active step (seeking assistance) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fed up,"" ""fighting down,"" ""rock bottom lows,"" ""no desire to die,"" ""consider it.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""going on 10 years that I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts."" This refers to a long-standing internal struggle, not a past initiated action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""Every fucking day,"" ""some days I consider it."" This indicates persistence of thoughts.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I have no desire to die."" This is a very strong and explicit statement. It is followed by ""But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it."" This nuance suggests that the *consideration* is born out of exhaustion from fighting *unwanted* thoughts, rather than a genuine desire to die. The primary sentiment remains fighting the thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No, the post explicitly states, ""I have no desire to die."" While ""fantasizing about my death"" and ""some days I consider it"" are present, the explicit negation of desire (""I have no desire to die"") and the context of ""fighting to suppress them"" indicates these are *unwanted* thoughts or a consideration born from exhaustion of the fight, not a genuine personal desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I fight to suppress them,"" and ""I have no desire to die."" This is a key point.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a long-standing (10 years) internal struggle with current, daily unwanted thoughts.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. ""Fighting down suicidal thoughts"" is an internal process, not an initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly states ""I have no desire to die"" and ""I fight to suppress them."" This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die**.""
    *   The ""fantasizing about my death"" and ""some days I consider it"" are presented as part of the *unwanted* thoughts the author is fighting, or as a consequence of being ""fed up with fighting this crap,"" rather than a genuine, active desire to die. The explicit negation of desire takes precedence.
    *   There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   'Ideation' is ruled out because the author explicitly states ""I have no desire to die,"" which contradicts the core of Ideation (a clear personal expression of desire to die).

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""problems are getting worse,"" ""struggling more and more,"" ""depressed,"" ""unimportant,"" ""sad,"" ""envious,"" ""no more options."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and a sense of burden/worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None. Crucially, the post explicitly states: ""The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest. I don't know why, but I just. can't."" This is a direct negation of ability to act or form a plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** The desire to end life is present and ongoing (""Every day, I'm struggling more and more,"" ""don't have any more options here""). However, the explicit inability to harm self negates imminence of *action*.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal wish to ""end my life"" and ""end all this."" This is a genuine desire for life to end, despite the stated inability to act on it.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""wish to end my life,"" ""end all this.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""wish to end my life,"" ""end all this.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states they *cannot* harm themselves, not that they *do not want* to end their life. The desire to die is present and personal. This leans away from 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest,"" which is a clear absence of a plan, method, or intended action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a current desire/intention, but explicitly states an inability to act.
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, personal expressions of a desire to die (""wish to end my life,"" ""end all this""). This rules out 'Indicator', as the desire is personal and not described as unwanted thoughts.
    *   Despite the strong desire to die, the post explicitly states, ""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest. I don't know why, but I just. can't."" This explicitly negates the presence of any plan, method, or intended action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of any past self-initiated potentially lethal action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Given the clear suicidal ideation (desire to die) without any plan, method, or intended action (and an explicit statement of inability to act), 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** No explicit mentions of these.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I lost control,"" ""I've lost control of my head,"" ""I just want to cry,"" ""I can't breathe,"" ""I want to scream help please,"" ""I don't want to live this again."" These indicate extreme distress, emotional overwhelm, hopelessness, and a profound desire for the current state of suffering to end.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I don't want to live this again"" implies a past experience of similar intense distress or a crisis, but it does not describe a past *initiated suicidal action*.
    *   **Imminence:** The language (""I just want to cry,"" ""I can't breathe"") suggests immediate, acute distress. ""I don't want to live this again"" speaks to a desire for the current suffering to cease.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I don't want to live this again"" is a strong expression of not wanting to continue experiencing the current state of life/suffering. While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" it is a profound rejection of continued existence under current conditions, which is a form of wanting life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** ""I don't want to live this again"" is a strong expression of wanting the current experience of life to cease. This falls under ""profound expressions of wanting life to end"" as per the Ideation definition.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, there is no negation of desire; rather, there is a clear desire for the current painful experience of life to end.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a vague reference to action implying a method or plan? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current intense distress and a future desire for the current suffering to end.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. ""I don't want to live this again"" refers to the *experience* of distress, not a past *attempted action*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" is a profound expression of wanting the current suffering to end, which implies a desire for life to end in its current state. This goes beyond general distress and aligns with the Ideation definition's ""profound expressions of wanting life to end."" There is no explicit statement that suicidal thoughts are unwanted.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Attempt.

    Based on the strong expression of wanting the current life/suffering to end, without any explicit plan or past initiated action, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex. It's this fucking sickness god it's horrible it's so goddamn horrible and I don't why this is happening to me. Of course I get my ex doesn't care about me and didn't care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isn't just my problem my trauma it's this sickness I've been carrying from before I even met her. And I'm tired because I'm a good person I know it's wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesn't listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship. I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it. And my mom didn't even tell my brother the whole truth. They can't keep hiding it and brushing it off. It's not helping!,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex."" ""I decided this is it.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""It's too hard,"" ""This is too hard,"" ""horrible,"" ""tired,"" ""keeps getting worse."" High levels of distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" This is a clear preparation for a suicidal act. ""decided this is it"" indicates a firm decision to end life.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past *suicidal attempts* are mentioned. The ""note"" is a current/recent preparation.
    *   **Imminence:** ""decided this is it"" suggests a current, firm decision, and the note has already been left. This implies high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, explicit desire to die (""reason to die,"" ""decided this is it"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not those exact words, but ""reason to die"" and ""decided this is it"" are very strong and direct expressions of suicidal intent and desire to end life.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, unequivocally, through ""reason to die"" and ""decided this is it.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a clear desire and has taken a preparatory action.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific *method* (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" Leaving a suicide note is a definite sign of preparation.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While no method is stated, the act of leaving a note *is* a preparation for a specific action, indicating the intent to carry out a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""decided this is it"") and a recent preparation (""I left a note""). The note *has been left*, indicating the decision and preparation are complete or ongoing.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, there is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). The note is a preparation for an action, not the action itself.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""reason to die,"" ""decided this is it""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts/desire by mentioning a concrete preparation: ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" This specific preparation moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past *initiated lethal action* by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'. The note is a preparation for a future act, not a description of a past attempt.
    *   Therefore, the presence of clear suicidal intent combined with a specific preparation (leaving a note) fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore. What's the point of life when you can't even carry your own weight? I just want to be normal. How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since."" (Past and ongoing desire to die).
        *   ""fired for being suicidal"" (Past state of being suicidal).
        *   ""I just. Want. To die."" (Clear, explicit, current desire to die).
        *   ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" (Explicit question about a method for suicide, indicating a search for a specific means/plan).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, self-loathing (""unstable freak,"" ""creep,"" ""short ugly bastard""), burden (""don't want to be a burden anymore""), loneliness, inability to cope (""I can't keep doing this anymore""), anhedonia (""almost nothing is interesting"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" is a direct inquiry into a specific type of method or plan. While not a chosen method, it indicates an active search for a means to an end, which is a component of planning. It's not just ""I want to die,"" but ""How do I *do* it?"".
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions past suicidal ideation (""screamed that I wanted to die"" in middle school) and being ""fired for being suicidal"" (a past state). No mention of a past *attempt* (an initiated lethal action).
    *   **Imminence:** ""I just. Want. To die."" and ""I can't keep doing this anymore"" combined with the direct question about *how* to kill oneself suggests high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I just. Want. To die.""). This is not about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""I just. Want. To die."" and ""How do I kill myself"".
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    *   No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; they are clearly desired.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method is not chosen, but the post actively seeks information about a method: ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body..."" This is a clear step towards identifying a plan or method, moving beyond mere ideation. It's a direct question about execution.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past ideation (""Middle school... wanted to die"") and current/future intention (""I just. Want. To die."" and the question about *how* to kill oneself).
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past. The ""screamed that I wanted to die"" is ideation, not an attempt. Being ""fired for being suicidal"" indicates a state, not a specific initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts or desire by actively inquiring about *how* to commit suicide, specifically seeking a method that avoids leaving a body. This search for a method or plan, even if not fully formed, constitutes an element of 'Behavior'. It's not just ""I want to die,"" but ""How do I do it?"". This active search for means, coupled with strong intent and imminence, aligns with 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so 'Attempt' is not the primary classification.

A lot of times I feel like I wasn't meant for this world. I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy. My view of the world is growing more and more dim and I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is. Everything here is lame and it just makes me sick and I don't really see a future for myself. In the end, I'm just going to keep disappointing those who care till everyone hates me. One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""No point in it all,"" ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""I won't get anywhere in life,"" ""I feel like I wasn't meant for this world,"" ""question what the point of moving on is,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" These phrases strongly indicate a desire for life to end and an intention to bring about that end.
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""No point in it all,"" ""won't get anywhere,"" ""no future""), despair (""trapped in limbo,"" ""view of the world is growing more and more dim,"" ""everything here is lame""), feeling like a burden (""keep disappointing those who care till everyone hates me"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No explicit method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note) is mentioned. However, ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""One last push is all I need,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" imply an intended action to end life, rather than just passively wishing for it.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""One last push is all I need,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" This suggests a desire for an imminent end and an intention to act.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and strong desire for life to end and an intention to bring about that end personally.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. Phrases like ""No point in it all,"" ""I wasn't meant for this world,"" ""question what the point of moving on is,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" all convey a strong desire for life to end.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is expressed; there is a desire to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific method is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The desire to die is strong, and the imminence is high (""one last push,"" ""no point in waiting for it to come naturally""). The phrases ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""One last push is all I need,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" clearly indicate an *intended action* to end life, rather than just passive ideation. The ""push over the edge"" is a metaphor for a decisive, final action. The statement ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" explicitly states an intention to *intervene* and cause death, rather than waiting for natural processes. This goes beyond mere thoughts or desires and indicates an intent to act, even if the specific method is vague.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of mind and a future intention to act.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire for life to end and a lack of future, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - The phrases ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" indicate a clear intention to *act* to bring about death. While a specific method is not detailed, the explicit stated intention to take a ""push"" and not wait for death to ""come naturally"" signifies an intended action. This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition: ""mentions... an intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence)."" The imminence is high (""one last push"").
    - There is no description of a past initiated attempt.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Behavior'.

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""People who commit suicide"" is present.
    - Emotional indicators: ""painful emotions,"" ""snap and break down."" These describe a general process for *people*, not necessarily the author's current state.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: ""we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves."" This uses ""we"" in a general, collective sense, referring to how people in general might reach a certain point, not a personal past suicidal action by the author.
    - Imminence: None.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is making a general statement about the nature and causes of suicide in others, expressing empathy and understanding. There is no personal expression of a desire to die or suicidal intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""commit suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The mention of ""suicide"" is in a third-person, explanatory context, not a first-person expression of intent.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as personal suicidal thoughts are not expressed.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a general process that leads *people* to suicide, not a personal past or future action of the author.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The ""we"" is collective, not personal.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post discusses suicide in a general, empathetic, and explanatory manner, focusing on the psychological process that can lead *people* to it.
    - There is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past attempt by the author.
    - The use of ""we"" is a collective ""we,"" referring to humanity or people who struggle, not a personal ""I"" expressing suicidal intent or experience.
    - It lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.
    - Therefore, it falls under 'Indicator' as it discusses suicide abstractly or generally, without personal suicidal intent from the author.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""If I kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever,"" and ""I'd be dead.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The primary emotion is anger, resentment, and defiance (""fuck everyone I knew,"" ""I don't owe anybody shit,"" ""giant middle finger,"" ""I ain't having any of their shit""). This is a strong negative emotional state linked to suicidal ideation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, bridge), or preparation (e.g., writing a physical note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The ""giant middle finger"" is a symbolic final act, not a method of suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** The phrasing ""If I kill myself"" implies a conditional thought, but the overall tone suggests a strong desire for this outcome. There is no immediate imminence like ""tonight"" or ""now.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire expressed to ""kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""If I kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just wanna leave a giant middle finger before I leave this world forever and people will know I ain't having any of their shit. I don't owe anybody anything and if they have a problem with that too bad because I'd be dead."" This clearly indicates a desire for life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly personal and expressed.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The ""giant middle finger"" is a symbolic statement, not a physical preparation for suicide.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Imminence is not high, and there is no vague reference to *how* the act would be carried out.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future, conditional intention.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""If I kill myself,"" ""leave this world forever""). This rules out 'Indicator' as there is clear personal suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations being taken. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states: ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live."" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of having to live,"" ""frustrated,"" ""demoralising,"" ""fucked up majorly,"" ""constant feeling of dread and anxiety,"" ""I hate it,"" ""feel no connection,"" ""feel nothing anymore,"" ""Just frustration,"" ""can't motivate myself,"" ""constant state of anxiety and/or depression,"" ""It won't leave me alone,"" ""I can't fucking function in this world."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, and severe distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The statement ""Dead"" is an outcome, not a method or plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** No references to past suicidal actions or attempts are present.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The phrase ""tired of having to live"" indicates a current state of desire for life to end. ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" is a future projection, but it reflects a current desire for that outcome. While not immediate, the overall sentiment of despair and inability to function is very high.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and explicit desire for life to end (""tired of having to live,"" ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead""). These are presented as the author's own feelings and desires, not as unwanted intrusive thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live."" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" clearly express a desire for life to end or for the author to not be alive. ""I can't fucking function in this world"" also strongly implies this.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire to be ""dead"" and ""tired of having to live"" is presented as the author's genuine personal desire and feeling, not as something unwanted.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While the desire is high, there is no reference, vague or otherwise, to an action or method. ""Dead"" is an outcome, not an action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a future desired outcome (""dead in five years"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. There is no mention of any past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, personal expressions of a desire for life to end (""tired of having to live,"" ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead""). This goes beyond general distress and indicates a personal suicidal desire. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   While there is a strong desire to die/not be alive, there is absolutely no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying it out. The statement ""Dead"" is a desired state or outcome, not a description of how that state will be achieved. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of any past or very recent initiated suicidal action by the author. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer, or profound expressions of wanting life to end... but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.""

However, the crucial qualifier ""(Asking for a personal reason)"" indicates that this is not a purely abstract or philosophical question. It strongly implies that the author is personally grappling with the desire to ""kill their self"" or the underlying pain that would lead to such a desire. The question is a reflection of their own internal state or thoughts, rather than just observing others.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill their self.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While phrased as a question about ""someone,"" the ""personal reason"" disclaimer strongly suggests the author is personally experiencing or contemplating the desire to ""kill their self"" to ""end their pain."" This implies a personal suicidal intent or ideation, even if not stated as ""I want to die.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, there is no negation of the thoughts or desire. The ""personal reason"" suggests the opposite, that these thoughts are relevant to the author.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a vague reference to action implying a method or plan with high imminence? No, there is no high imminence and no specific action beyond the general ""kill their self.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It's a present-tense question, but the ""personal reason"" makes it relevant to the author's current internal state. No past actions are described.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly mentions ""kill their self"" and links it to ""end their pain."" The critical element is ""(Asking for a personal reason),"" which transforms a hypothetical question into a strong indication of personal suicidal ideation. The author is not merely expressing general distress or unwanted thoughts; they are exploring the concept of suicide from a personally relevant standpoint.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The explicit mention of ""kill their self"" in a personally relevant context goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion, distinguishing it from 'Indicator'. While phrased as a question, the personal connection makes it a clear expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings.

Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it includes explicit personal (implied by ""personal reason"") expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""kill their self,"" ""end their pain"") without any specific plan, method, or intended action.

So some how she convince me not to. Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday faking everything I do and every hour on till I go to sleep suicide by a train is on my mind.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I been suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind,"" ""I'm planning on doing it,"" ""put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me."" Also, a past thought: ""thought jumping in and drowning.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depressed and waking up everyday faking everything I do and every hour on till I go to sleep.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   Method: ""suicide by a train,"" ""put neck on the train tracks.""
        *   Plan: ""I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday.""
        *   Preparation/Research: ""So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"" (seeking information related to the plan's effectiveness).
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning... So some how she convince me not to."" This describes a past *thought* or *intention* that was *not initiated* due to intervention. It was not an attempt.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" - A specific future date, indicating a concrete, albeit not immediate, plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die, expressed through ""I been suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind,"" and ""I'm planning on doing it.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicide by a train"" and ""I'm planning on doing it.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die and for life to end.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they are planning them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""train,"" ""put neck on the train tracks"") is mentioned.
    *   Yes, there are signs of preparation/planning: ""I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday,"" and asking about the lethality of the chosen method.
    *   This clearly indicates a plan/method/preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a past event (thinking about drowning at age 10-11) and a current/future intention (""Now I'm 16... planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"").
    *   The past event (""I thought jumping in and drowning... she convince me not to"") explicitly states that the action was *not initiated* due to intervention. Therefore, it does not describe a past *initiated* potentially lethal action.
    *   The current/future intention describes a plan for a specific date, not a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** There is clear, personal suicidal intent and desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Not Attempt:** The past event described was a thought/intention that was *not initiated* (""she convince me not to""). There is no description of a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire to die. It includes a specific plan (""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday""), a specific method (""suicide by a train,"" ""put neck on the train tracks""), and research into the method's effectiveness. This combination of explicit intent, specific method, and defined plan fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

376,"Triggered by an attempt of someone else. I´ve had some suicidal thoughts through my life,  but most of them are behind me. I had a few rougher weeks lately and heard that someone who I know tried to end his life. Since then I keep thinking about it. It used to be something that wasn´t that ""real"" something I would think about, but it seemed more unattainable. It´s like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try. I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""tried to end his life"" (referring to someone else), ""keep thinking about it,"" ""it's now ok to try"" (referring to suicide as a possibility for self).
    - Emotional indicators: ""rougher weeks,"" ""can't really explain why I feel like this,"" ""don't want to think like this anymore.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the author for themselves.
    - References to past actions: ""I've had some suicidal thoughts through my life,"" ""most of them are behind me."" Mentions a past *attempt by someone else* as a trigger.
    - Imminence: ""Since then I keep thinking about it."" This suggests current intrusive thoughts. The phrase ""it's now ok to try"" indicates a shift in perception where suicide is seen as a more attainable or acceptable option, but it doesn't state an immediate intention to act.
    - Writer's stated desire: The most crucial point is ""But I just don't want to think like this anymore."" This explicitly states that the suicidal thoughts are *unwanted*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The writer explicitly states, ""I just don't want to think like this anymore,"" indicating a desire *not* to have these thoughts or act on them.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""But I just don't want to think like this anymore."" This is a strong indicator for the 'Indicator' category.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act by the author? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation by the author? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past suicidal thoughts, a recent trigger (someone else's attempt), and current intrusive thoughts (""keep thinking about it"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The attempt mentioned was by ""someone who I know,"" not the author. The author's past experiences are limited to ""suicidal thoughts,"" not actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and a shift in perception (""it's now ok to try""). However, the defining characteristic is the explicit statement ""But I just don't want to think like this anymore.""
    - According to the definitions:
        - **Indicator:** ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" This perfectly matches the author's statement. There is distress and unwanted thoughts, but not a personal desire to die or act.
        - **Ideation:** Requires a ""clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" This is explicitly negated by ""I just don't want to think like this anymore.""
        - **Behavior:** Requires a plan, method, or intended action. Not present.
        - **Attempt:** Requires a past initiated action by the author. Not present.

    - Therefore, despite the presence of suicidal thoughts, their unwanted nature places this post in the 'Indicator' category.

377,"Stop please. I can't even do work, be productive, stay hydrated without having intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions, rage outbursts, followed by depressive episodes just want my life to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""just want my life to end"" is a clear expression of a desire for death or for life to cease.
    - Emotional indicators: ""intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions, rage outbursts, followed by depressive episodes"" indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None are mentioned.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The desire is stated as current (""just want my life to end""), but no specific timeframe for action is given.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear stated desire for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""just want my life to end"" is a strong equivalent expression of suicidal intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""just want my life to end.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as personal and current.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, does even a vague reference to action imply a method or plan? No, the post states a desire (""want my life to end"") but no action or plan, vague or otherwise.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention (""just want my life to end"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire for life to end (""just want my life to end""), which falls under the definition of Ideation. It is not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    - It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of a desire for life to end, not just abstract discussion or explicitly unwanted thoughts.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

378,"not sure what to call this-. i don't know how to describe it, but it feels like i disassociate sometimes. granted, it could just be adhd stuff along with a part of my extreme dysphoria and never feeling like i'm the person i appear as; but, it doesn't feel like i'm in my body. like i'm simply watching someone work and live while i only watch. when others call for me or start conversations, it's like i'm not a part of it. i can't fully think when i talk or write, like i act without my own permission. i feel so disconnected from life in itself already, to the point where my emotions never act how i want. even when it came to serious topics such as my dog's passing or nearly killing myself one night, i don't feel really anything for it. i just sit there and watch people express themselves, not knowing what to do. when i see others sad or stressed, i can't feel the same or help. everything seems so far out of my touch, like it's not even real at some times. i can write things down or do something earlier that day, only to feel as if it were fake or like i wasn't actually doing it/there. this doesn't held that i lucid dream so often that, when i wake back up, real life feels more as a dream than my actual dreams. i zone out fairly often to the point of not realizing where i am or what i was doing prior. i want to talk to a therapist about it, but i have no money nor insurance to talk to one. not like i'd even trust a therapist fully with how trashy past ones have treated me. and i've already caused enough trouble for my parents. all i can do is watch days pass by without me even realizing it. dealing with constant bad moods from my dad, to the point where he throws things at times, and barely seeing my mom as she works. it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states, ""nearly killing myself one night,"" which refers to a past suicidal action. It also mentions future potential actions: ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking."" These are specific methods/locations.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Disassociation, dysphoria, feeling disconnected from life, emotions not acting as wanted, inability to feel for serious topics, feeling like a spectator, feeling unreal, constant bad moods from dad, parental issues.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""step off a building"" and ""over a bridge"" are specific methods/locations for a future potential suicidal act.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""nearly killing myself one night"" is a clear reference to a past self-initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""it'll only take one day"" suggests a potential impulsive future action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer states, ""maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself,"" in reference to stepping off a building/bridge, indicating a desire to end their current state of distress and disassociation through a suicidal act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, ""nearly killing myself"" is a direct phrase.
    *   Yes, the phrase ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself"" clearly implies a desire for life to end as a means to achieve control, which is a form of suicidal intent.
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, ""step off a building"" and ""over a bridge"" are specific methods/locations mentioned for a future act.
    *   No explicit preparations (like notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both a past event (""nearly killing myself one night"") and a future intention (""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge"").
    *   The phrase ""nearly killing myself one night"" describes a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past. This fits the definition of an 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear expressions of suicidal ideation and future behavioral intent with specific methods (""step off a building or over a bridge""). This would normally lean towards 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the post also explicitly describes a *past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action*: ""nearly killing myself one night.""
    *   According to the rules, ""'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present."" Therefore, the presence of the past attempt overrides the current ideation/behavior for classification purposes.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""shits not worth it anymore. not for me."" (life not worth living), ""i need a way out."" (desire to escape/end life), ""i want to take myself out"" (direct suicidal intent), ""scared it'll be painful"" (consideration of the act and its potential pain). No specific method or means is mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i need help,"" ""don't want to deal with it,"" ""disappoint and burden other people,"" ""scared,"" ""can't go to anyone,"" ""just need it to stop."" (Hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, fear, distress).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is stated. ""scared it'll be painful"" implies thinking about *how* to ""take myself out"" but does not name a method or show preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""i want to take myself out"" is a current, active desire. The plea ""what do i do, please?"" suggests immediate distress and a desire for intervention related to this intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, genuine wish to end their life (""i want to take myself out,"" ""i need a way out,"" ""i just need it to stop"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""i want to take myself out,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/for life to end (""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""i need a way out,"" ""i just need it to stop"").
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them; rather, they are expressing a personal desire and seeking help for it.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied. The phrase ""scared it'll be painful"" indicates a consideration of the *consequences* of a method, not a description of a specific method itself.
    *   There are no signs of preparation.
    *   While there is high imminence and explicit desire, there is no ""vague reference to action"" that implies a *method* beyond the general intent to ""take myself out."" The fear of pain relates to the *outcome* of an unspecified action, not the action itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current/future intention (""i want to take myself out"").
    *   It does not describe any past, specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect, as there is clear, personal suicidal intent (""i want to take myself out"").
    *   **Ideation:** This fits. There are explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""i want to take myself out,"" ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""i need a way out,"" ""i just need it to stop""). Crucially, there is no specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned. The fear of pain is a contemplation related to the act, not a description of *how* the act will be carried out.
    *   **Behavior:** Incorrect. While there is strong intent and implied imminence, there is no mention of a specific plan, method (even vague), or preparation. The ""scared it'll be painful"" does not constitute a method or plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Incorrect, as no past self-initiated suicidal action is described.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal ideation without detailing a specific plan or method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of a desire for death.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Screw this,"" ""Can't be fucked with anything anymore"" indicate extreme frustration, despair, and anhedonia/helplessness.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.

    - Imminence: ""The more I live the more I want to die"" indicates a growing, ongoing desire, but no specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""soon.""
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I want to die"" is a clear expression of death intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to die"" is a direct and unambiguous statement of this desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a personal wish, not an unwanted thought.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Is there even a vague reference to action implying a method or plan due to high imminence? No, imminence is not high, and no action is implied beyond the desire.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current and ongoing desire/intention (""The more I live the more I want to die"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""I want to die""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator', as 'Indicator' is for general distress or *unwanted* suicidal thoughts without a clear personal desire to die.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation', which includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive any longer, without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**

    *   The post explicitly states the *absence* of a specific plan, method, or preparation (""but I have yet to find a way""). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does not describe any past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions. It describes thoughts and contemplation, not attempts. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out.

I hate how I took the meds and just complied for months and months. I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it. I don't want to wuss out and then regret sending them.

It's a centimeter better than being alone, but it's awful. The person I live with won't stop talking, tv is always on. Both of us have no jobs.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Must end this shit show,"" ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it,"" ""I don't want to wuss out and then regret sending them,"" ""So many people commit suicide,"" ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming negativity, hate, despair, anxiety about the future, feeling ruined, being ""OVER this shit.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This is a clear preparatory step linked to a suicidal act.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop"" describes past *ideation*, not an initiated action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""Must end this shit show,"" ""before I do it,"" ""I don't want to wuss out."" Suggests a current and potentially imminent intent to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to end their life (""Must end this shit show,"" ""killing myself""). Not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; rather, expressing a desire to act on them.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and ""commit suicide.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire to die/for life to end (""Must end this shit show,"" ""I'm very OVER this shit"").
    *   The writer does *not* state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they express a desire to follow through (""don't want to wuss out"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is not mentioned.
    *   However, there are clear signs of preparation: ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This indicates a concrete step being taken in preparation for a suicidal act. The phrase ""before I do it"" directly links the emails to an intended action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current/future intentions (""Must end this shit show,"" ""before I do it""). It also mentions past ideation (""thought about killing myself for 5 years"").
    *   It does *not* describe a past, specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author. The ""5 years of thinking"" is ideation, not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and desire to die (""killing myself,"" ""must end this shit show"").
    *   It's not purely 'Ideation' because it goes beyond just thoughts and desires. The mention of ""emails to send to my parents before I do it"" constitutes a preparatory step for a suicidal act. This moves it into the 'Behavior' category.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past *initiated action* that was potentially lethal. The mention of ""thinking about killing myself for 5 years"" refers to ideation, not an attempt. The current intent and preparation point to 'Behavior'.

Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a concrete preparatory step (sending emails before the act) classifies this as Behavior.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""Ending it soon"" is a direct statement of suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""so fucking depressed,"" ""scared,"" ""fucked me up for good.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here."" This clearly states a specific substance (method), a quantity, and a plan to ingest it upon arrival (intended action). Ordering it is a preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions losing a job and a ""bad trip"" as contributing factors, but no past *suicidal* actions.
    *   **Imminence:** ""Ending it soon,"" ""as soon as it gets here"" indicates high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A clear desire to die is expressed (""Ending it soon"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   ""Ending it soon"" explicitly mentions a direct intent to end their life. (Yes)
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die. (Yes)
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method (""14 grams of dextromethorphan"") and an intended action (""taking it all"") are mentioned.
    *   Preparation is clearly stated: ""ordered... in the mail.""
    *   This is not vague; it's a concrete plan with an acquired means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current preparation (""ordered... in the mail"") and a future intention (""Ending it soon,"" ""taking it all as soon as it gets here"").
    *   It does *not* describe a past, initiated, potentially lethal action by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, personal expressions of suicidal intent (""Ending it soon""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It includes a specific method (""14 grams of dextromethorphan,"" ""taking it all"") and a preparatory step (""ordered... in the mail""). This goes beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    *   It describes a *future* intended action and *current* preparation for that action, not a *past completed or initiated* action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal intent, a specific method, and active preparation for a future act aligns directly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

When did Human thought it would be cool living so much?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post discusses ""tend to die around 80,"" and repeatedly questions ""how people can want to live?"" and ""how they actually find important to stay alive?"". It expresses dread at the prospect of living ""60 fucking years left.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, anhedonia regarding life itself, questioning the value of existence. The past 15 years ""wasn't really good.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions ""I 'really lived' 15 years, and it wasn't really good,"" but this refers to general life experience, not a past suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No imminence mentioned.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a profound lack of desire to live by questioning why anyone would want to live and finding the prospect of a long life daunting and undesirable. This implies a desire for life to end or a strong lack of desire to continue living.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, strongly implied. The rhetorical questions ""how people can want to live?"" and ""how they actually find important to stay alive?"" clearly convey the author's personal inability to find value in life and an implied desire for it to end, or at least a profound lack of desire to continue. The dread of ""60 fucking years left"" reinforces this.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the post expresses a personal sentiment about the futility of life, not unwanted thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current reflection on the future prospect of living.
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') because it directly questions the value of living and expresses a profound lack of desire to continue living (""how people can want to live?"", dread of ""60 fucking years left""). This constitutes a personal expression of a desire for life to end or not to continue, aligning with 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' due to the strong implied desire for life to end or not to continue, without any plan or action.

Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Key elements: Mentions ""suicidal,"" ""suicide by cop,"" ""suicide.""
    - Emotional indicators: Expresses concern about how to handle suicidal individuals and frustration with counterproductive actions. No personal despair or hopelessness is expressed by the author.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""Suicide by cop"" is mentioned, but it's in the context of a hypothetical ""someone"" else, not a personal plan or method of the author.
    - References to past actions: None by the author.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: No personal intentions are stated. The discussion is a general warning.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer is discussing a scenario involving other people and offering an opinion/warning, not expressing a personal desire to die or for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal,"" ""suicide by cop,"" ""suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No, not from the author themselves. The desire/state is attributed to a hypothetical ""someone.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? N/A, the author is not expressing personal suicidal thoughts.
    - Based on the above, the post discusses suicide abstractly, not as a personal intent of the author.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? ""Suicide by cop"" is a method, but it is attributed to a hypothetical ""someone,"" not the author. There are no signs of preparation by the author.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a general warning about a potential future scenario involving ""someone"" else.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post discusses the topic of suicide and suicidal behavior (""suicide by cop"") in an abstract, cautionary, or advisory manner.
    - There is no clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author of the post. The author is discussing how others might react to suicidal individuals, not expressing their own suicidal thoughts or plans.
    - This fits the definition of 'Indicator' because it discusses suicide abstractly and lacks personal suicidal intent from the author.

Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states ""had a plan in mind ever since,"" ""might be the way I choose to go,"" and mentions ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" as a specific method. It also says ""Had a couple ideas for how to do it"" and ""Thought about doing it a couple times."" The ""it"" clearly refers to suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life,"" ""hate being a burden.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** A clear method is identified: using ""100s of units of insulin"" via a ""pump."" The phrase ""might be the way I choose to go"" indicates an intended action, contingent on a diagnosis. ""Had a couple ideas for how to do it"" confirms planning.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up."" This explicitly states that past thoughts/plans were *not acted upon*. ""I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens"" describes a past medical incident, not a self-initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The intention is contingent on receiving a Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis and the condition worsening (""if it turns out I do,"" ""if my condition goes south quick""). While conditional, the plan is already formed and detailed.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to end life using the described method if the condition worsens.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not with those exact words, but the context of ""plan,"" ""way I choose to go,"" ""how to do it,"" and the specific method of insulin overdose leaves no doubt about suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""might be the way I choose to go"" with insulin implies a desire to end life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer is actively considering and detailing a method they *would* choose.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" using a ""pump"" is a specific method and tool.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The focus on acquiring the pump as a means (""Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump"") and having ""ideas for how to do it"" points towards planning and potential future preparation.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The method here is quite specific.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *future contingent intention* (""if it turns out I do,"" ""if my condition goes south quick"") and past *considerations/thoughts* of action that were *not initiated* (""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The post explicitly states ""didn't"" act on past thoughts. The ""almost went into shock"" event was a medical incident, not a self-initiated suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""might be the way I choose to go""), not just general distress or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, it's not Indicator.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post goes beyond mere ideation by identifying a specific method (""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" with a ""pump"") and discussing it as a chosen ""way to go,"" indicating a concrete plan or intended action (even if contingent). This fits the definition of Behavior.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** The post describes a future contingent plan and past thoughts/plans that were *not acted upon*. It does *not* describe any past or very recent *initiated* potentially lethal action. Therefore, it is not an Attempt.

The presence of a clear desire to die, combined with a specific method (insulin pump) and a stated intention to use it under certain conditions, classifies this as Behavior.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Birthday ☹️"", ""nobody told me happy birthday or anything . they just walked past me like I was nothing"", ""tired of everything !"", ""Worst birthday ever !"". These indicate deep despair, feelings of worthlessness, and hopelessness.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""have a chance right now"". This is not a specific method (like ""pills"" or ""gun""), but it strongly implies that the means or opportunity to act is present and immediately available.
    - References to past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""right now"" indicates very high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday? well I do"" - clearly expresses a personal desire to die by suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill yourself"" and ""well I do"" in response to that.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""well I do"" (want to kill myself) and ""im just tired of everything !"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states they *do* want to act on them (""well I do"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method is named (e.g., pills, gun).
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations (e.g., ""wrote a note"").
    - ""Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context."" The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" in the context of wanting to ""kill yourself"" and the high imminence (""right now"") implies that the means or opportunity to act is available. While not a specific method, it suggests an actionable element beyond mere ideation, leaning towards 'Behavior' as it implies a perceived opportunity to execute an action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""I do and I have a chance right now"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is incorrect because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and desire to die.
    - 'Ideation' is a possibility, as no *specific* method is named. However, the phrase ""I have a chance right now,"" combined with explicit suicidal intent and high imminence (""right now""), suggests more than just thoughts. It implies the availability of means or opportunity to act, which pushes it beyond pure ideation. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""an intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence)"". ""Have a chance right now"" fits this description.
    - 'Behavior' aligns well. There's explicit suicidal intent (""I do"" want to ""kill myself""), high imminence (""right now""), and the phrase ""I have a chance right now"" implies the presence of an opportunity or means to carry out the act, even if the specific method isn't detailed. This indicates an intended action or a perceived immediate opportunity to act.
    - 'Attempt' is incorrect as no past initiated action is described.

Conclusion: The explicit desire to kill oneself, combined with the high imminence and the statement ""I have a chance right now"" (implying an available means or opportunity to act), moves this beyond just ideation into the realm of behavior.

I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""I'm finally considering suicide."" It also includes rhetorical questions about death: ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""stressed,"" ""bawling,"" ""mental health over this school year has been bad,"" ""fucked up my head,"" ""confused,"" ""desolate,"" ""pathetic,"" ""feels like this all means nothing.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. There is no indication of a specific method, tool, location, or preparatory act.
    *   **References to past actions:** The post details past academic struggles (""myriad of missing assignments,"" ""C- in my worst classes,"" ""AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep""). There are no references to past *suicidal* actions or attempts.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""finally considering suicide"" indicates a current state of consideration, not an immediate or imminent plan. The phrase ""I don't want to do this anymore"" relates to the overwhelming school situation, not explicitly an imminent suicidal act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a personal desire for life to end or to not continue in their current state (""I don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents,"" ""Why should I give a shit""). While there's distress about *having* these thoughts (""It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide""), the subsequent text confirms a genuine personal desire for life to end or a strong consideration of suicide, not merely unwanted intrusive thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""considering suicide.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end or not to be alive, particularly through phrases like ""I don't want to do this anymore"" in the context of overwhelming despair, and ""I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents"" which implies a personal desire to die if not for external factors. The nihilistic ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit"" further supports a desire for life to end or a questioning of its value.
    *   The writer notes it's ""terrible"" they are considering suicide, indicating distress about the thoughts, but the overall context and subsequent statements show a genuine personal consideration and desire, not just unwanted thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no high imminence coupled with a vague reference to action that would imply a method or plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings of overwhelm, despair, and a current consideration of suicide.
    *   It does not describe any past or very recent specific, potentially lethal *suicidal* actions initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""considering suicide"") and a clear desire for life to end or not to be alive (""I don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents,"" ""Why should I give a shit""). This rules out 'Indicator', as there is clear personal suicidal intent, not just general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations being taken. This rules out 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""attempted to end my life,"" ""kill myself,"" ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding,"" ""knife,"" ""almost committed.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""shaking and bawling,"" ""worst feeling,"" ""worst suspense,"" ""too much of a pussy,"" ""Living life as a shell is bullshit."" High distress, self-criticism, despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method (""knife"") and outcome (""wrists and thighs are bleeding"") are mentioned in the context of an initiated action.
    *   **References to past actions, including those initiated but not completed:** ""I just attempted to end my life,"" ""I was right there. Right there about to do,"" ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already,"" ""I put down my knife,"" ""I almost committed."" This clearly describes an initiated, but not completed, suicidal act.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I just attempted"" indicates a very recent past action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I was ready leave everything,"" ""Living life as a shell is bullshit but I cant even kill myself."" There is a clear desire to die, despite the failure of the attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""attempted to end my life"" and ""kill myself,"" and expresses a desire to ""leave everything"" and that ""Living life as a shell is bullshit.""
    *   The writer is expressing frustration at the *failure* of the attempt, not that they didn't want to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""knife"") and the result of its use (""wrists and thighs are bleeding"") are mentioned in the context of the initiated action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a very recent past event: ""I just attempted to end my life.""
    *   It describes a specific, potentially lethal action (""I just attempted to end my life,"" ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already,"" ""I put down my knife"") that was initiated by the author. The action was initiated and caused self-harm, even if it wasn't completed.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes a ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated action by the author that was potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death."" The phrases ""I just attempted to end my life,"" ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already,"" and ""I put down my knife"" directly indicate an initiated suicidal act.
    *   According to the definitions, 'Attempt' takes precedence when a past initiated action is clearly described.
    *   This fits the definition of 'Attempt' perfectly.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to"" - Direct mention of suicide and a personal desire.
        *   ""I feel like killing myself"" - Direct personal expression of suicidal ideation.
        *   ""I know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't."" - Direct personal expression of suicidal ideation, coupled with a stated lack of courage/means to act.
        *   ""once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live"" - Conditional desire for life to end.
        *   ""I guess I'm dying alone too"" - General feeling.
        *   ""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it"" - Expression of meaninglessness.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, isolation, feeling unappreciated, feeling like a burden, profound sadness due to family issues.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The post explicitly states a *lack* of guts/ability to act, which implies no plan or preparation is being made.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've never actually attempted suicide"" - explicitly states *no* past attempt. The mention of calling hotlines is seeking help, not an attempt.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The desire to die is present, but immediately qualified by ""but I don't"" (have the guts), indicating low imminence of action. The conditional desire (""once everyone I care about dies"") is also not imminent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to die (""wanting to,"" ""I would"" if able, ""feel like killing myself""). This is not distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a genuine, albeit constrained, wish.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself"" multiple times.
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""despite wanting to,"" ""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would,"" ""no other reason to live"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. The ""but I don't"" refers to the *ability* to act, not a lack of desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   Given the explicit statement ""I know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't,"" there is no indication of a plan, method, or intended action, even vague, coupled with high imminence. Imminence is low due to the stated lack of courage.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and intentions (""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts... I would"").
    *   It explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide,"" thus negating any past initiated suicidal action by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, explicit, personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is personal and not stated as unwanted.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide"" and ""I know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't."" This negates any past initiated action ('Attempt') and clearly indicates a *lack* of a specific plan, method, or preparation for current or future action ('Behavior'). The desire is present, but the means/courage/plan is explicitly stated as absent.
    *   Therefore, the presence of clear ideation without any plan, method, or initiated action places this post firmly in the 'Ideation' category.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape,"" ""written my suicide note,"" ""slit my wrists with some scissors.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail?,"" ""That's impossible""), despair, feeling trapped (""only escape""), sadness (""Kinda sad I never got to do anything"").

    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""tonight,"" ""when everyone is going to bed"" - very high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die and end life. No indication of unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""ending my life,"" ""Killing myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    *   The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; rather, they affirm them as their only escape.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""slit my wrists""), tool (""scissors""), and preparations (""written my suicide note,"" ""delete everything"") are mentioned.
    *   Yes, the intent and imminence are very high, and specific actions are detailed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current/future intention (""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""I'm gonna just delete everything and just slit my wrists"").
    *   It does not describe a past specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire because it includes a specific method (""slit my wrists""), a specific means (""scissors""), a specific timeframe (""tonight,"" ""when everyone is going to bed""), and clear preparations (""written my suicide note,"" ""delete everything""). This combination of explicit intent, specific plan/method/means, and preparations fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a *past initiated* suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""what the fuck"" indicates strong frustration, anger, and possibly feeling trapped or violated. ""like preventing someone to get euthanized"" strongly conveys a desire for death and autonomy over ending their life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states ""my plan to kill myself."" While the *details* of the plan are not provided, the *existence* of a plan is explicitly stated by the author.
    *   **References to past actions:** No mention of past actions or attempts.
    *   **Imminence:** The phrase ""now they're keeping their heads up and watching me"" implies the plan was recent or current enough to trigger intervention, suggesting a current desire to act. The frustration indicates the desire is still present.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A clear, strong desire to die and act on it is expressed through ""my plan to kill myself"" and the euthanasia analogy.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/for life to end, reinforced by the euthanasia analogy.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them. In fact, they express frustration that their plan was revealed, indicating a desire to proceed.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" This directly matches. While no specific method is detailed, the explicit mention of a ""plan"" is sufficient for 'Behavior' when coupled with clear intent and implied imminence.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current situation (being watched) due to a revealed ""plan."" It implies a current or very recent intention.
    *   It does not describe a past, initiated, potentially lethal action. It describes a *plan* that was revealed, not an *attempt* that occurred.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is clear ideation (""kill myself""), the post goes beyond mere thoughts by explicitly stating the existence of a ""plan.""
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. There is explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""euthanized"") AND the mention of a ""plan to kill myself."" This meets the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The post describes a ""plan"" that was revealed, not a past initiated action or attempt.

The presence of a clear desire to die and the explicit mention of a ""plan"" (even without specific details of the method) places this post firmly in the 'Behavior' category.

393,Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children and then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now. I hope my baby ends up safe,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly states ""im gonna kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: Implied despair and hopelessness given the stated intent and concern for the baby's safety.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        - Plan: ""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children and then im gonna kill myself."" This describes a clear sequence of preparatory actions leading to suicide.
        - Method: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned.
        - Preparations: ""minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children"" is a clear preparatory step involving social withdrawal. ""I hope my baby ends up safe"" implies making arrangements or expressing concern for dependents, which can be a form of preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""3 weeks from now."" This is a specific, near-future timeline.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear and explicit desire to die (""im gonna kill myself"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""im gonna kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer clearly states an intention to act.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No specific *method* is named.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the planned social withdrawal for 3 weeks (""minimally interact...won't reach out"") is a clear preparatory action. The concern for the baby's safety also suggests preparation for their absence.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While no *method* is named, the explicit intent, the specific timeframe (""3 weeks from now""), and the described preparatory actions (social withdrawal) are strong indicators of a plan and intended action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A future intention (""3 weeks from now"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator:** No, because there is clear, explicit, personal suicidal intent and a plan/preparations.
    - **Ideation:** No, because the post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire to die. It includes specific preparatory actions (social withdrawal) and a timeline (""3 weeks from now"") leading up to the stated act. This constitutes a plan.
    - **Behavior:** Yes. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""im gonna kill myself"") AND clearly mentions preparations (""minimally interact with everyone...for 3 weeks,"" ""won't reach out"") and a specific timeframe for the intended action (""3 weeks from now""). Even without a specific *method*, the detailed preparations and timeline qualify it as 'Behavior'.
    - **Attempt:** No, as it describes a future intention, not a past initiated action.

Based on the analysis, the presence of explicit suicidal intent, clear preparatory actions (social withdrawal), and a defined timeline for the act strongly categorize this as 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The phrase ""Would this kill me"" directly references death and implies a suicidal intent given the context of substances.
    - Emotional indicators: The question implies despair and a desire to end life.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, very specific.
        - Method: Ingestion/overdose.
        - Substances: Midol (3 bottles), Prozac (30 20mg pills), Tylenol (1 bottle), Alcohol (water bottle full).
        - Preparations: The listing of specific quantities and types of substances implies they are gathered or readily available, which constitutes preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The question is posed in the present tense, implying current consideration and potential imminent action.
    - Writer's stated desire: The question ""Would this kill me"" in the context of listing specific, large quantities of potentially lethal substances strongly indicates a desire to die by ingesting them. It's an inquiry into the lethality of a specific, prepared method.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"": No, but ""Would this kill me"" in this context is a very strong implicit expression of suicidal intent.
    - Clear desire to die: Yes, the inquiry about the lethality of a specific combination of substances indicates a clear desire to die.
    - Unwanted thoughts: No, the post does not state that these thoughts are unwanted. It's a direct inquiry about a specific plan.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Specific method/tool/substance/location: Yes, specific substances (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, alcohol) and quantities are listed, clearly indicating a method (overdose/ingestion).
    - Signs of preparation: Yes, the detailed list of multiple bottles/pills implies these items have been gathered or are at hand, which is a clear sign of preparation.
    - Imminence and vague action: The imminence is high (current inquiry), and the method is not vague; it's very specific.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Current/future intention: The post describes a current consideration (""Would this kill me"") regarding a potential future action using specific, prepared means.
    - Past initiated action: No, this is not a description of a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator': There is a clear, implicit personal expression of suicidal desire and specific methods/preparations are mentioned. It's not general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - Not 'Ideation': This goes beyond mere thoughts or desire to die because specific substances, quantities, and an implied plan/preparation are present.
    - 'Behavior': This fits perfectly. There is an implicit expression of suicidal desire (""Would this kill me"") coupled with a very specific plan (ingesting multiple medications and alcohol), specific methods (the listed substances), and clear signs of preparation (the quantities of bottles/pills imply they are gathered or available). The question is an inquiry about the lethality of this specific, prepared plan.
    - Not 'Attempt': This is not a description of a past initiated action.

    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings by mentioning a specific method (""Like a car accident or something"") and the phrase ""How I'm planning to end it"" indicates a plan. This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific, albeit deceptive, method and planning indicates 'Behavior'.

396,I'm a complete lost cause and nothing I do can change it. All I have ever done since I got back from uni was become constantly stuck. I've never had any skills that are useful to anyone. My family are giving up on me my dad hardly talks to me and I'm a constant burden on my sister and I'll never be able to help my mum in anyway. Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in. What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family. Hell I booked driving lesson but me being mentally dumb picked an expensive instructor and all it did was make my sister more stressed than she already was. She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""complete lost cause,"" ""constantly stuck,"" ""never had any skills that are useful,"" ""family are giving up on me,"" ""constant burden,"" ""never be able to help,"" ""failed miserably,"" ""big fuck up of the family,"" ""mentally dumb,"" ""always going to fail everything."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and feeling like a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** The phrase ""Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably"" refers to attempts to improve their life situation (jobs, driving lessons), not suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No suicidal intentions are stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses deep distress about their perceived failures and their impact on their family. There is *no* explicit or implied desire to die or for life to end. The focus is on their inability to succeed or be useful.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. There are no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't here,"" ""I hate living,"" or ""life isn't worth it.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a desire to die with high imminence implying a vague action? No, there is no desire to die expressed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings of being a ""lost cause"" and past failures in life (jobs, driving lessons).
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The ""attempts"" mentioned are clearly related to trying to fix life problems, not suicidal actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness and being a burden. These are important risk factors for suicide.
    *   However, the post *does not* contain any explicit or implicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. It focuses entirely on the author's perceived failures in life and their impact on family.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no stated desire to die or suicidal thoughts.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no plan, method, or intended action.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as no past self-initiated potentially lethal action is described. The word ""attempts"" is used in a different context.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'Indicator' category, as it expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I feel like shit,"" ""alone and depressed,"" ""fucking sad."" These indicate significant emotional distress.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""right now"" suggests immediate need for support due to current distress.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer wants to ""vent about it or just talk to someone about random basic things to feel a little less alone and depressed."" The desire is for connection and relief from emotional pain, not a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The post expresses a desire to feel ""less alone and depressed,"" which is the opposite of wanting to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.
    - If suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned OR the desire is clearly negated/unwanted, lean towards 'Indicator'. This post does not mention suicide or death, and the desire is for relief from distress, not death.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. No explicit desire to die is present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current distress and a request for immediate support.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress (""feel like shit,"" ""alone and depressed,"" ""fucking sad"") and a strong need for social connection to cope with this distress.
    - There is no mention of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, or past attempts.
    - The language used clearly indicates a cry for help and connection due to profound sadness and loneliness, which aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.""

398,"I wrote a note today. I've been struggling with this my whole life. But always I felt that there was some light at the end of the tunnel if only i could just get to it. Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more."" (Implies consideration of death as an option, and reduced fear of it). ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""I just can't continue,"" ""I can't keep going like this."" (Strong expressions of wanting life to end or being unable to continue living).
    - Emotional indicators: ""struggling,"" ""light has disappeared,"" ""severe anxiety,"" ""worthless person,"" ""at the end of my rope,"" ""at my wits end,"" ""more harm than good,"" ""no results."" (Profound hopelessness, despair, exhaustion).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I wrote a note today."" (This is a clear preparation for suicide).
    - References to past actions: ""end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital."" (Describes a past crisis requiring hospitalization, but does not explicitly state it was a self-initiated suicidal action/attempt). ""in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results"" (Past treatment experiences).
    - Imminence: ""today"" (for the note), ""lately,"" ""anymore,"" ""this is my last chance."" (Suggests current, ongoing, and escalating crisis).
    - Writer's stated desire: ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""I just can't continue,"" ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more."" (Clear desire for life to end or inability to continue living).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, through phrases like ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""I just can't continue,"" and the diminished fear of ""non existence after death."" This indicates strong suicidal ideation.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post implies a desire to act by mentioning the note and the feeling of being at the end of their rope.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I wrote a note today."" This is a direct mention of a preparation for suicide.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: While no method is explicitly stated, the *preparation* (writing a note) is a concrete step towards a suicidal act, coupled with the strong desire to end life and high imminence.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Both. Past struggles and a recent ER visit are mentioned, but the core of the current risk is the current state of despair and the *current* action of writing a note (""today"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The ER visit is mentioned, but the post does not state that the author initiated a suicidal action that led to the ER visit. It's described as ""end up in the ER,"" not ""I tried to kill myself and ended up in the ER."" Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire for life to end and an inability to continue (""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""I just can't continue,"" ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - The presence of this strong ideation, combined with the explicit mention of a preparation (""I wrote a note today""), fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The definition of Behavior includes ""preparations being taken.""
    - It does not describe a past *initiated lethal action* by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The writing of the note is a concrete step towards a suicidal act, distinguishing it from 'Ideation' which lacks a plan, method, or preparation.

399,Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end my life"" is a direct reference to suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: The phrase ""Didn't work"" implies frustration or despair regarding the failure of the attempt.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned for the action described.
    - References to past actions: ""Tried to end my life again"" clearly indicates a past, self-initiated action. The word ""tried"" signifies an initiated action, and ""again"" implies multiple such past actions. ""Didn't work"" confirms the action was an attempt that failed.
    - Imminence: The actions described are in the past tense.
    - Writer's stated desire: The desire to ""end my life"" was present during the past actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - The post explicitly mentions a past attempt to ""end my life,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent at the time of the action.
    - The post describes a clear desire to die that led to an action in the past.
    - There is no negation of the desire; rather, the ""didn't work"" implies a desire for the attempt to have succeeded.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for the *past* action. However, the core of the post is about an *initiated action*, not a plan or method for a future action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a past event: ""Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.""
    - It describes a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* by the author in the past (""Tried to end my life""). The word ""tried"" is crucial here, as it signifies an action was undertaken.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly describes a past, self-initiated action that was intended to be lethal (""Tried to end my life""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.
    - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death... A concrete, potentially life-threatening action by the author must have been *initiated*.""
    - The phrases ""Tried didn't work"" and ""Tried to end my life again"" perfectly fit this description.
    - Even though no method is specified, the crucial element is the *initiation of a potentially lethal action*.
    - 'Attempt' takes precedence when a past initiated action is clearly described.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None. The post details a chronic medical condition stemming from an injury, and the subsequent diagnostic and treatment journey.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much."" This indicates profound frustration, despair, and hopelessness, but specifically in the context of his persistent physical symptoms and the failure of various medical interventions. It does not express a desire to die.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None related to suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** The entire post describes a past injury (7 months ago) and the ongoing symptoms and medical consultations since then. No past *suicidal* actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No intentions related to suicide are stated. The ""don't know what to do anymore"" refers to finding a solution for his medical condition.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer's desire is for relief from his physical symptoms and for his condition to improve. There is no stated desire to die or for life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The hopelessness is tied to his medical condition, not a desire to end his life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No suicidal thoughts are mentioned at all.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past injury and ongoing current symptoms and frustration.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes significant distress, sadness, and hopelessness (""I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore"").
    *   However, this hopelessness is clearly and explicitly linked to the ongoing, unresolved physical symptoms and the failure of various medical treatments.
    *   There is no mention of suicide, self-harm, a desire to die, or any suicidal ideation. The distress is about his physical suffering and lack of a cure, not about wanting to end his life.
    *   Therefore, it expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator'.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme self-loathing (""self-absorbed whiny piece of shit,"" ""flaming turd,"" ""fucking monster,"" ""I know I suck""), hopelessness (""no plans and I don't think I'd succeed anyway,"" ""there is no better, this is it""), feeling like a burden, despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states, ""I have no plans."" While specific methods of death are mentioned (""bullet in my head,"" ""stomp me out,"" ""slit my fucking throat""), these are expressed as desired *outcomes* or desires for *others* to inflict harm, not as *self-initiated plans, methods, or preparations* by the author.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""), but the intensity of the desire to die is very high. However, the ""no plans"" statement suggests a lack of immediate *self-initiated* action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A very clear, strong, and personal desire to die and for life to end. This is not about unwanted thoughts; it's a deep-seated belief that they deserve death.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not directly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, unequivocally. ""I deserve to die,"" ""I just deserve to be dead,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire for death is presented as deserved and desired.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Methods of death are mentioned (""bullet,"" ""stomp,"" ""slit throat""), but they are framed as desires for *how* death might occur or be inflicted by others, not as *self-initiated plans or preparations*. The post explicitly states, ""I have no plans.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die... implies a method or plan: The desire to die is extremely high and graphic. However, the explicit negation ""I have no plans"" is a strong counter-indicator for 'Behavior'. The methods described are desires for a violent end, not the author's own intended actions to achieve it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current feelings and desires.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** This is clearly not 'Indicator'. The post expresses a very strong, explicit, and personal desire for death, not general distress or unwanted thoughts. Phrases like ""I deserve to die"" and ""I wish someone would... slit my fucking throat"" are direct expressions of a desire for life to end.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** This is the key distinction. While the post contains very graphic and intense expressions of a desire to die, including specific methods of death, it *explicitly states, ""I have no plans.""* The methods mentioned are desires for a specific *type* of death or for death to be inflicted by others, not a self-initiated plan or preparation to carry out the act. For 'Behavior', there must be some indication of the author's *own intended action, plan, or preparation*. Since this is explicitly negated (""I have no plans"") and the methods are framed as external desires (""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""I wish someone would... slit my fucking throat""), it falls into 'Ideation'. The intensity and specificity of the *desired outcome* are high, but the *action component* (self-initiated plan/method/preparation) is absent and explicitly denied.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No past initiated action is described.

Therefore, despite the graphic nature of the desired death, the explicit statement ""I have no plans"" and the framing of methods as external desires (or desires for a specific *type* of death rather than a *self-initiated plan*) means it fits 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""I will die alone."" ""the second they're gone, so am I."" (This strongly implies self-inflicted death). No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""obligation,"" ""hideous fucking mutant,"" ""fat retard,"" ""sad man,"" ""sick of this emptiness,"" ""longing,"" ""despair,"" ""hopelessness."" These are very strong indicators of profound distress, self-loathing, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The condition ""the second they're gone"" is a trigger, not a method.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The intention is conditional on a future event (""the second they're gone""), so it's not immediate (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). However, the resolve is clearly stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire for life to end, explicitly stated as ""the second they're gone, so am I"" in the context of ending their suffering. The phrase ""sick of this emptiness"" further supports a desire for their current state of being to cease. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they are presented as a firm intention.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""the second they're gone, so am I"" clearly expresses a desire for life to end by their own hand, conditional on a future event. This is a profound expression of wanting life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly stated as a future intention.

    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. While the desire to die is strong, the imminence is tied to an external, undefined future event. There is no vague reference to *how* they would act, only *when* (conditionally).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""the second they're gone, so am I"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress (""Indicator"") because it contains a clear, personal expression of a desire for life to end and a future intention to die by suicide (""the second they're gone, so am I"").
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action (""Attempt"").
    *   It expresses a clear desire to die and a future intention, but crucially, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. The statement ""so am I"" expresses the *outcome* of their intention, not the *means* or *process*. Without any indication of *how* they intend to act, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive any longer, without a specific plan, method, or intended action.

403,"don't know what to do but I'm here for now. got bad urges tonight. not even just suicidal ones, self destructive ones in general as well. they've been happening again for a while now, since I dropped out of college. I'm talking to some friends now. not about them or anything, just random stuff. it's helping, but I'm just lying here wondering if I should tell them. every conversation I have with them these days, I'm just thinking ""this might be our last conversation"". during our dnd sessions, I'm thinking it could be my last. then I read this post on tumblr about the aftermath of suicide on people left behind and I started crying. and there's four friends in particular I'd be worried about and I can't help but think about them and hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them and my sibling. and now it's just a guilty downward spiral but I can't do much about it right now, and I don't want to worry any of my friends by telling them how bad it is, like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad. I don't know what I want anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ones"" (urges), ""thinking of killing myself,"" and ""the aftermath of suicide."" It also contains phrases like ""this might be our last conversation"" and ""it could be my last [dnd session],"" which imply a personal death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""don't know what to do,"" ""bad urges,"" ""guilty downward spiral,"" ""hate myself,"" ""started crying,"" ""don't know what I want anymore."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and guilt.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states: ""like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" This is a direct admission of having a plan. No specific method or preparation details are provided, but the existence of a plan is confirmed.
    *   **References to past actions:** The ""urges... have been happening again for a while now."" This refers to ongoing thoughts/urges, not a past initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""tonight,"" ""for now,"" ""every conversation I have with them these days, I'm just thinking 'this might be our last conversation'."" This indicates current, ongoing, and potentially imminent thoughts, despite ""no date set"" for the plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states ""thinking of killing myself"" and admits to having ""a plan."" While they express guilt (""hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them""), this guilt is about the *impact* on others, not a negation of the personal desire or thoughts themselves. The thoughts are clearly personal and present.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ones"" and ""thinking of killing myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end or not be alive (""this might be our last conversation,"" ""it could be my last [dnd session],"" ""thinking of killing myself"").
    *   No, the writer does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them. The guilt expressed is about the *consequences* for others, not a rejection of the personal desire to die or the thoughts themselves. The presence of ""a plan"" further confirms personal intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" This is a direct admission of having a plan. While no specific method, tool, or location is detailed, the mere mention of ""a plan"" is sufficient to meet the criteria for 'Behavior' when coupled with explicit suicidal intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current urges (""tonight""), ongoing thoughts (""been happening again for a while now""), and a current/future intention (""I have a plan"").
    *   There is no description of a past, specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""thinking of killing myself,"" ""this might be our last conversation""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the intent is personal and present, not merely abstract or explicitly unwanted.
    *   The crucial element is the explicit statement: ""like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" This direct admission of having ""a plan"" moves the classification beyond 'Ideation' and into 'Behavior'. 'Behavior' is defined as including explicit suicidal thoughts/desire *and* mentioning a plan, method, intended action, or preparations. The mention of ""a plan"" fits this criterion.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

Based on the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts/desire and the direct statement of having ""a plan,"" the most appropriate classification is 'Behavior'.

404,"The questionnaires that include a question asking if I've had suicidal thoughts actually make me less likely to talk about. Because I know it'll cause a massive issue and result in a lot of stress. There going to ask me too many details, and be too insistent with their questioning. I find therapy tough enough as it is, and if lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff, then that's great. Well it's great till it starts to happen more and more frequently. I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""grave I dug myself"" (metaphorical, implying profound despair or a life-threatening situation).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""less likely to talk about,"" ""massive issue,"" ""lot of stress,"" ""tough enough,"" ""lying,"" ""starts to happen more and more frequently,"" ""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave."" These indicate distress, avoidance, increasing severity of thoughts, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past *initiated* suicidal actions are mentioned. The post refers to the *frequency* of past and current suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Imminence:** ""starts to happen more and more frequently"" suggests an increasing trend, but no immediate ""tonight"" or ""now.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer is expressing distress about *having* suicidal thoughts and the difficulty of discussing them. The phrase ""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" strongly implies a feeling of being trapped in a deeply despairing or life-threatening state, suggesting a desire for this suffering to end, or a fear of succumbing to suicidal urges. This leans towards a personal desire for the current state to end, which is characteristic of ideation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the increasing frequency of ""suicidal thoughts"" and the metaphor ""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" convey a profound sense of hopelessness and being trapped in a suicidal state. This implies a personal struggle with the desire for the suffering to end, or a fear of succumbing to the thoughts, which aligns with ideation.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The post expresses distress about the *consequences* of discussing the thoughts and their increasing frequency, and a fear of not being able to ""get out of this grave."" It does not explicitly state that the thoughts themselves are unwanted or intrusive in the sense of ""my brain says X, but I don't want to do X."" Instead, it describes a losing battle against these thoughts and a fear of succumbing to them, which points to personal ideation.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or strongly implied.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current and ongoing struggle with increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts. It does not describe any past initiated suicidal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and notes their increasing frequency (""more and more frequently""). The powerful metaphor ""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" signifies a deep personal struggle with despair and a potential desire for the suffering to end, or a fear of succumbing to suicidal urges. This goes beyond general distress or abstract thoughts. It's not stated that the thoughts are *unwanted* in the sense of being intrusive and not representing a personal desire. Therefore, it fits 'Ideation'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out suicidal actions. Thus, it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated potentially lethal action by the author. Thus, it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a profound sense of hopelessness without any specific plan or past action.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states ""nearly killing myself"" in the past, linked to bullying. It also says ""I fucking hate living"" and ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away."" ""shooting up the school"" is mentioned, but this is an external threat/thought, not self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong despair, hopelessness, anger, resentment (""I hate how my ex-friend..."", ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"", ""I fucking hate living"", ""what the fuck did I do wrong?"", ""Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No current plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The past reference ""nearly killing myself"" does not describe a method or plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""bullied me into nearly killing myself"". This refers to a past state or near-action, but it's ambiguous whether a concrete, initiated action occurred. It could mean being driven to the point of severe ideation.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No current intentions are stated with imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I fucking hate living"" is a very clear and strong expression of a desire for life to end or profound dissatisfaction with being alive. ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"" reinforces this.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""nearly killing myself"" is a direct phrase, referring to a past state.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I fucking hate living"" is a clear expression of this desire.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire ""I fucking hate living"" is not negated.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a *current* suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. The desire is present (""I fucking hate living""), but there is no imminence or vague reference to a *current* action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (""bullied me into nearly killing myself"") and current feelings/desire (""I fucking hate living"", ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" is ambiguous regarding an *initiated action*. It implies being on the verge of, or considering, suicide very strongly, but not necessarily a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that was interrupted or failed. If it had said ""I *tried* to kill myself"" or ""I *attempted* suicide,"" it would clearly be an 'Attempt'. ""Nearly killing myself"" leans more towards intense ideation or being at the brink of an attempt, rather than a described initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The phrase ""I fucking hate living"" is a clear, current, personal expression of a desire for life to end, which fits the 'Ideation' definition.
    *   There is no mention of a *current* plan, method, or preparation, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   The past phrase ""nearly killing myself"" is not explicitly stated as an *initiated action* by the author. It describes being pushed to the brink of suicide, which is very strong ideation, but not definitively an 'Attempt' based on the definition requiring a *specific, self-initiated action*. If the user had stated ""I tried to kill myself"" or ""I attempted suicide,"" it would be an 'Attempt'. The ambiguity of ""nearly killing myself"" prevents it from being definitively classified as an 'Attempt'.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear personal expression of suicidal desire (""I fucking hate living"").

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Ideation' due to the strong current expression of wanting life to end, without a clear current plan/method/preparation, and without a clear description of a past initiated suicidal action.

406,Survived OD. I can hear my mom In the back of my head saying 'you can't kill yourself with ibuprofen' taking down to a show or someone she knew (at this point I can't remember) I feel stupid because I can hear her voice in my head saying it can't be done. When I sat there and swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle. I definitely feel like my OD was like a *rawrxd* why do I feel like that. Why can't my brain just recognize like I could've died. I wouldn't have (in my brain) I wanted to. . I held off going to the hospital for as long as I could. I don't remember giving consent to go but my boyfriend said I did. Not that I could consent to anything (obv) idk I'm still processing everything and still feel weird even Calling it an OD. Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""Survived OD"", ""kill yourself with ibuprofen"", ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle"", ""I could've died"", ""I wanted to"" (referring to the OD). This clearly indicates a past action involving a specific method.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I feel stupid"", ""still processing everything"", ""feel weird"", ""feel bad"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post describes a past event where the author ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle"". This is a specific method and action.
    *   **References to past actions:** The entire post revolves around a past event: ""Survived OD"", ""When I sat there and swallowed..."", ""I held off going to the hospital..."". This is a clear description of a past, initiated action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The core event described is entirely in the past. While the author is currently ""processing everything"" and ""thoughts just pop up"", the action itself is historical.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I wanted to"" (referring to the OD). This indicates a clear desire to die at the time of the described action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and ""I wanted to"" (in the context of the overdose).
    *   Yes, there was a clear desire to die at the time of the described action.
    *   No, the thoughts described are not explicitly stated as unwanted *at the time of the action*. The current processing is about the aftermath of the action.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""120+ pills of ibuprofen"" and ""hard liquor"") was mentioned and used in the past action.
    *   Yes, the act of taking the pills and drinking the liquor constitutes an initiated action and preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past event (""Survived OD"", ""When I sat there and swallowed..."").
    *   It describes a specific, potentially lethal action (""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle"") that was initiated by the author in the past. This clearly fits the definition of an initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post's central theme is the description of a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (an overdose) by the author, with explicit suicidal intent at the time of the action.
    *   This directly aligns with the 'Attempt' definition: ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death"".
    *   Even though the author is currently ""processing"" and having ""thoughts pop up"", the primary content is the description of the past attempt. The rule states: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" Here, the past action is unequivocally described.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' as there is clear intent and a described action.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' as a specific method and initiated action are described.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' as it describes a *past initiated action* rather than a current/future plan or intended action.
    *   Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""totally helpless and misunderstood,"" ""world is just so rotten to me,"" ""sick of every worthless person around me,"" ""All words are meaningless. Every action is malicious."" These indicate profound despair, alienation, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, location), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""quick solution"" is vague and does not detail *how*.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past self-initiated suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" implies a current acceptance or consideration of suicide as a viable option, but does not specify immediate intent (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). It's a current state of mind.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all."" combined with ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" clearly indicates a personal desire for life to end through suicide. The phrase ""I don't even hate myself at all anymore, but I still want to find a way to get away from it all"" reinforces the desire to end things, even if self-hatred is not the primary driver.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""Suicide has become my quick solution.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all."" and ""Suicide has become my quick solution.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the phrasing suggests acceptance of suicide as a solution.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. The phrases ""find a way to get away from it all"" and ""quick solution"" are entirely vague regarding *how* this would be done.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. While desire is present, the imminence is not explicitly high (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). There is no implied physical action or method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of mind and a current consideration/acceptance of suicide as a solution.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end (""I still want to find a way to get away from it all,"" ""Suicide has become my quick solution""). This rules out 'Indicator' as it's not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. The phrases ""find a way"" and ""quick solution"" are too vague to be considered a plan or method. This absence of a concrete plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses clear suicidal intent and desire without any specific plan or action.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in relation to the father's death and states, ""I get suicidal thoughts.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""felt like shit for years now,"" ""reliving the same day everyday,"" ""takes so much energy,"" ""can't stop thinking about it."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, and preoccupation.

While they follow this with ""but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it,"" this is a statement about perceived inability to act, not a negation of the thoughts themselves or an explicit statement that they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to die. The thoughts are acknowledged as personal and present. The feeling that suicide ""just makes it seem like it's inevitable for me"" also suggests an internalization of suicidal ideation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? The presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" combined with long-term despair (""felt like shit for years"") and the feeling of inevitability (""makes it seem like it's inevitable for me"") strongly implies a desire for life to end, even if the intent to act is questioned by the author.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The phrase ""im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" indicates a perceived lack of ability to act, not an explicit rejection of the thoughts themselves or a desire for them to stop. The thoughts are acknowledged as present and personal.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (father's suicide) and current feelings/thoughts (""felt like shit for years,"" ""get suicidal thoughts"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The mention of suicide refers to the father's past action, not the author's.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""I get suicidal thoughts."" This moves it beyond general distress.
    - The qualifying statement (""im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"") expresses a perceived barrier to acting on the thoughts, but does not negate the presence of the thoughts themselves or explicitly state they are unwanted. The thoughts are acknowledged as personal and present.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action by the author, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the presence of explicit ""suicidal thoughts"" without a plan or past attempt best fits 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""i wanna off myself"" and ""if i killed myself"". No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared,"" ""can't see it getting better,"" ""fucking hate it here,"" ""fucking shit i feel."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and fear.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means):** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions being ""diagnosed with depression and seeing a therapist"" and having ""lived like this longer than living without it"" (referring to depression), but no past suicidal actions or attempts.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The desire ""i wanna off myself"" is stated, but immediately followed by ""but i'm scared"" and ""i just wanna hang onto that string of hope."" There is no indication of immediate imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The ambivalence reduces the perceived imminence of action.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear stated desire to ""off myself."" However, this is immediately qualified by fear of missing out and a desire to hold onto hope that things will get better. The writer does not state that the suicidal thoughts are *unwanted*; rather, they are conflicted about *acting* on them due to fear and a glimmer of hope. The desire to die is present, but heavily ambivalent.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""i wanna off myself,"" ""if i killed myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""i wanna off myself.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer expresses fear about the *consequences* of acting and a desire for things to get better, indicating ambivalence about acting. However, they do not state that the *thoughts* themselves are unwanted. The desire to ""off myself"" is presented as a genuine, albeit conflicted, personal desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. There is no high imminence; the desire is heavily qualified by fear and hope. There is no vague reference to an intended action beyond the initial statement of desire.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention (""i wanna off myself"") that is conflicted. It also discusses past mental health struggles and therapy.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""i wanna off myself""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not merely general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts; it's a stated personal desire, even with ambivalence.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'. While the desire is present, the lack of any concrete ""how"" or ""when"" (beyond an unspecific future) means it doesn't meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The ambivalence further supports this.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear personal desire to die but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation.

I haven't grow since last year and to make it worse im only 4'11 feet and the height requirements for runway models are 5'7 to 5'8 or 9. I feel so hopeless with myself that's why i want to give up my life and just die. And that's not the only reason, all my friends are getting taller then me and i am losing my self esteem very fast.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I want to give up my life and just die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE,"" ""If I live I know I will never be happy with myself and if I die I know my parents would be devastated,"" ""the suicidal thoughts are like eating me up.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hopeless,"" ""never be happy,"" ""losing my self esteem,"" ""I hate myself,"" ""I feel trapped,"" ""no future for me,"" ""devastated"" (for parents).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The thoughts are described as ""eating me up"" ""as I'm writing this,"" indicating current and overwhelming ideation. However, no immediate action is stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, explicit personal desire to die (""I want to give up my life and just die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE""). The conflict with not wanting to devastate parents is present, but it does not negate the personal desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to give up my life and just die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"").
    *   The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them in a way that would make it 'Indicator'. The thoughts are distressing *because* they are overwhelming and represent a genuine desire to die, despite the conflict with parental impact.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   There is no vague reference to action implying a method or plan. The focus is solely on the desire to die and the overwhelming thoughts.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and intentions (""I want to give up my life,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE,"" ""as I'm writing this my mind is becoming more worse"").
    *   It does not describe any past specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""I want to give up my life and just die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE""). This clearly places it beyond 'Indicator', as it's a personal desire, not just abstract distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly, as it expresses a clear personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts without any concrete plan or action.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""cutting my self for a long time"" - self-harm, described as a coping mechanism (""to subvert the pain to a physical one"").
        *   ""contemplating suicide"" - explicit suicidal ideation by the author.
        *   ""she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide"" - *another person's* suicide attempt. This is noted but not relevant for the author's classification.
        *   ""she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide"" - *another person's* suicidal thoughts.
        *   ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" - explicit suicide pact, indicating a shared plan/intended action.
        *   ""I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it."" - clear, strong personal intent to die, linked to a specific condition (her being gone). ""I'm ending it"" implies a future suicidal action.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""numb,"" ""don't get any joy out of life,"" ""don't feel love for anyone,"" ""fucking lost.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" - This is a clear agreement for a future suicidal act, constituting a plan/intended action.
        *   ""I'm ending it"" - While not a specific method, this is a direct statement of intent to act in a suicidal manner, conditional on the other person's status.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""cutting my self for a long time"" and ""my body is covered in scars"" refer to past self-harm, explicitly stated as for pain diversion, not as a past suicidal attempt.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The intention is conditional (""if she gone"") but clearly stated as a definitive future action (""I'm ending it"").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die (""I didn't want to live before I met her,"" ""I'm ending it"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""contemplating suicide,"" and the author states ""I'm ending it"" and ""I didn't want to live.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/for life to end.
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions; rather, they express a clear desire to act on them under a specific condition.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific plan/intended action is mentioned: ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together."" This is a suicide pact, which is a form of planning/preparation for a suicidal act.
    *   The phrase ""I'm ending it"" also indicates a clear intention to act. While a specific method isn't detailed, the agreement for a shared act and the strong statement of intent elevate this beyond mere ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes past self-harm, but critically, it describes *current and future intentions* regarding suicide (""contemplating suicide,"" ""we agreed... we will do it together,"" ""I'm ending it"").
    *   The post *does not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past that was intended to end their life. The cutting is described as self-mutilation for pain, not a suicide attempt. The only attempt mentioned is by the other person.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit personal suicidal intent and desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is more than just thoughts; there is a clear agreement for a shared suicidal act (""we will do it together"") and a definitive statement of intended action (""I'm ending it""), which moves it into the 'Behavior' category.
    *   **Behavior:** This is the best fit. There is clear suicidal intent (""I'm ending it,"" ""contemplating suicide,"" ""didn't want to live"") *and* a clear mention of a plan/intended action (the suicide pact: ""we agreed... we will do it together""). The imminence is conditional but strong.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the author does not describe a past self-initiated suicidal action. The cutting is described as self-harm, not an attempt, and the only attempt mentioned is by another person.

    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've fucking tried"" refers to trying to move on, not a suicidal action. No past suicidal actions are mentioned.

    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""Life isn't worth it without her,"" ""I need to die because it's better than living in pain.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer validates and expresses a personal desire for death.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The imminence is not extremely high (no ""tonight,"" ""now""), and there is no vague reference to action beyond the desire to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current desire/intention to die.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""I need to die,"" ""Life isn't worth it,"" ""kill yourself? It's perfectly reasonable""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a clear personal suicidal intent.

To be continued.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post contains numerous quotes from the parents that directly refer to the author's past suicidal actions or self-harm: ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"". The parents also suggest methods: ""take a gun and kill yourself"", ""Just shoot yourself already"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The entire post is a recounting of severe emotional and psychological abuse, invalidation, and neglect from the parents. This context strongly implies profound distress, hopelessness, and a sense of worthlessness on the part of the author. The author's own question ""Dad, If you are treating me like this, why did you want to have a daughter in the first place"" highlights deep pain and questioning of their existence.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No current plans, methods, or preparations are stated by the author. The methods mentioned (gun, cutting wrists) are in the context of parental suggestions or references to past actions.
    *   **References to past actions:** Yes, there are explicit references to the author's past self-initiated actions: ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"". These are framed as questions from the parents, but they clearly describe past suicidal attempts and self-harm by the author.
    *   **Imminence:** No imminence for a current action is stated by the author.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer does not explicitly state a current desire to die or suicidal intent. However, the sharing of these quotes, particularly those referencing past attempts, indicates that these past actions and the underlying distress are highly relevant to their current state.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post does not contain a direct statement from the author like ""I want to kill myself"" or ""I want to die.""
    *   However, the repeated references to the author's *past attempts* (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"") are crucial. While the author doesn't explicitly state *current* suicidal desire, they are bringing up a history of *initiated* suicidal actions.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No current plan, method, or preparation is stated by the author. The methods mentioned are in the context of past actions or parental suggestions.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes past events (the quotes) that include clear descriptions of the author's *past self-initiated potentially lethal actions* (""try to kill yourself again,"" ""cut your wrists again""). The use of ""again"" implies multiple instances.
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' explicitly states: ""The content describes **past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal...** This includes attempts described as historical (e.g., ""many years ago"") if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" The author is sharing these quotes, thereby bringing up their history of attempts in the context of their current distress from parental abuse.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   This is not 'Indicator' because it goes beyond general distress; it explicitly mentions past suicidal actions by the author.
    *   This is not 'Ideation' because while the author is clearly in distress, they do not explicitly state *current* suicidal thoughts or desire to die. More importantly, the post contains descriptions of *past initiated actions*.
    *   This is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a *current* plan, method, or preparation by the author.
    *   This fits the 'Attempt' category because the post clearly describes the author's *past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions* (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?""). The author is recounting these quotes, which serve as evidence of these past attempts and are presented within the context of their ongoing struggle. The definition of 'Attempt' covers historical attempts if the author brings them up in relation to their current state.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""kill yourself,"" ""Kim's"" (likely a typo for ""kill myself""). The user is explicitly asking for methods (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?"").
    - Emotional indicators: Desperation (""I just need a way""), dismissive of help (""don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit""), seeking a direct answer.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: The post is a direct request for a method. This implies an active search for a plan/means to carry out a suicidal act.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The phrase ""I just need a way"" and the urgency in ""someone just give me a straight up answer"" suggest high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear, strong desire to die and find a method to achieve it. The user is not expressing distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts; rather, they are expressing a desire to act on them and seeking means.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill yourself,"" ""Kim's"" (kill myself).
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, by directly asking for a method to kill themselves.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite; they are actively seeking a way to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? The user is *asking* for a specific method (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""). While they haven't stated they *have* a method, the act of actively seeking one is a clear indication of planning or preparing to act. This is a step beyond just thinking about it.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Actively seeking information on methods is a form of preparation.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Here, the explicit question for a ""way to kill yourself"" is a direct request for a method/plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention. The user ""needs a way"" now to act in the future.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator:** Not applicable. There is a clear, personal, and desired suicidal intent.
    - **Ideation:** While there is clear ideation (desire to die, suicidal thoughts), the post goes beyond mere thoughts/desire. The user is actively seeking a *method* or *plan* (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""). This active search for means/methods moves it out of Ideation.
    - **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die (""kill yourself,"" ""need a way to Kim's"") AND actively seeks a specific method/plan (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""). The act of asking for a method is a clear indication of seeking to carry out the act by finding a means, which falls under planning or intended action.
    - **Attempt:** Not applicable. No past initiated action is described.

Conclusion: The post clearly expresses suicidal intent and actively seeks a method/plan, which aligns with 'Behavior'.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The phrase ""suicidal note"" directly refers to suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside"" indicates severe emotional and/or physical distress, suggesting profound suffering and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again."" This is a clear statement of intent to engage in a preparatory action for suicide. Writing a suicide note is a recognized preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""again"" implies that the author has written a suicidal note or contemplated doing so in the past. This reinforces the seriousness of the current intention.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I think I'm going to"" suggests a current intention to act in the near future.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The intention to write a suicidal note, coupled with intense internal pain, strongly implies a desire for life to end or to act on suicidal thoughts. It is not presented as an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal note"" is a direct reference to suicide.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While not explicitly stating ""I want to die,"" the intention to write a suicidal note, driven by intense internal pain, strongly implies a desire to end their life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the phrasing ""I think I'm going to write..."" indicates an intention to act, not a rejection of the thoughts.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method of suicide (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""writing a suicidal note"" is a direct and explicit sign of preparation for a suicidal act. This falls under the definition of 'preparations being taken'.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. While no *method of death* is stated, the *preparation* of writing a note is explicitly mentioned. This is a concrete step.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""I think I'm going to write..."") and references a past similar action (""again"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, it describes the *intention to prepare* by writing a note, not a past *attempted lethal action*. The ""again"" refers to writing the note, not a past suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is a clear personal expression of suicidal intent (preparing a note) and severe distress, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire; it explicitly mentions a specific *preparation* (""write a suicidal note"").
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post expresses suicidal intent (implied by the preparation and pain) and explicitly mentions a concrete *preparation* for suicide (""write a suicidal note""). This is a step taken towards a suicidal act, even if the ultimate method isn't specified.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The post describes a *future preparation* (""I think I'm going to write..."") and references past *preparations* (""again""), but not a past *initiated lethal action* (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself"").

The presence of a clear preparation (""write a suicidal note"") moves this beyond Ideation into Behavior.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The phrase ""slaying myself"" is a direct and explicit expression of suicidal intent. The first part ""committing a massacre"" refers to violence towards others, but the classification is for the author's suicide risk.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post doesn't explicitly state emotions like hopelessness, but the content itself (considering self-harm as an alternative to a massacre) suggests severe distress or a dark state of mind.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""gun,"" ""bridge""), or preparation (e.g., ""note,"" ""acquiring means"") is mentioned for ""slaying myself."" ""Slaying"" implies a violent method, but it's not a specific tool or action.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I will end up..."" suggests a future intention, but not immediate imminence like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It's a statement of potential future action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""slaying myself"" clearly indicates a personal desire to die or end their life. It is not presented as an unwanted thought.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""slaying myself"" is a direct phrase indicating self-killing.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""slaying myself"" expresses a clear desire to end their own life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is stated as a potential future action, not an unwanted thought.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. While ""slaying"" implies a violent act, it lacks specificity (e.g., ""gun,"" ""knife,"" ""jump""). It's a general statement of intent rather than a specific method or plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The imminence is not high (""I will end up..."" is future, not immediate), and the method is vague. This does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""I will end up..."").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die (""slaying myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, detailed method, or preparation for carrying out the suicidal act. While ""slaying"" implies a method, it is not specific enough to qualify for 'Behavior' (e.g., it doesn't mention ""how"" beyond the general act of ""slaying,"" nor any tools or locations).
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'Ideation', as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/desire without a specific plan, method, or preparation.

418,"I wish I had friends. I wish I had friends so badly. I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Expresses feelings of laziness, shame, feeling stupid, feeling outclassed, intimidation, and being overwhelmed. Mentions a desire for friends, a girlfriend, and willpower to overcome laziness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** Failed three classes in high school, consistently scored high on standardized tests, daydreamed for a year about getting temps, didn't attend a protest. No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No suicidal intentions are stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Explicitly states, ""As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" This is a crucial clarification.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""suicidal ideation.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. On the contrary, it explicitly states, ""I don't want to die— I want to live.""
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Yes. The statement ""I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody"" clearly indicates that the ""suicidal ideation"" is an unwanted manifestation (stemming from shame) rather than a genuine desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied for a suicidal act.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings of distress and past experiences (e.g., failing classes, daydreaming).
    *   It does *not* describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author, either in the past or currently.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post mentions ""suicidal ideation,"" which might initially suggest 'Ideation'. However, the critical clarifying sentence, ""As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody,"" directly aligns with the 'Indicator' definition.
    *   The 'Indicator' definition states: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The author explicitly negates the desire to die and attributes the ideation to shame, not a genuine wish for death.
    *   There is no plan, method, or intended action, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Because the author explicitly states a desire to live and clarifies that the suicidal ideation is unwanted/stems from shame rather than a genuine desire to die, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate classification.

I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""shoot myself in the head,"" ""don't die,"" ""suicide hotline."" Specific method: ""dad's handgun.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hesitation (due to fear of disability), rejection of help (""not calling a suicide hotline"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head."" This is a clear statement of a desired action with a specific tool and method.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I wanna get... and shoot myself"" indicates a current desire/intention, even if followed by a caveat.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** The initial statement ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"" expresses a clear desire to die. The subsequent hesitation is about the *outcome* (disability), not a negation of the desire to end life itself. The individual is weighing the risks of the chosen method, not expressing that they don't want to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""shoot myself in the head,"" and reference to ""suicide hotline.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"" clearly expresses a desire to end their life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. The writer expresses a desire to act, but is hesitant about a specific negative *consequence* (disability) of the chosen method, not about the desire to die itself. This is not an ""unwanted thoughts"" scenario.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""dad's handgun"" and ""shoot myself in the head"" are very specific method and tool.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation (like acquiring the gun or writing a note) is mentioned, but the statement ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself"" describes an *intended action* with a *specific method*.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Here, the method is not vague; it's explicitly stated. The hesitation is about the *risk of failure*, not the absence of a plan or desire.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention (""I wanna get... and shoot myself"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, this is not a description of a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and mentions explicit suicidal intent (""shoot myself in the head""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by specifying a *method* (""dad's handgun"") and an *intended action* (""shoot myself in the head""). This moves it past 'Ideation', which is defined by the *absence* of a specific plan, method, or intended action.
    *   While there is hesitation, it is about the *outcome* (disability) of the chosen method, not a negation of the desire to die or the contemplation of the action itself. The plan and method are clearly articulated.
    *   There is no description of a *past initiated action* by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific method and intended action fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post states ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""If my breathing doesn't go back to normal I can't see myself having a life worth living."" These are strong expressions of a desire for life to end or a belief that life is valueless. No explicit mention of suicide or self-harm, nor any specific methods.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Fuck this World,"" ""unbearable,"" ""helpless, angry and sad,"" ""nothing i can enjoy anymore,"" ""I hate this world. I hate how this world works.

    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No immediate stated intentions to act. The despair is conditional (""If my breathing doesn't go back to normal..."").
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear stated desire that their life is not worth living, which implies a desire for life to end or for them not to be alive. They are not expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts; rather, they are expressing a genuine personal sentiment about the value of their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes. ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"" clearly express a desire for their current life to end or a belief that it holds no value, which is a form of suicidal ideation.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the statements are expressions of their personal belief/desire, not unwanted thoughts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound despair and a clear personal belief that ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living.""

    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated potentially lethal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon,"" ""I'll be gone.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""don't see the point anymore,"" hopelessness, despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) or concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note, saying goodbye in a specific way) are mentioned. ""I hope I believe behind something good"" is a general sentiment, not a concrete preparation for a specific act.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""soon,"" ""by February."" This indicates a future intention with a timeframe, but not immediate (like ""tonight"" or ""now"").
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire to die, expressed through ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon"" and ""don't see the point anymore.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases: Yes, ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon.""
    - Expresses a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end: Yes, ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon,"" ""I'll be gone,"" ""don't see the point anymore.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them: No, the desire is clearly stated as the author's intention.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied: No.
    - Are there signs of preparation: No concrete preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""I hope I believe behind something good"" is a general wish, not a preparatory action for suicide.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: The imminence is ""soon"" / ""by February"", which is not immediate. There is no vague reference to *how* the action will be carried out, only the outcome (""I'll be gone"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both: It describes a future intention (""I think I'm going to kill myself soon,"" ""by February I think I'll be gone"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past: No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator': The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (""I think I'm going to kill myself soon,"" ""I'll be gone,"" ""don't see the point anymore""). It's not general distress, abstract discussion, or unwanted thoughts.
    - Not 'Behavior': While there is clear suicidal ideation and intent, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action (even vague but with high imminence), or concrete preparations. The timeframe ""by February"" is not immediate enough to infer a vague action from high imminence alone without any other indication of *how*.
    - Not 'Attempt': There is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

    Therefore, the post expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life, but without any specific plan, method, or preparations. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

    *   While there is high intent and a timeframe (""this month""), there is no indication of *how* the act will be carried out (no plan, method, or intended action beyond the general statement of ""end my life""). The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations being taken."" The post lacks this specific element.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a future intention (""gonna end my life this month"").
    *   It does not describe any past initiated, potentially lethal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal intent (""I just want to die"", ""gonna end my life""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts; it's a direct, personal expression of suicidal desire.
    *   The post does *not* mention a specific plan, method, intended action (beyond the general ""end my life""), or preparations. The phrase ""gonna end my life this month"" expresses intent and imminence, but lacks the concrete *how* required for 'Behavior'. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a *specific* plan, method, or intended action. Without this, it remains 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated action, so 'Attempt' is ruled out.
    *   Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/desire to die without any specific plan, method, or preparations mentioned.

423,"Why people still want to have kids in this shitty modern world?. I mean they don't understand that the world is falling apart and soon will turn into hell? Isn't it obvious?

If you are mental ill or suicidal and still want kids go for it I won't judge, you may be a good parent",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""suffering,"" ""mental illnesses,"" ""pessimistic,"" ""hate.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No specific past *actions* are mentioned, only the past/ongoing *presence* of ""suicidal thoughts"" which ""helped me to understood the world."" This is not a past attempt.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No imminence is stated. The post is reflective rather than expressing immediate intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer states they have ""suicidal thoughts."" They do not explicitly state a desire to die in this post, nor do they state that these thoughts are unwanted. The mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" directly indicates ideation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Not directly, but the explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" implies the presence of such ideation.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, they do not negate the thoughts; rather, they frame them as a source of understanding. This means it's not 'Indicator' based on the ""explicitly unwanted"" clause.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - No plan, method, or preparation is identified.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" as something that has influenced their understanding, indicating an ongoing or past state of having these thoughts. It does not describe a future intention to act.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. It only mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" not a past attempt or initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts."" This falls under the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings.""
    - It does not explicitly state these thoughts are unwanted; in fact, it attributes a positive outcome (""helped me to understood the world"") to them, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated potentially lethal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

424,"As much as I hate it, suicide genuinely seems like the only solution. I feel like I've tried everything at this point. It just feels like nothings gonna work. And it's getting to the point where I consider checking myself into a hospital multiple times a day. Honestly, maybe I wasn't cut out for life. That's what it feels like at least. I'm done being this sad fucked up person. If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out. It feels like only viable solution",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself."" No specific method or means is mentioned, but there's a clear statement about ""plenty of time to plan it out.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hate it,"" ""sad fucked up person,"" ""done being this sad,"" ""nothings gonna work,"" ""wasn't cut out for life,"" ""only solution,"" ""only viable solution."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and a belief that life is unbearable.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method or preparation is detailed. However, the phrase ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out"" indicates a firm intention to *formulate a plan* and execute it at a specific future time. This is a commitment to a future action involving planning.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The action is set for a future date (""on my birthday""), which is not immediate. However, the intent to ""plan it out"" is present *now*.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, genuine desire for life to end via suicide, expressed as the ""only solution"" and ""only viable solution.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution,"" ""I wasn't cut out for life,"" ""I'm done being this sad fucked up person,"" ""It feels like only viable solution"").
    *   No, the writer does not state they do not want these thoughts or actions. On the contrary, they embrace them as a solution.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned.
    *   No explicit signs of preparation (like ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills"") are mentioned yet.
    *   However, the statement ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out"" is a crucial element. While it doesn't detail *what* the plan is, it signifies a concrete intention to *develop and execute a plan* for suicide. This moves beyond mere ideation (thoughts/desire) into a stated intention to act by planning. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide."" The intent to ""plan it out"" fits this.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current state of despair and a future intention to act (""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday"").
    *   It does not describe any past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a personal, current desire to die and explicit suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and desire (Ideation). Crucially, it also includes the phrase ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out."" This is not just a thought about suicide; it's a stated intention to *formulate a plan* and act on it at a future date. While the specific method is not detailed, the commitment to ""plan it out"" constitutes an element of future planning for a suicidal act. This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition, which includes mentioning ""a plan to commit suicide."" It's a step beyond just thinking about it; it's a decision to move towards action via planning.
    *   **Behavior vs. Attempt:** There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent and the stated intention to ""plan it out"" for a future date, this falls under 'Behavior' because it indicates a commitment to developing and executing a suicidal plan, even if the specific details are not yet formed or disclosed.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrase ""ending it all"" is present, which is a common euphemism for suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses profound feelings of being a ""darkness,"" ""failure,"" ""world worst son, brother, cousin, and uncle,"" ""total failure,"" ""don't deserve love or happiness,"" ""deserve pain and loneliness,"" and a ""Burden on my family."" There's also a sense of hopelessness (""what is the point anymore"") and isolation (""fighting this battle alone"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""Now I've been thinking of ending it all"" indicates current, ongoing thoughts. ""Now I'm just fighting this battle alone. So what is the point anymore"" reinforces the present state of despair and ideation.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer clearly expresses a desire for life to end (""thinking of ending it all,"" ""what is the point anymore""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or intrusive; they are presented as the writer's current personal struggle and conclusion.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""ending it all"" strongly implies a desire to die.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""thinking of ending it all"" and ""what is the point anymore"" clearly convey this.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the thoughts are expressed as part of their current personal struggle and despair.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. While intent and imminence are present (""Now I've been thinking of ending it all""), there is no ""how"" or any action implied beyond the thought itself. It's ""thinking of ending it all,"" not ""thinking of doing X to end it all.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current thoughts and feelings (""Now I've been thinking,"" ""Now I'm just fighting"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because it contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal ideation (""thinking of ending it all,"" ""what is the point anymore"") and a profound desire for life to end, without negating these thoughts.
    *   It does not mention any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations, which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe any past initiated suicidal action, which distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""get it over with,"" ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend,"" ""my death will be following very soon too."" These phrases clearly indicate suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I feel kind of sorry for my mom though,"" ""I hope she learns to cope well"" - shows some thought for others, but framed within the context of the author's impending death.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" indicates an intended action and timeframe. ""It's probably best if I get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents"" is a clear preparation for death.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""this weekend,"" ""very soon too."" High imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die and end life: ""I want to do this once and for all. I want to get it over with.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""attempt"" in the context of a future action and ""my death will be following very soon too.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die: ""I want to do this once and for all. I want to get it over with.""
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts; the desire is personal and present.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - A specific method is not mentioned (e.g., pills, gun).
    - However, there are strong signs of preparation: ""It's probably best if I get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents."" This is a concrete step taken in preparation for death.
    - The phrase ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" indicates a clear intended action, even if the specific method is vague. Coupled with the preparation of a will and high imminence, this points to Behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a future intention (""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"").
    - It does not describe a past, initiated, potentially lethal action. The word ""attempt"" here refers to a future planned action, not a past completed one.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and end life (""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I want to get it over with""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning an intended future action (""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"") and a concrete preparation for death (""get a will in place""). This rules out 'Ideation'.
    - The action described (""attempt this weekend"") is a future intention, not a past initiated action. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I don't wanna die"", ""waste money to then die right after"", ""cannot live if i fail"", ""no place to jump from"", ""blades i used to cut won't go that deep"".
    - Emotional indicators: ""for the first time i don't wanna die"", ""almost happy"", ""almost enjoying doing stuff"", ""feeling better nonetheless"", ""decent place right now"", ""have a purpose"". There is also conditional despair (""cannot live if i fail"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states a LACK of means/methods (""no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep""). The preparations mentioned are for *living* (making plans to move, new room, projects).
    - References to past actions: ""blades i used to cut"" implies past self-harm. The phrase ""won't go that deep"" suggests these were not lethal attempts, but rather non-lethal self-harm. There is no description of a past *initiated potentially lethal action*.
    - Imminence: The post emphasizes a current state of *not* wanting to die (""for the first time i don't wanna die"") and future-oriented plans for living. The ""final test"" is a future trigger, but the current sentiment is positive.
    - Stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""for the first time i don't wanna die"". While they also say ""it's not like i wanna live either but i have stuff to do"", the overwhelming sentiment of the rest of the post is finding reasons to live, feeling better, and wanting to continue doing things. The conditional ""cannot live if i fail"" is a source of distress, but it's framed within a current desire *not* to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No, it explicitly states ""for the first time i don't wanna die"". The post describes a shift *away* from suicidal desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""for the first time i don't wanna die"" directly negates a desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No, the post explicitly states a *lack* of these (""no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep"").
    - Are there signs of preparation? No, preparations mentioned are for living (moving, new room).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current positive shift in mindset (""for the first time i don't wanna die"", ""feeling better"") and future plans for living. It references past self-harm (""blades i used to cut"") but not a past suicide *attempt*.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. The past cutting is described in a way that implies it was not a lethal attempt (""won't go that deep"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly states ""I don't wanna die"" and describes a current state of finding reasons to live and feeling better. While there's a conditional statement of despair (""cannot live if i fail"") and a reference to past self-harm/suicidal thoughts, the *current* personal suicidal intent is explicitly negated. The post is about overcoming suicidal feelings and finding purpose, rather than expressing current suicidal desire or plans. This fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress/past struggles but *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author*, and explicitly states they do not want to die.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""drained me the fuck out of all my motivation,"" ""useless,"" ""taken my will to strive,"" ""stuck in a system,"" ""exhausted and thrown out,"" ""neverending process only helps the things I hate the most,"" ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, and a feeling of being trapped and directionless.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: No past suicidal actions mentioned.
    - Imminence of intentions: ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" indicates a current state of distress and feeling lost, but not an imminent suicidal intention.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses extreme exhaustion, lack of motivation, feeling useless, and a sense of being trapped in a system that drains them. ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" signifies a profound loss of purpose and direction, but it does *not* explicitly state a desire to die or for life to end. It's a statement of being utterly lost and overwhelmed, not a direct suicidal wish.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. While there is deep despair and a feeling of being ""exhausted and thrown out"" and ""don't know what to do anymore with my life,"" this is a statement of profound distress and feeling directionless, not an explicit desire for death or an end to life. It does not contain phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't here.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:

    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly indicates general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed and lost.
    - It *lacks* any explicit personal expression of desire to die or clear suicidal intent. The phrase ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" signifies a crisis of purpose and extreme distress, but it is not equivalent to a desire for life to end or for death.
    - There are no mentions of suicidal thoughts (explicitly wanted or unwanted), plans, methods, or past attempts.
    - Based on the definitions, the post expresses profound distress and hopelessness, but without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""kill myself,"" ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out,"" ""shoot myself with a gun,"" and ""start cutting myself."" Also expresses a desire to die (""net gain for the world if i die,"" ""I'm just waiting for the end,"" ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""failed,"" ""failure,"" ""toxic family,"" ""depression,"" ""fear,"" ""regret,"" ""worthlessness,"" ""dumbass,"" ""lazy asshole,"" ""hate myself,"" ""sad,"" ""not strong enough."" Indicates profound despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** Mentions specific methods (""slitting my wrist,"" ""shoot myself with a gun""). Mentions a conditional plan (""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do""), indicating readiness to act even without a specific location. Detailed thoughts about the aftermath (""My body probably wouldn't be found for months,"" ""if im far enough away and cut off enough"") suggest a degree of planning or consideration for the act.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do."" ""I'm just waiting for the end."" ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold."" This indicates high imminence and readiness to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** A clear and strong desire to die and to act on suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""I want help so badly. But im afraid"" expresses ambivalence and fear, but does not negate the strong, stated desire and intention to die with specific methods.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to die,"" ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer explicitly states they *do* want to act (""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, specific methods are listed: ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out,"" ""shoot myself with a gun.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"" indicates a conditional plan, but the ""even if I don't"" part suggests readiness to act without that specific condition. The detailed thoughts about the body not being found for months also suggest a degree of planning for the act's consequences.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Here, the methods are explicit, not vague.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do,"" ""I'm just waiting for the end"").

    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die and suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by mentioning specific methods (""slitting my wrist,"" ""shoot myself with a gun"") and a clear intention to act (""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes a plan/method/intended action.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification due to the explicit suicidal intent combined with specific methods and a stated intention to act.

430,"I finally understand it all. I had doubts, I kept faith, but it's true. This world is shit, the people around me are out to get me. I don't understand why they think it's so fun to play with my emotions. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I have abandonment issues and I'm studying psychology, pretending like I want to become a psychologist, so that I can solve my own problems. I'm 6'1 195 lbs., I genuinely enjoy working out and playing all kinds of sports. But whenever I confront someone about something my voice shakes. This girl is literally playing the fuck out of me and I don't know what to do. Is it true? Do you have to choose money or love? I thought I could do both why didn't someone tell me the truth? If I knew it was true the choice is fucking obvious?. God am I just paranoid as fuck? Obviously but like how do I know which 'delusions' are real fuck dude I just want someone to goddamn love me why am I so unlovable wtf dude I want to cry my damn eyes out right now, I seriously don't know what's real. I think I have PTSD from my breakup and I think I'm projecting but what if I'm not? What if this really is the world we live in, for the love of god SOMEONE TELL ME THE DAMN TRUTH!",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
    - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means (even if vague).
        - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.
    - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, being a burden, hating life, etc.).
        - ""This world is shit,"" ""people around me are out to get me,"" ""don't understand why they think it's so fun to play with my emotions,"" ""don't know what I'm doing wrong,"" ""abandonment issues,"" ""my voice shakes,"" ""This girl is literally playing the fuck out of me,"" ""don't know what to do,"" ""God am I just paranoid as fuck?"", ""why am I so unlovable,"" ""want to cry my damn eyes out right now,"" ""seriously don't know what's real,"" ""think I have PTSD,"" ""projecting,"" ""SOMEONE TELL ME THE DAMN TRUTH!"" These indicate significant emotional distress, feelings of being targeted/misunderstood, self-doubt, paranoia, confusion, and a sense of being unloved.
    - Look for specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means).
        - None mentioned.
    - Check for references to past actions, including those initiated but not completed. Note the timeframe if mentioned (e.g., ""yesterday,"" ""last year"").
        - Mentions ""PTSD from my breakup"" but not a past suicidal action.
    - Note the imminence of any stated intentions (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon,"" ""planning to"").
        - No stated intentions related to suicide.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: Is there a genuine wish to die or for life to end, or are they expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts?
        - The writer expresses a desire for love (""I just want someone to goddamn love me"") and for clarity/truth (""I seriously don't know what's real,"" ""SOMEONE TELL ME THE DAMN TRUTH!""). There is no stated desire to die or for life to end. The distress is profound but focused on external circumstances, relationships, and their own mental state (paranoia, PTSD, unlovability).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? (Yes/No)
        - No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., ""I want to be gone,"" ""I want it to be over,"" ""I hate living,"" ""life isn't worth it,"" ""I'm going to die soon"" in a context of despair)? (Yes/No)
        - No. While there is profound despair and confusion about life, there is no direct expression of wanting to die or for life to end. Phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them (e.g., ""my brain says X, but I don't want to"")? This strongly leans towards 'Indicator' if the primary sentiment is distress about the thoughts themselves, rather than a desire to die.
        - Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act?
        - No.
    - Are there signs of preparation (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills,"" ""saying goodbye"")?
        - No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context. This is important for Behavior.
        - Not applicable, as there is no explicit desire to die.
    - If there's a desire to die but no indication of plan/method/preparation (even considering the point above), it's likely 'Ideation'. If there is *any* mention of a method, preparation, or intended action (even if vague but coupled with strong intent/imminence), it leans towards 'Behavior'.
        - Not applicable, as there is no desire to die.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?
        - Describes current feelings of distress, paranoia, confusion, and past breakup/PTSD.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past (e.g., ""I took pills but woke up,"" ""I tried to [method] but stopped,"" ""when I overdosed X years ago,"" ""attempted suicide before"")?
        - No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
    - The post expresses significant emotional distress, feelings of being targeted, paranoia, confusion, and self-worth issues (""why am I so unlovable""). It mentions mental health concerns like PTSD and abandonment issues.
    - However, it *does not* contain any explicit statements of suicidal intent, a desire to die, or for life to end. There are no mentions of plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions.
    - The core desire expressed is for love and understanding, not for death.
    - This content aligns with the definition of 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and mental health struggles, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. It does not meet the criteria for Ideation (no explicit desire to die), Behavior (no plan/method), or Attempt (no past action).

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment.""), guilt, feeling like a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, detailed. Ingesting isopropyl alcohol, testing noose attachment points, figuring out how to avoid detection during an attempt. Explicitly states ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions having suicidal thoughts for years, but no past *initiated attempts*.
    *   **Imminence:** ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide."" ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself."" However, the author explicitly states a strong protective factor: ""But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me... I must remain and suffer."" This indicates a current *desire* and *plans*, but a current *lack of intent to act* due to a specific belief.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""I want to die because I hate myself""). This desire is *not* stated as unwanted; rather, the *action* is being withheld due to a personal conviction.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""I want to die"").
    *   The writer does *not* state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them in the sense of being distressed by the thoughts themselves. Instead, they state a reason for *not acting* on the desire/plans (""I don't deserve to,"" ""I must remain and suffer""). The desire and thoughts are clearly present and accepted by the author as part of their current state. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, specific methods are mentioned: ""calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest,"" ""tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose,"" ""figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me."" The author explicitly states, ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself."" This clearly indicates a plan, method, and preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current contemplation and existing plans (""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans.""). It also refers to past *ideation* (""suicidal thoughts for years,"" ""constant companion for years"").
    *   It does *not* describe a past or very recent *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author. The detailed methods are described as having been *contemplated* and *devised*, not *acted upon*. The author explicitly states, ""But I don't do it."" This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes significantly beyond mere ideation by detailing specific methods (isopropyl alcohol, noose, jumping in front of a car) and preparations (avoiding detection), and explicitly stating ""I have the plans."" This presence of specific plans and methods, even with a current stated reason for *not* acting on them, fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The plans are concrete and current.
    *   There is no description of an initiated suicidal action by the author, ruling out 'Attempt'.

The presence of clear suicidal desire and detailed, current plans/methods/preparations, despite a stated reason for not acting *at this moment*, aligns with the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly states ""the day i chose is very soon,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade."" It also says ""I'm not cut out for life and I can't even imagine mine being worth living."" No specific method is mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tensions are really high and everything is fucked up in my family,"" ""selfish and weak.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates a chosen time. The discussion about ""calling my grandparents,"" ""telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother,"" and the concern about whether this would ""haunt people more or something"" are strong indicators of *preparatory thoughts* related to making final goodbyes or contacts before an intended act. While not a physical method, these are considerations of actions to take *before* the suicidal act.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to long-standing ideation, not a past initiated attempt.
    *   **Imminence:** ""the day i chose is very soon"" signifies high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, explicit desire to die and a rejection of intervention: ""I'm not interested in being talked down at all,"" ""I'm not at all interested in anti suicide discourse.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** Yes, ""kill myself.""
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** Yes, very clearly: ""the day i chose is very soon,"" ""I'm not cut out for life and I can't even imagine mine being worth living.""
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No, the writer explicitly states the opposite, indicating a clear intention to act and a rejection of being ""talked down.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied?** No specific method is mentioned.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes. The contemplation of making final calls/contacts (""calling my grandparents,"" ""telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother"") and the internal debate about the impact of these actions (""don't want them to think the phone call was me trying to be talked down,"" ""not sure if that would like, haunt people more or something"") are strong indicators of *preparatory thoughts* for an imminent suicidal act. The phrase ""the day i chose is very soon"" also implies a timeline for a planned action.
    *   **Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context.** The high imminence (""very soon"") combined with the detailed consideration of *final goodbyes/contacts* pushes this beyond mere ideation. These are not just thoughts about dying, but thoughts about *actions to take in preparation for dying*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both?** It describes a current/future intention (""the day i chose is very soon""). While the desire has existed for ""over a decade,"" the active planning/preparation is current and imminent.
    *   **Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past?** No, it does not describe a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses explicit personal suicidal intent and a desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""not cut out for life,"" ""day i chose is very soon""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by discussing *preparatory actions* related to saying goodbyes or making final contacts (""calling my grandparents,"" ""telling friends I love them,"" ""hugging my brother"") and contemplating the impact of these actions. This, combined with the high imminence (""very soon""), fits the definition of 'Behavior', which includes ""preparations being taken"" or an ""intended action element."" While no specific *method* is stated, the detailed consideration of pre-suicidal actions is sufficient for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent, high imminence, and the detailed consideration of preparatory actions (making final contacts/goodbyes), the most appropriate classification is 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months."" ""Want to be out of my misery"" implies a desire for life to end or to no longer exist in a state of suffering.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""feel like abandoning everyone,"" ""pain for over 5 years,"" ""just cba anymore"" (can't be bothered anymore), ""misery."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and fatigue.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquiring means. ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" indicates withdrawal, but not a direct preparation for a suicidal act.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" refers to a past *state* of suicidality, not a past *action* or attempt. ""pain for over 5 years"" refers to chronic emotional pain, not an action.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The current state is described as ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months,"" suggesting a high level of current ideation. The desire ""just want to be out of my misery"" is present and strong.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to end suffering, which, coupled with the explicit mention of being ""suicidal,"" indicates a genuine wish for life to end. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""most suicidal I've been.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" strongly implies a desire for life to end to escape suffering.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the thoughts are presented as the writer's current, very strong state.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" indicates withdrawal, which can be a symptom of suicidality, but it is not a direct preparation for a suicidal *act* (like acquiring means or writing a note).
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While the intent is high, there is no vague reference to *action* or *method*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of intense suicidal ideation and desire (""most suicidal I've been,"" ""want to be out of my misery"") and a future intention of withdrawal (""Not going to contact anyone"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. ""most suicidal I've been"" refers to a state of mind, not a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to end suffering (""most suicidal I've been,"" ""want to be out of my misery""). This rules out 'Indicator' as it's not abstract distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for a suicidal act. The withdrawal (""Not going to contact anyone"") is a general behavioral change, not a specific preparation for a method. This means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The post explicitly states ""I just want to die"" and ""I just want to kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, frustration (""Why is it so hard to die"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""but I can't find a suitable way to go,"" indicating a *lack* of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of intentions: The desire is current (""I just want to..."").
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and genuine wish to die and to kill oneself. The thoughts are not stated as unwanted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just want to die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to act but is struggling to find a method.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No. The phrase ""I can't find a suitable way to go"" explicitly indicates the *absence* of a identified method or plan.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: While intent and imminence are high, the explicit statement about *not being able to find a way* negates the presence of even a vague plan or method. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die and suicidal intent (""I just want to die,"" ""I just want to kill myself""). The thoughts are not presented as unwanted.
    - 'Ideation' fits perfectly. The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive. Crucially, it explicitly states the *absence* of any specific plan, method, or preparations (""I can't find a suitable way to go"").
    - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. The post explicitly states the difficulty in finding a way, which means no method has been identified or chosen.
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated suicidal action.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal ideation without a specific plan or method.

    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: None.
    - Emotional indicators: ""low point,"" ""shitty grammar"" (self-deprecating), ""zero social skills,"" ""low self esteem,"" ""lonely,"" ""worried."" These indicate general distress, low mood, and anxiety.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None related to suicide or self-harm.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: No suicidal intentions are stated. The stated intention is to seek advice for ""better living.""
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: The writer is asking for ""ADVICE"" on whether moving to another country is ""worth"" it for ""better living."" The desire is to improve their life, not end it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The post is about seeking advice to improve their current living situation and skills.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings (""Im in the low point"") and future considerations/questions about moving and developing skills.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses general distress, low self-esteem, loneliness, and being at a ""low point."" However, it explicitly asks for ""ADVICE"" on how to achieve ""better living"" by potentially moving to another country and developing a second language. There is no mention of suicide, self-harm, a desire to die, or any suicidal ideation. The focus is on seeking solutions and improving life, despite current struggles.
    - This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" In this case, there's no mention of suicide at all, only general distress and a plea for advice to improve their situation.

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP"". This is a death wish directed at another person, not the author.
    - Emotional indicators: Extreme anger, hatred, desire for harm towards another individual.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to the author's own potential self-harm or suicide.
    - References to past actions: ""reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned"" - this refers to an action taken by another person, not a past suicidal action by the author.
    - Imminence: ""ASAP"" refers to the desired death of the *other person*.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer expresses a desire for *someone else* to die, not themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., ""I want to be gone,"" ""I want it to be over,"" ""I hate living,"" ""life isn't worth it,"" ""I'm going to die soon"" in a context of despair)? No. The desire for death is directed at another person.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are mentioned by the author for themselves.
    - **Crucial Rule Check:** The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned. Based on this, there is no personal suicidal intent from the author.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act *by the author*? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation *by the author*? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a past event (account ban) and a current wish for harm towards another person.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated *by the author* in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses intense anger and a death wish directed at another person. It contains no indication of the author's own suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, or past attempts.
    - 'Attempt' is incorrect as there is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action by the author.
    - 'Behavior' is incorrect as there is no mention of a plan, method, or intended action for suicide by the author.
    - 'Ideation' is incorrect as there is no explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire for the author to die.
    - 'Indicator' is defined as a post that ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author."" This post fits that primary criterion perfectly. While the post expresses anger rather than general distress/sadness/hopelessness directly about the author's own state, it definitively lacks any personal suicidal intent. Given the strict requirement to choose one of the four categories and the explicit rule that risk only applies to the author, 'Indicator' is the only fitting category as it represents the absence of direct personal suicidal intent or action.

I have a problem, this women is bullying me and other people with her for couple of years now. I will kill her. I tried every possible thing to make her stop, but she is the most jealous person I have ever met in my life, so I will kill her, to finally live my life in peace. Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post repeatedly mentions ""kill my bullie,"" ""kill her,"" and ""murder her."" It also contains an abstract statement: ""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others."" However, the core intent expressed by the author is directed outwards, towards the bully. There is no mention of the author killing themselves or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme anger, frustration, and a desire for peace, to be achieved through homicide.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The author asks for ""any suggestion of how to murder her,"" indicating a search for a method/plan for homicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I tried every possible thing to make her stop"" refers to past attempts to resolve the bullying, not past self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I will kill her"" indicates a strong, current intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer's desire is to kill the bully to ""finally live my life in peace."" The desire for death is explicitly directed at another person, not the author themselves.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, the explicit intent is to kill *another person*.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The author wants to live their life in peace *after* killing the bully.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? N/A, as personal suicidal thoughts are not expressed.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The request for ""suggestion of how to murder her"" relates to a homicidal act, not a suicidal one.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention to kill the bully.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, it describes a future intended action against another person.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The crucial rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   The post expresses clear homicidal intent and ideation, but *no* suicidal intent or ideation on the part of the author.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no mention of a past self-initiated suicidal action.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out as there is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to die, nor any plan/method for *self-harm*.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out as there are no explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire for the author's own life to end. The desire for death is directed outwards.
    *   **Indicator:** This category is defined as expressing general distress or discussing suicide abstractly, but **lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.** This post fits this definition because, despite the extreme distress and violent intent, it *lacks any personal suicidal intent* from the author. The abstract mention of ""type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others"" is not a personal expression of suicidal desire. The primary intent is homicidal, not suicidal. Therefore, in the context of *suicide risk classification*, the author does not demonstrate personal suicidal risk based on the provided categories.

438,I'm on the verge of suicide. 19F I seriously cannot do this anymore. My mental health really bad and the stress of college is making. Honestly the stress might kill me before I even kill myself. I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""cannot do this anymore,"" ""mental health really bad,"" ""stress,"" ""disappointment and failure.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I know exactly what to do"" is a direct statement indicating the presence of a plan or method, even if not explicitly detailed.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""on the verge of suicide,"" ""cannot do this anymore"" suggests high imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die/end life (""I seriously cannot do this anymore,"" ""I just want to end it all"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes (""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all"").
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes (""I just want to end it all"").
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the opposite; the writer expresses a desire to act on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" strongly implies the existence of a specific plan or method, even if the details are withheld. It's not just a thought; it's a statement of knowing *how* to act.
    - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but ""I know exactly what to do"" suggests a level of readiness or contemplation beyond mere ideation.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: Yes, the strong desire to end it all (""on the verge,"" ""cannot do this anymore"") combined with the explicit statement of knowing ""exactly what to do"" indicates a plan or intended action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""on the verge,"" ""want to end it all,"" ""know exactly what to do"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and desire to die (""verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to end it all""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere ideation by stating ""I know exactly what to do."" This phrase indicates the presence of a plan or method in the author's mind, even if not explicitly detailed in the post. This moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    - The combination of strong suicidal intent, high imminence, and the explicit statement of having a known plan (""I know exactly what to do"") aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Key elements: ""Someone kill me,"" ""I just wanna die.""
    - Mentions of death/dying: Explicitly states ""kill me"" and ""wanna die.""
    - Emotional indicators: Clear despair, desire for life to end.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned. The phrase ""Someone kill me"" is a plea, not a self-initiated plan or method.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Expresses a current desire, but no specific timeframe for action by the author.
    - Writer's stated desire: A genuine and explicit wish to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I just wanna die"" and ""Someone kill me"" clearly express a personal desire for death.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just wanna die"" is a direct statement of this.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is presented as personal and current.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. No action by the author is implied beyond the desire to die. ""Someone kill me"" is a plea for external action, not an internal plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I just wanna die,"" ""Someone kill me""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's more than general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a direct expression of wanting to die.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations being taken by the author. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or intended action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None. The user expresses being ""tired of being unhappy,"" ""lost and alone,"" and ""tired of being depressed,"" but does not mention death or suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of being unhappy,"" ""lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed,"" ""always rejected,"" ""unhappy life."" These indicate significant emotional distress, despair, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None. The user is asking for divine intervention to change their life circumstances.
    *   **References to past actions (initiated but not completed):** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** No suicidal intentions are stated. The pleas are for a change in their current state.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses a profound desire for their current struggles (being gay, gender dysphoria, depression) to end and for them to be ""normal."" They want ""all thoughts away,"" ""all gayness away,"" ""all gender dysphoria away,"" ""all depression everything negative out my life."" This is a desire for an end to suffering, not an end to life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. While the user is ""tired of being unhappy"" and ""tired of being depressed,"" this is expressed as a desire for their *circumstances* to change or for their suffering to *end*, not for their *life* to end. They are asking God to ""make me normal,"" ""take all thoughts away,"" ""do a miracle."" This indicates a desire to live differently, not to die.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** No suicidal thoughts are mentioned. The thoughts they want taken away are ""gayness,"" ""gender dysphoria,"" and ""depression.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied for a suicidal act.
    *   No signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current and long-standing distress (""26 always had unhappy life"") and a plea for future change.
    *   It does not describe any past, current, or future specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and a desire for an end to suffering. However, it *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author*. The user is asking for a change in their life circumstances and for negative feelings/conditions to be removed, not for their life to end. There are no explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts mentioned.
    *   This fits the definition of 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress and hopelessness but *lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent*. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit desire to die or end life, nor direct suicidal thoughts. It certainly does not meet 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly uses the word ""suicidal"" in the question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"". This is a direct reference to suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness (""no change in sight""), and chronic pain (""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts""). The question implies the pain is severe enough to lead to suicidal thoughts, suggesting a personal connection to such feelings.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated, but the question implies a current struggle where suicidal thoughts are a direct consequence of ongoing pain.
    - Writer's stated desire: The phrasing ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" strongly suggests the writer is experiencing or contemplating suicidal thoughts due to their own knee pain, and is seeking others who can relate. It's not a general query about suicide, but one linked to their specific, personal suffering. There is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While not a direct ""I want to die"" statement, the question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" in the context of chronic, unyielding pain strongly implies the writer is experiencing or considering suicidal thoughts as a direct result of their personal suffering. It's an indirect but clear expression of personal suicidal ideation.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, there is no negation.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current, ongoing struggle (""It's been 8 months, with no change in sight"") that is leading to suicidal thoughts.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post directly uses the term ""suicidal"" in relation to the author's personal experience of chronic pain. This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide, making it more than 'Indicator'. The phrasing ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" implies the writer is experiencing or considering such thoughts themselves due to their pain, and is seeking validation or shared experience, rather than explicitly stating the thoughts are unwanted.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses or strongly implies personal suicidal thoughts or feelings linked to the author's current suffering, without a concrete plan or action.

My substance abuse is rooted in the need to be loved. Does anyone else feel this way? I'm married and I feel alone in my own head. I wish my partner would care about me the way I do about them. I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need. The damage that caused me has been irreparable. Fuck polyamory and open relationships too. I hate now this is normalized now. Not only do I feel distant from my friends, family and everything else around me but also my lover who's supposed to guide me through this pain and make me feel right. After covid, all the other shite that's happened this year too. I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""I don't think I can go on much longer."" (Implies ending life)
        *   ""I'm over life."" (Clear desire for life to end)
        *   ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" (Suggests a final task/preparation before life ends)
        *   ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"" (Explicit desire for death)
        *   ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again."" (Mentions suicide of another, finds comfort in potentially joining them)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""destroyed me mentally,"" ""pain,"" ""nothingness of no purpose,"" ""alone,"" ""abandoned,"" ""ruined me,"" ""irreparable,"" ""distant,"" ""guilty."" High levels of hopelessness, despair, loneliness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This is a strong indication of a preparatory step or a pre-condition before the intended end. It's not a method, but a preparation.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions another person's suicide, but no past suicide attempts by the author.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""its finally over"" (after making the record). This indicates a current and near-future intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die and for life to end. Not expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; rather, ""looking forward to"" death.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No direct phrase, but the combination of ""I'm over life,"" ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" and ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"" constitutes clear and explicit suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""I'm over life,"" ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses a desire to act on them and looks forward to death.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific *method* (like pills, gun, bridge) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This indicates a specific, self-imposed task or pre-condition that the author intends to complete *before* ending their life. This functions as a preparation or a final step leading to the intended action. It's a concrete action the author plans to take *before* the end.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The imminence is high. The ""one last record"" is a specific, actionable item the author intends to complete before the end. This is a strong indicator of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Primarily current feelings and future intention related to ending life (""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""One last record for me to make and its finally over,"" ""I am looking forward to..."").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. It mentions another person's suicide, but not the author's own past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and for life to end (""I'm over life,"" ""I am looking forward to... death""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by mentioning a specific preparatory step: ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This implies a concrete action the author intends to take *before* the suicidal act. This moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'. While a specific method isn't named, the *preparation* for the final act is.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the presence of clear suicidal intent combined with a stated preparatory action (""One last record..."") classifies this as 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""I want to die"" is explicitly stated.
    - Emotional indicators: Anger, resentment, desire for revenge (""make my mom feel pain,"" ""she belittles me""). Hopelessness/despair is implied by the desire to die.

    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). It's a current desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear, genuine wish to die is expressed (""I want to die""). It is not presented as an unwanted thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, ""I want to die"" expresses a clear desire to die.
    - The writer does not state they do not want these thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied for carrying out the suicidal act. The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is"" is too vague to constitute a plan or method; it refers to the consequence/location of the *death*, not the *means* of achieving it.
    - No signs of preparation.
    - Imminence is not high enough to infer a vague method from a general statement of intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current desire/intention.
    - It does not describe a past, specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""I want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'. The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is"" refers to the *consequence* or *location* of the death, not the *method* of dying.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/desire to die without any specific plan, method, or preparation.

I can't be good at fighting games. I can't be good at racing games. I can't be good at art. I can't be good at anything because I'm truly useless, all I'm useful for is being a errand boy. I can't even be a good boy because I'm trans. I can't do anything right. I've started to try and starve myself, at least that method is slower and won't be as painful as hanging myself, I'd prefer having access to a gun though, at least that would be quicker, painless, and more deadly. I'd have a better place in heaven, at least I'll be able to see my dad again. All the help I could get doesn't even want to talk to me anymore. I'm a nuisance. I can't do anything right I'm so useless, if I keep starving myself I'll at least be dead by the end of the week. I just want my death to come faster",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods/means:** ""starve myself"" (initiated method), ""hanging myself"" (considered method), ""access to a gun"" (preferred method), ""dead by the end of the week"" (desired outcome/timeframe), ""just want my death to come faster"" (explicit desire for death).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""lost everything important,"" ""drive my friends away,"" ""can't do anything right,"" ""useless,"" ""nuisance."" (Strong feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, burden, despair).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states, ""I've started to try and starve myself."" This is a concrete, initiated action. It also discusses other methods (hanging, gun) and a timeframe for the initiated action (""dead by the end of the week"").
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I've started to try and starve myself"" indicates an *initiated* and *ongoing* action.
    *   **Imminence:** ""by the end of the week,"" ""death to come faster."" High imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and strong desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post does not explicitly use ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it clearly expresses a desire to die (""just want my death to come faster,"" ""dead by the end of the week"") and is actively engaging in a method to achieve this.
    *   The writer is not expressing unwanted thoughts; they are expressing a clear desire to die and are acting on it.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Specific methods are mentioned: ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""gun.""
    *   Crucially, there is an *initiated action*: ""I've started to try and starve myself."" This is more than just a plan or preparation; it's the beginning of the act itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a *current, ongoing, self-initiated action* (""I've started to try and starve myself"") with a future, imminent desired outcome (""dead by the end of the week"").
    *   The phrase ""I've started to try and starve myself"" directly indicates a *specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author*. While starvation is a slow method, the *initiation* of it with the intent to die qualifies as an initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to clear personal suicidal intent and initiated action.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is not only clear ideation but also specific methods and an initiated action.
    *   **Behavior:** While there are plans/methods mentioned, the key differentiator here is the phrase ""I've started to try and starve myself."" This signifies an *initiated action* rather than just planning or preparing. Behavior focuses on plans, methods, or preparations *before* the action is initiated.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal."" ""I've started to try and starve myself"" fits this definition perfectly. It describes an action that has been initiated by the author with the intent to die, making it a self-initiated potentially lethal act, even if it's ongoing and slow. The imminence (""by the end of the week"") further underscores the seriousness of this initiated action.

The presence of an *initiated action* (""I've started to try and starve myself"") with suicidal intent makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate classification, as it describes a concrete step taken towards ending one's life.

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up.

    *   It does *not* describe a past specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author. ""My life has already been over for six years now"" is a feeling, not an action.

    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by explicitly mentioning specific plans, methods (""pistol,"" ""gasoline and light up""), and preparations (""escape bag,"" ""plan my suicide every single day""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   There is no description of a *past initiated suicidal action* by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** Very high. ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" indicates a very recent, initiated action. ""Today I failed"" refers to this immediate past action. ""then do it"" indicates immediate future intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die and end life, frustrated by inability to complete.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and a clear desire to die and end life (""I can't go on like this,"" ""I just can't pull myself together and just do it"").
    *   The writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions; rather, they express frustration at *failing* to act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, for current actions: ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" is a specific method (hanging) and a clear initiated action/preparation.
    *   Yes, for past actions: ""cut my wrists,"" ""laid on a road,"" ""jumped in front of a train"" are specific methods/actions.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past events and a very recent/current initiated action, as well as a current/future intention.
    *   It describes multiple *specific, potentially lethal actions* that were *initiated* by the author in the past (""tried to cut my wrists,"" ""laid on a road,"" ""jumped in front of a train"").
    *   It also describes a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was *initiated* by the author very recently/currently: ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck."" This is an initiated action, even if it was stopped by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation and desire to die.
    *   It describes a very recent, specific, self-initiated action (""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"") which falls under the definition of 'Attempt' as it was a potentially lethal action initiated by the author, even if interrupted.
    *   Crucially, it also describes multiple clear past suicide attempts (""tried to cut my wrists,"" ""laid on a road,"" ""jumped in front of a train""). The definition of 'Attempt' explicitly includes ""attempts described as historical (e.g., 'many years ago') if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" The author clearly links these past attempts to their current state of being ""suicidal all my life"" and ""everytime I try I fail.""
    *   Given the presence of both very recent and multiple historical, clearly described initiated suicidal actions, 'Attempt' is the most accurate classification. While there is also current ideation and a plan, the 'Attempt' category takes precedence due to the described initiated actions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?"", ""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" ""die at 50 or earlier,"" ""not worth pushing my life further.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Apathy towards life, resignation, hopelessness (""future is really grim"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states, ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it."" However, it mentions a passive action: ""I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come."" This is a form of passive neglect of health, accepting death rather than actively pursuing it. It's not a direct *plan* to commit suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** None related to suicidal acts.
    *   **Imminence:** The passive acceptance is current. The denial of active plans suggests no immediate active intent.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for life to end or not to be prolonged (""if I die then I die,"" ""not worth pushing my life further""). This is not an unwanted thought; it's an accepted state.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? It asks ""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?"" which introduces the concept of suicide, but doesn't state ""I want to kill myself.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" ""not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be."" This indicates a profound desire for life to end or not to be preserved.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses acceptance of death and a lack of desire to prolong life. The statement ""I don't have any plans to end it"" refers to *active* plans, not the underlying desire for life to end.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The action mentioned (""stopped visiting the doctor's"") is a passive form of self-neglect, not an active method of suicide like taking pills or jumping.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Stopping doctor visits is a form of passive preparation for death, but it's not a direct preparation for *committing* suicide via a specific method. The post explicitly denies ""any plans to end it."" The definition of 'Behavior' requires a ""plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action... or preparations being taken."" While stopping doctor visits is a concerning action, it doesn't fit the examples or the direct intent of *committing* suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of mind and a current passive action (""stopped visiting the doctor's"") and a future acceptance (""willing to accept when my time has come"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire for life to end or not to be prolonged (""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" ""not worth pushing my life further""). This goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts, making it more than 'Indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly states, ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it."" While stopping doctor visits is a concerning passive action, it is not an active *plan to commit suicide* with a specific method or intended action as required for 'Behavior'. The denial of active plans is crucial here. The desire for death is present, but the active plan/method is absent.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it's not 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the presence of a clear desire for life to end, coupled with the explicit denial of active plans, fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""hate myself,"" ""too depressed,"" ""too ugly,"" ""too lazy,"" ""thyroid is too fucked up."" These indicate self-loathing, hopelessness, and low self-worth.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" explicitly states a *lack* of intent or ability to act on the suicidal thought. ""unless I starve myself or something"" is a hypothetical for weight loss, not a suicidal method.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not applicable, as the post states a *lack* of intention to act.
    - Stated desire: The writer expresses suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") but immediately qualifies it with ""too much of a coward to kill myself,"" indicating a lack of current intent to act on that thought. The primary sentiment is self-hatred and despair, with the suicidal thought presented as something they feel they *can't* do.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While the thought ""kill myself"" is present, the immediate follow-up ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" negates a clear, current *desire to act* on that thought. It expresses the *presence* of the thought but also the *inability* or *unwillingness* to pursue it.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" strongly implies they do not intend to act on it, effectively negating the immediate personal desire to die by suicide. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition where thoughts are present but not representing a current personal desire to die.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current feelings and thoughts.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains the phrase ""kill myself,"" indicating suicidal ideation. However, the critical qualifier ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" explicitly states that the author does not intend to act on this thought.
    - This fits the definition of 'Indicator': ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die** (e.g., 'my brain tells me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to die')."" The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" functions similarly, indicating that despite the thought, there is no current personal desire or intent to carry out the act.
    - It is not 'Ideation' because 'Ideation' implies a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. Here, that intent is explicitly negated by the ""coward"" statement.
    - It is not 'Behavior' as there is no plan, method, or preparation.
    - It is not 'Attempt' as there is no mention of a past initiated action.
    - Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate classification due to the explicit negation of intent to act on the suicidal thought.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   The post discusses how to help a ""friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide.""
    *   It offers advice like ""hugs"" and ""support"" instead of ""finding a solution"" or ""questions, not advice.""
    *   Key elements: Discussion of suicide, but explicitly in the context of *helping a friend*, not the author's personal experience.
    *   No mentions of death, dying, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions *by the author*.
    *   No emotional indicators of the author's personal distress or suicidal ideation.

    *   The post is general advice for helping someone in the present.
    *   No past, current, or future specific, potentially lethal actions are described *by the author*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly discusses suicide, but it's in the context of providing guidance on how to support *others* who are experiencing suicidal thoughts.
    *   The crucial rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   Since the author is not expressing personal suicidal intent, desire, a plan, or a past attempt, but rather discussing the topic abstractly or in relation to others, it falls under 'Indicator'. It discusses suicide abstractly and lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.

I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""no reason to live"" - expresses hopelessness and lack of purpose.
        *   ""I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that."" - Direct mention of suicide, personal identification, and acceptance.
        *   ""will only drive me further to killing myself."" - Direct mention of killing self.
        *   ""it's time to die."" - Direct expression of desire to die.
        *   No specific methods, tools, or locations for suicide are mentioned. The Ativan mention is about taking a last dose of a prescribed medication for anxiety, not as a suicide method. The drinking is self-medication.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""no reason to live,"" ""waste of life""), despair, isolation (""no one anymore,"" ""no one""), feeling like a burden/deserving pain (""bad karma,"" ""deserve this"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None explicitly stated for a suicidal act. The Ativan is a coping mechanism, not a suicide method here.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""I took my last Ativan today"" - a recent action, but not a suicidal one. No past suicide attempts are mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""it just seems like the end to me,"" ""I am finally becoming content with that,"" ""will only drive me further to killing myself,"" ""it's time to die."" These indicate a current, deepening, and accepted suicidal desire, suggesting high imminence of the *ideation*.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire to die and acceptance of suicide (""content with that,"" ""killing myself,"" ""it's time to die""). This is not about unwanted thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes (""suicide,"" ""killing myself"").
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes (""no reason to live,"" ""it's time to die,"" ""content with that [suicide is life's purpose]"").
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses *contentment* with the idea of suicide and feels ""it's time to die.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The mention of Ativan is about its *absence* as a coping mechanism, not its use as a suicide method. No other methods (e.g., pills, gun, bridge) are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No (e.g., no mention of writing notes, giving things away).
    *   While intent and imminence of the *desire* are high, there is no specific action or method mentioned, even vaguely, that would push it to 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings, a deepening acceptance of suicide, and a future trajectory (""will only drive me further to killing myself"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. No past suicide attempts are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear, explicit, and personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that,"" ""killing myself,"" ""it's time to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for suicide. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. While the desire is strong and accepted, the *how* is completely absent.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits the definition of 'Ideation' due to the explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without any mentioned plan, method, or preparation.

451,"Is drowning yourself painful?. As the title says. I think its the best option for me, its basically a guaranteed death is it not? Sounds rather peaceful actually, slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean as you see a light at the end of the tunnel. A nice smooth transition to death. If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""Drowning yourself,"" ""guaranteed death,"" ""transition to death,"" ""go and do that.""
    - Emotional indicators: The post expresses a clear preference for a specific method of death, implying a state of despair or hopelessness where death is seen as the ""best option.""
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific method (""drowning yourself,"" ""sinking to the bottom of the ocean"") is discussed in detail. An intended action is stated, conditional on a trigger (""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that""). No explicit preparations (like notes, acquiring means) are mentioned, but the discussion of a specific method and conditional intent points towards a plan.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Conditional imminence (""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that""). This is a future intention tied to a specific life event.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear desire to die and for life to end, seeing drowning as the ""best option"" and a ""nice smooth transition to death.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? While ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used, ""drowning yourself"" is a direct description of a suicidal act.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""I think its the best option for me, its basically a guaranteed death is it not? Sounds rather peaceful actually, slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean... A nice smooth transition to death."" This clearly indicates a desire for death.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the thoughts are embraced as a preferred option.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""drowning yourself"" and ""sinking to the bottom of the ocean"" are specific methods/locations.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations, but the discussion of a specific method and the conditional intention to ""go and do that"" indicates a planned action.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The method (""drowning"") is specific, not vague, and the intent to ""go and do that"" is a clear intended action, albeit conditional.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Future intention, conditional on a specific event (""If I get kicked out of my house"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is clear, personal, and explicit suicidal intent and desire for death, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is strong ideation (desire to die, thoughts of suicide), the post goes beyond mere thoughts by discussing a specific method (""drowning yourself,"" ""sinking to the bottom of the ocean"") and a conditional intended action (""I think I might go and do that"").
    - **Behavior:** This fits. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a specific method (""drowning yourself,"" ""sinking to the bottom of the ocean"") and an intended action (""go and do that""), even if conditional. The presence of a specific method and an intention to act on it, even if conditional, classifies it as Behavior.
    - **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past initiated action is described.

The post clearly expresses a desire to die and outlines a specific method and a conditional plan to carry out that method. This aligns with the definition of Behavior.

452,"Is life actually worth living anymore?. We've been in this pandemic for a year now and very little, if anything, seems to have improved. I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate? How can people justify living like this? We've been patient, we have persevered we have sacrificed so much and it has all been for nothing. Surely, I can just call it quits now?. Death seems a better option to me than living in this world. I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'. I can hardly function anymore. I can barely sleep without waking up in the middle of the night for no obvious reason. I think it's time for me to accept defeat.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly asks ""Is life actually worth living anymore?"", ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"", ""I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out."", ""I don't see what there is to live for."", ""Surely, I can just call it quits now?"", and ""Death seems a better option to me than living in this world."" These are direct or strong indirect mentions of suicide and a desire for death. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""very little...seems to have improved,"" ""all been for nothing,"" ""virus has won,"" ""I don't see what there is to live for""), despair (""mental beating,"" ""excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world,"" ""collapsing world""), anhedonia (""I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'""), inability to cope (""I don't know if I can take it anymore,"" ""test the limits of my resilience,"" ""hardly function anymore,"" ""accept defeat"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None. No tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquiring means are mentioned or implied.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** Phrases like ""now?"", ""at this rate?"", ""call it quits now?"", ""time for me to accept defeat"" suggest a current, active consideration but not a concrete, imminent *action* with a plan.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear and strong desire for life to end, or for the writer to ""get out"" of their current existence. The writer questions if suicide is ""appropriate now"" and states a preference for death over living.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"").
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die/not be alive (""I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out,"" ""I don't see what there is to live for,"" ""Death seems a better option to me than living in this world"").
    *   No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they are presented as a serious consideration and a preferred option.
    *   **Conclusion:** This clearly indicates strong suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied.
    *   No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   While imminence is present in the questioning, there is no vague reference to an *action* that implies a method. Phrases like ""call it quits now?"" or ""accept defeat"" are expressions of giving up, not an intended action with a method.
    *   **Conclusion:** No plan, method, or preparation is identified.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a current consideration of ending life.
    *   It does not describe any past or very recent specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.
    *   **Conclusion:** No past or current initiated action is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I don't want to live,"" ""Death seems a better option,"" ""suicide is appropriate now?""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not present suicidal thoughts as unwanted or abstract; therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   It lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out suicide; therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe any past or very recent initiated suicidal action; therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The strong, clear desire to end life and explicit mention of suicide, without any specific plan or past action, places this firmly in 'Ideation'.

I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post explicitly mentions ""not to kill myself"" and ""postpone any suicide attempts.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author expresses finding a ""reason not to"" act on suicidal thoughts, implying that suicidal ideation was present and serious enough to consider ""attempts."" The ""lol"" at the end might indicate a coping mechanism or an attempt to lighten the mood, but doesn't negate the underlying seriousness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation for a current or future suicidal act is mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" implies that suicide attempts are a recurring consideration or a part of the author's history, but it does not describe a *specific, initiated past action*.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The stated intention is to *postpone* any suicidal actions, indicating a lack of immediate intent to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer states a reason *not* to kill themselves, implying a desire to live *for now*, but also acknowledging the presence of suicidal thoughts/tendencies (""suicide attempts"") that need to be postponed.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts.""
    *   The post expresses an underlying desire to die or for life to end (implied by the need to find a reason *not* to act), but this desire is currently being *postponed*.
    *   The writer is not explicitly stating they *do not* want these thoughts, but rather that they have found a reason to *postpone* acting on them. This suggests the thoughts/desire are present and serious.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned for a current or future act. The intent is to *postpone* action, not to plan or prepare for it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current situation where the author is finding a reason to *postpone* potential future actions (""suicide attempts"").
    *   It does *not* describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was *initiated* by the author in the past (e.g., ""I took pills last night""). While ""suicide attempts"" is mentioned, it's in a general sense of something to be postponed, not a detailed account of a past initiated action. The plural ""attempts"" suggests a history or recurring consideration, but without specific details of an *initiated action*, it doesn't fit the strict definition of 'Attempt' as a described past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Too weak. The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" which goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Behavior:** No specific plan, method, or intended action for a *current or future* act is described. The key is the *postponement*, not the initiation of a plan.
    *   **Attempt:** While ""suicide attempts"" is mentioned, the post does not describe a *specific, initiated past action* by the author. The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" refers to future potential actions or a general tendency, not a concrete past event as required by the 'Attempt' definition (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to hang myself"").
    *   **Ideation:** The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") and acknowledges the severity of these thoughts by referring to ""suicide attempts"" as a real possibility for the author. However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for carrying out an act *currently*, nor is a specific past initiated action described. The core of the post is the presence of suicidal thoughts/desire that are currently being managed by finding a reason to *postpone* action. This fits the definition of Ideation, which includes ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive any longer... without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned for carrying it out."" The reference to ""attempts"" indicates the severity of the ideation, but not a concrete plan or past initiated action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The phrases ""no will to live anymore"" and ""I just want to end it all"" clearly indicate a desire for death/suicide. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired and beaten,"" ""can't take it anymore,"" ""feeling even worse,"" ""so tired of living like this,"" ""worthless loser,"" ""nothing to contribute."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, and feelings of worthlessness/being a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""I just want to end it all"" expresses a current, strong desire, but there's no specific temporal marker (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") indicating immediate action.
    *   **Assess the writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, genuine wish for life to end and a desire to die (""no will to live anymore,"" ""I just want to end it all""). The thoughts are not stated as unwanted.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it all"" is a very strong and direct phrase implying suicide.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""no will to live anymore,"" ""I just want to end it all,"" ""so tired of living like this.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly personal and not negated.
    *   **Conclusion:** There is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator' as the primary classification.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While desire is high, there is no reference to *how* the pain will be made physical or any other vague action. The imminence is for the *desire* to end it all, not for a specific *action*.
    *   **Conclusion:** No plan, method, or preparation is identified. This rules out 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of mind and a current desire/intention (""I have absolutely no will to live anymore,"" ""I just want to end it all"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.
    *   **Conclusion:** No past initiated action is described. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die and wanting life to end (""no will to live anymore,"" ""I just want to end it all""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not merely express general distress or unwanted thoughts; the desire to die is clearly the author's own. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations, which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal act, which distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""I'm going to kill myself."" No specific method or means is mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: Extreme self-deprecation (""disappointment,"" ""no fucking talent,"" ""useless bitch,"" ""failing miserably,"" ""ideas are just shit,"" ""delusional,"" ""cunt,"" ""no value,"" ""fuck hole,"" ""worst of all human beings""), despair, and self-loathing are prominent.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""I'm going to kill myself"" indicates a current/future intention, but no specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""now"" is given.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear and explicit desire to die or end life, expressed as ""I'm going to kill myself.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:

    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself"" is a direct expression of this desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement is a direct expression of intent, not a description of unwanted thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While ""I'm going to kill myself"" shows intent, there is no vague reference to *how* or *what* action would be taken, beyond the general statement of intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention (""I'm going to kill myself"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, explicit, personal expression of suicidal intent (""I'm going to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator' as it's not general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a direct statement of desire/intent.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations for carrying out the suicidal act. This rules out 'Behavior'. The statement ""I'm going to kill myself"" is an intent, but lacks the ""how"" or ""what"" of a plan or action.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' because it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.

457,My landlord called for the smell of a Dead Body. My landlord is clearly trying to get me out of my apartment. My neighbors have been purposely keeping me awake. I've probably slept an hour every night for I dont even know how many nights anymore. The landlord had one of em call or the landlord himself called and reported the dead body smell. No smell was found by the cops. I'm so tired. My heads messing with me. I just wanna leave this place. I got diagnosed with MS recently it's hard to deal. I just know I'm gonna be wakened if I fall asleep. It never fails. I cant take this torture from these people. I want to leave. I have no money to just walk out or i would. I dont know what options I have left. I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** The post mentions ""smell of a Dead Body,"" but this is attributed to the landlord's false report, not the author's intent or state. There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means related to the author.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm so tired,"" ""My heads messing with me,"" ""it's hard to deal,"" ""I cant take this torture,"" ""I dont know what options I have left,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs."" These indicate extreme exhaustion, paranoia, hopelessness, feeling trapped, and profound suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None. The stated desire is to ""leave this place"" or ""walk out,"" not to die.
    *   **References to past actions:** None related to suicide or self-harm.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** The intentions are to ""leave this place"" or ""walk out,"" which are desires to escape the situation, not to end life.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer explicitly states ""I just wanna leave this place,"" and ""I want to leave."" They express distress about their living situation and perceived torture, not a desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The desire is to ""leave this place"" or ""walk out."" While the author expresses profound suffering and hopelessness about their situation (""this is hell,"" ""just here to suffer""), they do not state a personal desire for death or for their life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. This is not applicable as there is no explicit desire to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current distress and a desire to escape the current living situation.
    *   Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post conveys significant distress, mental anguish, paranoia, exhaustion, and a feeling of being trapped and tortured. It hints at severe mental health struggles (""My heads messing with me,"" ""this is hell and everyone is in on it but me"").
    *   However, critically, the post **lacks any personal expression of suicidal intent or a desire to die.** The author's stated desire is to ""leave this place"" or ""walk out,"" to escape the perceived torture. While the level of distress is very high, it is directed at the external situation and the desire for escape from it, rather than an internal desire for life to end.
    *   There are no mentions of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts.
    *   Therefore, it falls under 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and potential mental health issues, but not a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""Possible suicide date is in July."" This is a direct mention of suicide and a specific timeframe.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My parents don't love me,"" ""I have nobody :),"" ""Too bad I'm fucking debating it because of my friends,"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope',"" ""I don't even know who I am anymore if I'm being honest."" These indicate profound distress, hopelessness, isolation, self-loathing, and identity confusion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""Possible suicide date is in July."" This indicates a specific temporal element of a plan.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""in July."" This is a future, specific timeframe, not immediate but clearly considered. The phrase ""debating it"" implies active consideration of the action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""Possible suicide date is in July"" clearly indicates a personal consideration of suicide. The debate is about *whether* to act on this, not whether the suicidal thoughts are unwanted.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""Possible suicide date is in July.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the mention of a ""suicide date"" in the context of deep despair indicates a clear personal intent to end life.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No. The writer is ""debating it because of my friends,"" which means they are weighing external factors against the internal desire/plan, not that the desire itself is unwanted.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method or location.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations like notes or acquiring means.
    *   However, the post mentions a ""possible suicide date."" This is a specific temporal element of a ""plan to commit suicide."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide."" Setting a specific date, even if tentative, moves beyond mere ideation into the realm of planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a future intention (""in July"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and desire (""Possible suicide date is in July""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts by mentioning a specific ""possible suicide date."" This constitutes a concrete element of a ""plan to commit suicide,"" even without a specified method. This fits the definition of 'Behavior' (""mentions... a plan to commit suicide"").
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the presence of a specific, albeit tentative, ""suicide date"" qualifies this as 'Behavior' because it indicates a step towards planning the act, rather than just having the thoughts or desires.

459,Happy people makes me suicidal. Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts because I know I will always be a loser who will never make friends. It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal"", ""suicidal thoughts"", ""kill myself"".
    - **Emotional indicators:** ""sad"", ""hurts so much"", ""loser"", ""never make friends"".
    - **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    - **References to past actions:** None.
    - **Imminence of stated intentions:** The post states ""I will probably never kill myself"" which explicitly negates imminence and intent to act.
    - **Writer's stated desire:** The writer experiences ""suicidal thoughts"" but explicitly states they ""will probably never kill myself"" due to religious reasons and expresses hope that ""my life will get better."" This indicates that while the thoughts are present, there is no current, personal desire to act on them, and a desire for life to improve.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. The post explicitly states ""I will probably never kill myself"" and expresses hope for life to get better.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, the phrase ""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better"" clearly indicates a lack of desire to act on the thoughts and a hope for improvement.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and thoughts (""Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts""). It explicitly negates a future intention to act (""I will probably never kill myself"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains ""suicidal thoughts"" but explicitly states ""I will probably never kill myself"" due to religious beliefs, and expresses hope for life to get better.
    - This fits the 'Indicator' definition: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die**."" The writer is experiencing suicidal thoughts but has a strong internal barrier against acting on them and a desire for improvement.
    - It does not fit 'Ideation' because there is no clear, current, personal desire to die or act on the thoughts; rather, the intent to act is explicitly negated.
    - It does not fit 'Behavior' as there is no plan, method, or preparation.
    - It does not fit 'Attempt' as there is no mention of a past initiated action.

Based on the explicit negation of intent to act on the suicidal thoughts and the hope for life to get better, the post falls under 'Indicator'.

I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one. this year has been such a beautiful downward spiral it would be an amazing way to end it, no?. i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""ending it all,"" ""suicide notes.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""awful year,"" ""lonely bastard,"" ""fucked it up,"" ""fucking idiot,"" ""no one wanted to be friends,"" ""one person left,"" ""so tired of failing everyone,"" ""can't fucking do another year."" These indicate profound despair, self-blame, isolation, hopelessness, and exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** ""thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" (specific timing/imminence), ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"" (clear preparation).
    *   **References to past actions:** ""made 3 other suicide notes this year."" These are past preparations, not initiated lethal actions.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** ""on new year's eve"" (specific, near-future date), ""can't fucking do another year.""
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire for life to end (""ending it all,"" ""can't fucking do another year"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""suicide notes,"" ""ending it all.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""thinking of ending it all,"" ""can't fucking do another year.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses an intention to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific *lethal method* (e.g., pills, gun, jump) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" Writing a suicide note is a direct act of preparation.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context. While no specific *method* is stated, the combination of explicit intent, specific timing (""on new year's eve""), and concrete preparation (""suicide notes"") clearly indicates a plan and preparations.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past failures, current despair, and a *future intention* (""thinking of ending it all on new year's eve""). It also mentions past *preparations* (""made 3 other suicide notes"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. Making notes is preparation, not an initiated lethal action. There is no mention of an actual attempt (e.g., taking pills, cutting, jumping) that was started.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there is clear, explicit personal suicidal intent and desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because beyond just thoughts/desire, there is a clear element of *preparation* (""suicide notes"") and *specific timing* for the intended act (""on new year's eve""). The definition of Behavior includes ""preparations being taken.""
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past or very recent *initiated lethal action* is described. Making notes is preparation, not an attempt.

Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent, a specific timeline, and concrete preparations (suicide notes) places this post in the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""tried to cut myself"" (explicit mention of self-harm and a specific method).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""breakdown,"" ""very bad night,"" ""wanted to feel something real"" (indicating severe distress).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""tried to cut myself"" indicates an initiated action using a method.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""last night"" clearly indicates a past action. ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"" confirms this was a new, initiated event for the author.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** The action occurred ""last night,"" so it's a very recent past event.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The motivation was ""wanted to feel something real"" during a ""breakdown."" While not explicitly ""I wanted to die,"" the action itself (""tried to cut myself"") is a potentially lethal self-harm behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Not explicitly stated as a desire to die, but the action of ""tried to cut myself"" during a breakdown is a serious self-harm behavior that can be suicidal in nature or outcome.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the action was initiated.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""cut myself"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The action was initiated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a *past event*: ""I tried to cut myself last night.""
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? Yes, ""tried to cut myself"" is a clear description of an initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly describes a past, self-initiated action by the author (""I tried to cut myself last night"") that was potentially lethal (cutting can be lethal). This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed to cause death (e.g., 'I tried to hang myself today but I stopped right before passing out')."" The timeframe (""last night"") makes it a very recent attempt. Even if the stated intent was ""to feel something real"" rather than explicitly ""to die,"" the action itself is a recognized method of self-harm with potential for lethality, making it an attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing and no one"", ""no purpose to live""), despair, self-blame (""because i became toxic"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The phrase ""plan to kill myself"" explicitly states a plan. While a specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is not detailed, the *existence* of a plan is stated.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: The statement ""plan to kill myself"" indicates a current, active intention. The follow-up ""Why shouldn't i?"" reinforces active consideration and imminence.
    - Stated desire: Clear desire to die/end life (""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""plan to kill myself"".
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? The post explicitly states ""plan to kill myself"". While the *details* of the method are absent, the *existence* of a plan is stated. The definition for 'Behavior' includes ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide"". This is a direct match. The question ""Why shouldn't i?"" further indicates active deliberation on this plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? A current/future intention (""plan to kill myself"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses personal suicidal intent and desire to die (""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    - The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by explicitly stating ""plan to kill myself"". This phrase indicates a concrete step towards action, even if the method is not specified. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide"". This is a direct fit.
    - There is no mention of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    - The key differentiator from 'Ideation' is the explicit mention of a ""plan"".

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** Explicitly states ""killing myself soon.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The tone is matter-of-fact, almost logistical, discussing the social implications of the act (""let folks know... or just surprise em""). This suggests a decided intent rather than just distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:** No specific method is mentioned. However, the phrase ""killing myself soon"" indicates high imminence and a firm intention to act. The discussion about ""let folks know you'll be killing myself soon or just surprise em"" is a form of preparation related to the social aftermath or logistics of the act, implying a decision to proceed. The statement ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"" reinforces a lack of desire to be prevented, indicating a firm resolve to act.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""soon"" indicates high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die and intent to act (""killing myself soon"").

    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""killing myself soon.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the entire post revolves around the impending act of ""killing myself.""
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite; they are discussing the logistics of carrying out the act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No specific method, tool, or location is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the discussion about ""let folks know you'll be killing yourself soon or just surprise em"" is a form of preparation related to the execution and aftermath of the act. It's a logistical consideration for the impending suicide. The high imminence (""soon"") coupled with this discussion of ""how it goes down"" points to a plan for action, even if the method is unstated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Future intention: ""you'll be killing yourself soon.""
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is clear, personal suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While it contains ideation, it goes beyond mere thoughts. The post discusses the *logistics* of the act (""let folks know... or just surprise em"") and expresses high imminence (""soon"") with a firm resolve (""no worries of being stopped""). This moves it into the realm of planning/preparation.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post expresses explicit personal suicidal intent (""killing myself soon"") with high imminence (""soon""). Crucially, it includes an element of preparation/planning by discussing the *how* of informing others about the impending act, which is a logistical consideration surrounding the suicide itself. The statement ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"" further emphasizes the resolve to act.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The post describes a future intention, not a past initiated action.

The combination of explicit intent, high imminence, and discussion of preparations/logistics for the act (even if the method is vague) points to Behavior.

    *   **Imminence of intentions:** ""I'm approaching"" the set date, indicating a near-future intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I want to kill myself"" indicates a strong and clear desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
    *   Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die.
    *   No, the writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions; rather, they state a clear intention to act.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned.
    *   However, there are clear signs of preparation and planning: ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching"" (planning a timeline) and ""Already started to cancel friendships"" (preparatory action). These actions go beyond mere ideation and indicate concrete steps towards an intended act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current desire and ongoing preparatory actions for a future intention (""approaching"" the ""set date"").
    *   It does *not* describe a past, specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The explicit statement ""I want to kill myself"" rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The presence of a ""set date"" and the action of ""started to cancel friendships"" are clear indicators of planning and preparation, which moves this beyond simple 'Ideation'. While a specific *method* isn't stated, the *plan* (date) and *preparatory actions* (canceling friendships) are sufficient to classify it as 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal act, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit desire to die, the setting of a date, and the preparatory action of canceling friendships, the post falls under 'Behavior'.

It never did, im not an introvert im not shy but i act like one for peace, i dont like to sleep all day i dont like to waste time but i have to so i dont kill myself, i dont like this shithole i live in but i cant change it. Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i dont kill myself"", ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""This life doesnt fit me,"" ""i dont like this shithole i live in,"" ""i cant change it."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and a feeling of being trapped.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" refers to a current struggle to prevent a future action, not a past initiated action.
    - Imminence: The phrase ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" suggests ongoing, current suicidal thoughts that the person is actively contending with. The question about suicide's badness implies active contemplation.
    - Writer's stated desire: ""This life doesnt fit me"" and the contemplation of suicide (""Is suicide really as bad... its just death"") strongly suggest a personal desire for life to end or a serious consideration of suicide as an option, even if they are currently fighting the urge to act. This is not merely distress about unwanted thoughts; it's a deep dissatisfaction with life and a contemplation of suicide as a solution.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide.""
    - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for life to end (""This life doesnt fit me"") and a contemplation of suicide as a solution (""Is suicide really as bad... its just death""). The phrase ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" implies the presence of a strong suicidal urge that the author is actively resisting, but the desire is clearly present.
    - The writer does not explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them in a way that negates personal desire. Instead, they indicate a struggle *against* the urge to act, while still contemplating the act itself. This leans towards Ideation.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
    - No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    - There is no vague reference to action implying a method or plan. The statement ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" is about preventing action, not planning it.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current struggle and contemplation (""i have to so i dont kill myself"", ""Is suicide really as bad..."").
    - It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author in the past.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") and a clear desire for life to end or profound dissatisfaction with life leading to contemplation of suicide (""This life doesnt fit me,"" ""Is suicide really as bad...""). This goes beyond general distress or merely unwanted thoughts, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    - While the author states they ""have to so i dont kill myself,"" indicating a struggle to *prevent* acting, the presence of the explicit thoughts and the contemplation of suicide as an option (e.g., ""Is suicide really as bad... its just death"") means it's more than just an 'Indicator'. The personal desire for life to end or the serious consideration of suicide is present.

Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

467,I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it. Thats it I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it simple as that,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Key elements: ""I want to die"" is repeated, indicating a clear desire for death.
    - Emotional indicators: Despair, self-perception of being a ""coward"" in relation to acting on the desire.
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.
    - Past actions: None mentioned.
    - Imminence: The desire is current, but the phrase ""too much of a coward to do it"" explicitly negates immediate action or a plan to act.
    - Stated desire: There is a genuine wish to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of death intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I want to die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer expresses a desire to die, but also a perceived inability to act on it due to cowardice. This is not the same as stating the *thoughts* are unwanted; the desire to die is present.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: The phrase ""too much of a coward to do it"" directly indicates a *lack* of intended action, plan, or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire (""I want to die"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die (""I want to die""), not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a plan, method, intended action, or preparations. In fact, the post explicitly states an inability to act (""too much of a coward to do it"").
    - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past or very recent self-initiated potentially lethal action.
    - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die without any indication of a plan, method, or intended action. This perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Goodbye,"" ""throw myself off a bridge,"" ""suicidal since i was 9,"" ""self-harmed,"" ""way of dying,"" ""last few seconds.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I cant take it,"" ""hated myself,"" ""tired of everything around me,"" ""at peace, no longer in pain"" (this peace is framed as a resolution to end suffering via suicide).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""throw myself off a bridge"" (specific method and location), ""Ive planned it all out"" (explicit statement of planning), ""locked in the bathroom"" (implies preparation/isolation for the act).
    *   **References to past actions:** ""suicidal since i was 9,"" ""i self-harmed."" These are past ideation and self-harm, not a past suicide attempt (an initiated, potentially lethal action).
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""possibly my last vent,"" ""decide to throw myself off a bridge"" (implies immediate intent), ""last few seconds i can ever memorize."" High imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to die and end life, expressed through the planned action and the ""peace"" found in this decision.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""throw myself off a bridge,"" ""way of dying."" (Yes)
    *   Expresses a clear desire to die/for life to end. (Yes)
    *   Does not state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted; rather, they are being acted upon.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Specific method/location mentioned: ""throw myself off a bridge."" (Yes)
    *   Signs of preparation: ""Ive planned it all out,"" ""locked in the bathroom."" (Yes)
    *   High imminence and intent clearly imply a specific method/plan.

    *   Describes a current/future intention: ""possibly my last vent before i littitimatly decide to throw myself off a bridge,"" ""Ive planned it all out,"" ""locked in the bathroom,"" ""last few seconds."" This indicates an imminent, planned action.
    *   Describes past events: ""suicidal since i was 9,"" ""self-harmed."" These are past ideation and self-harm, not a past *suicide attempt* (an initiated potentially lethal action). The primary focus and risk are on the current plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to clear, personal suicidal intent and a specific plan.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is not just ideation; there is a specific plan, method, and preparations mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. While past self-harm is mentioned, it does not describe a past *suicide attempt* (an initiated potentially lethal action by the author). The core of the post is about a *current* plan to act.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits perfectly. The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent (""Goodbye,"" ""way of dying"") AND a specific plan/method (""throw myself off a bridge""), clear preparations (""Ive planned it all out,"" ""locked in the bathroom""), and high imminence (""last vent,"" ""last few seconds"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

    - Emotional indicators: Despair, frustration, possibly related to the inability to get a boner.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The method is described as ""twist my dick off"" to cause ""blood loss"" leading to death. ""I'm gonna wait it off"" implies a waiting period as part of the plan. ""I sure am gonna try here"" indicates an intention to act.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: ""I'm gonna"" indicates current and future intent.
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to commit suicide and die.

    - The writer expresses a clear intent to act, not just unwanted thoughts.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:

    - Yes, there are signs of preparation/intended action: ""I'm gonna try here,"" ""I'm gonna wait it off.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes a current/future intention (""I'm gonna"").
    - It does not describe a past initiated action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm gonna commit suicide"") and a desire to die (""die of blood loss""). This fits 'Ideation'.
    - Crucially, it also includes a stated method (""twist my dick off"" leading to ""die of blood loss"") and an intention to act on it (""I sure am gonna try here,"" ""I'm gonna wait it off""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""Sayonara"" (farewell, implies departure/end), ""I will eventually die in a much painful way,"" ""no reason to live.""
    - Emotional indicators: ""disease are getting worse,"" ""body are getting weaker,"" ""painful way,"" ""endured the physical pain and mental depression for years,"" ""lonely,"" ""no reason to live."" These indicate severe despair, hopelessness, anhedonia, and a sense of being a burden/worthless.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. There is no indication of *how* the author intends to bring about this end, only the desire for it or resignation to it.
    - References to past actions: ""endured... for years"" refers to suffering, not past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence: ""Sayonara"" suggests a final farewell or imminent departure. ""I will eventually die"" combined with ""no reason to live"" implies a desired or accepted end, even if the timing is ""eventually."" The overall tone is one of resignation and a clear desire for life to end.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire for life to end (""no reason to live"") and a sense of finality (""Sayonara""). This is not about unwanted thoughts, but a personal expression of despair and a wish for cessation of life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""Sayonara"" and ""no reason to live"" strongly convey a desire for life to end. ""I will eventually die in a much painful way"" is a statement about their anticipated end, linked to their current despair.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is implied as personal and accepted.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. ""I will eventually die in a much painful way"" describes the *nature* of the anticipated death (painful) but not a *method* of suicide or a specific plan. It could be interpreted as a natural progression of their disease or a self-inflicted act, but no *method* of self-infliction is provided.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While the intent is high, there is no reference to *action* or *method* beyond the general idea of dying.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of suffering and a future intention/prediction of dying, coupled with a current lack of will to live.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear, personal expressions of a desire for life to end (""no reason to live,"" ""Sayonara""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide, ruling out 'Behavior'. The phrase ""I will eventually die in a much painful way"" speaks to the *experience* of dying, not a *method* of suicide.
    - It does not describe any past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    - It goes beyond general distress and explicitly states a desire for life to end, so it is not 'Indicator'.

Based on this analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end without detailing a specific plan or past action.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping), or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The question ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"" is a contemplation, not a plan.

Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone I know who *is* religious about this cause they just tell me I'm not being a good Christian or that I just need to ""give it to God."". Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff. I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""wants to die"" is explicitly stated. There's a discussion about ""going to hell"" in the context of dying, which implies a consideration of the act of dying by suicide.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Idk how to word this without sounding dumb,"" ""afraid,"" ""worrying,"" ""dumb thing,"" ""sorry to talk about this subject,"" ""sound dumb,"" ""whining,"" ""feeling really isolated."" These indicate distress, fear, and isolation.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""I am and have done some bad shit"" is general, not related to past suicidal actions.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The desire to die is current (""wants to die""), but the fear of hell is explicitly stated as ""one of the only things keeping me alive."" This indicates a current desire but a significant barrier to action, thus no immediate imminence.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear stated desire to die (""wants to die""). This desire is not explicitly stated as unwanted; rather, the *action* is inhibited by a specific fear.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""wants to die"" is a direct expression of a desire for life to end.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""wants to die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? The writer states they *want* to die, but are *afraid* of the consequences (hell), which is ""keeping me alive."" This means the desire is present, but action is inhibited, not that the desire itself is unwanted.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Imminence is low due to the stated barrier (""keeping me alive""), and there is no vague reference to action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire (""wants to die"") and a current conflict/barrier (""keeping me alive"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Distinguish 'Indicator' from 'Ideation': The post contains a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (""wants to die""). This goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion. The desire is not stated as unwanted; rather, the action is inhibited by fear. Therefore, it is not 'Indicator'.
    - Distinguish 'Ideation' from 'Behavior': While there is a clear desire to die (Ideation component), there is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. The explicit statement that a fear is ""keeping me alive"" directly contradicts the presence of a current plan or intended action. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    - Distinguish 'Behavior' from 'Attempt': No past or very recent initiated suicidal actions are described.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/desire to die but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations.

    *   **References to past actions:** ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"" refers to past *thoughts*, not initiated actions or attempts.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" suggests a deteriorating state and a potential future crisis point, but no immediate plan or high imminence for an action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The phrase ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" strongly implies a current desire to not be alive *if not for* the brother. ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"" indicates past personal suicidal ideation. There is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not want to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times.""
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" implies a desire to not be alive without that reason.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the post does not negate the desire to die. The brother is a *reason to stay alive*, not a negation of the underlying desire to die.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a vague reference to action coupled with high imminence? No, while the stress is high and coping is waning, there's no mention of an *action* or *how* they might act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes past ideation (""thought of killing myself multiple times""), current distress and a current coping mechanism (""only thing keeping me alive is my little brother""), and a future concern about coping (""I don't know how long I can cope"").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. ""I thought of killing myself"" refers to ideation, not an initiated action or attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I thought of killing myself multiple times"") and a desire to not be alive (""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother""). This rules out 'Indicator' as there is clear personal suicidal intent/ideation and it's not explicitly stated as unwanted.
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past or very recent *initiated action* that was potentially lethal. ""Thought of killing myself"" is ideation, not an attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts/desire to not be alive without any plan, method, or initiated action.

474,"Where can I find out how to die. I don't care if it's slow or painful or both, I just want to definitely die",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""how to die"", ""definitely die"".
    - Emotional indicators: A strong, definitive desire for death, indifference to pain or slowness, indicating profound despair and resolve.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific method is stated, but the phrase ""Where can I find out how to die"" is a direct inquiry about methods/means. This signifies an active search for a plan or method.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: Not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the active search for ""how to die"" implies a current and strong intent to find and potentially act on a method.
    - Writer's stated desire: A clear and unequivocal desire to die (""I just want to definitely die"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""how to die"" and ""definitely die"" are direct expressions of intent to end one's life.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just want to definitely die.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them? No, the desire is clearly personal and wanted.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Not explicitly, but the question ""Where can I find out how to die"" is a direct request for information on a method or plan. This is a step towards identifying or acquiring a method.
    - Are there signs of preparation? The active search for ""how to die"" can be considered a form of preparation, as it's seeking the necessary information to carry out an act.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The explicit desire to die is present, and the direct question ""Where can I find out how to die"" is a clear indication of seeking a *method* or *plan* to achieve that death. This goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current intention to find out how to die, implying a future action based on that knowledge.
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - **Indicator:** Not applicable. There is clear, personal suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    - **Ideation:** While there is strong ideation (""I just want to definitely die""), the post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires. The phrase ""Where can I find out how to die"" indicates an active step towards identifying a method or plan. It's not just wishing; it's seeking the means.
    - **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post expresses explicit personal suicidal desire (""I just want to definitely die"") AND actively seeks a plan or method (""Where can I find out how to die""). This active search for ""how to"" or a method is a direct step towards carrying out the suicidal intent, thus classifying it as 'Behavior'.
    - **Attempt:** Not applicable. No past initiated action is described.

The active inquiry for ""how to die"" in conjunction with a strong desire to die moves this beyond Ideation into Behavior, as it implies seeking a plan or method.

475,"It Never Quite Goes Away. I stick around for other people, but not because I want to be alive. It's not just that I don't see a future for myself, I just don't really want one either. It does get better, and then it gets worse, and then it gets better, and then worse, etc. I'm tired of buying time from myself over and over again. I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly? Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore. Maybe that's shitty. Maybe it's that 'indifference toward other people' that they were talking about when I got diagnosed with PTSD (still reeling from that one, it never seemed bad enough to me. Turns out not everyone lives in constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation). I just don't care. I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail. And in the meantime, I guess I'm still trying. I'm always trying.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""I don't want to be alive,"" ""will to die,"" ""If I do it,"" ""If I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail."" These are explicit mentions of suicidal desire and past/future suicidal acts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of buying time,"" ""tired of fighting to heal,"" ""don't care about them anymore,"" ""indifference,"" ""constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation,"" ""left alone."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** No specific method or plan for a future act is detailed. The phrase ""I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time"" refers to life plans to delay, not suicidal plans. ""If I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail"" implies a determination for a future attempt but doesn't specify *how*.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""If I do attempt again"" clearly indicates a past self-initiated suicidal action by the author.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out."" This indicates low imminence for a *future* act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire not to be alive and a ""will to die."" The writer is expressing personal suicidal intent.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions a ""will to die,"" not wanting to be alive, and refers to a future ""attempt."" This is a clear personal expression of suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   For a *future* act, no specific plan, method, or preparation is described. The statement ""If I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail"" suggests a determined future action, but lacks the specific details required for 'Behavior' (like ""pills,"" ""gun,"" ""bridge"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a future, non-immediate intention.
    *   Crucially, it describes a *past specific, self-initiated action*: ""If I do attempt again."" This phrase confirms that the author has made a suicide attempt in the past. This is the key element for the 'Attempt' category.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The presence of clear personal suicidal desire rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   While there is strong ideation and future intent, the lack of a *specific* plan/method for the *future* act means it doesn't fully fit 'Behavior' based on future intent alone.
    *   However, the post explicitly states a past suicide attempt (""If I do attempt again""). According to the definitions, ""The content describes past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal... This includes attempts described as historical... if the author brings them up in the context of their current feelings, thoughts, or struggles."" The author is clearly referencing a past attempt in the context of their ongoing struggles and future considerations.
    *   The rule "" 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author"" applies here.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is 'Attempt' due to the explicit mention of a past self-initiated suicidal action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Yes, another specific method (""kitchen knife"") is mentioned with increasing temptation and imminence (""Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there""). This indicates an intended action with a specific method.
    *   Yes, there's a clear reference to a ""plan"" (""Going by my plan"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current thoughts, increasing temptations, and future intentions/plans (""soon get the better of me,"" ""I'm going to take my life,"" ""need to wait another 480 days,"" ""can't wait any more,"" ""Each day I've been more tempted"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   Crucially, the post goes beyond mere thoughts by mentioning specific methods (""gun to the head,"" ""kitchen knife"") and a ""plan."" The increasing temptation to use the kitchen knife immediately (""can't wait any more,"" ""Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there"") clearly indicates an intended action with a method, even if the method is simple.

    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

477,"Does inpatient care help?. Did anyone having thoughts of suicide benefit from inpatient care? Do they start you on medication to help regulate your brain chem and moderate the progress?.

It just feels like everyone in my life is focused on their career goals and I can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Key elements: ""thoughts of suicide"" are explicitly mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live,"" ""can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do."" This indicates distress, feelings of failure, and a struggle for self-worth, but crucially, also a stated desire to *live*.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post is a question about seeking help (inpatient care) for these thoughts.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not explicitly stated as immediate action. The post is about seeking help for ongoing thoughts.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states, ""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live."" This is a strong indicator that while they have suicidal thoughts, they do not want to act on them and are actively seeking a way to overcome them and live.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""thoughts of suicide.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. On the contrary, the post expresses a desire to *live* and find the courage to do so.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, by stating ""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"" and asking about inpatient care as a way to ""help regulate your brain chem and moderate the progress"" regarding these thoughts. This implies the thoughts are unwanted and they are seeking a solution to them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - No high imminence coupled with vague reference to action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - The post describes current ""thoughts of suicide"" and a current struggle to live, along with seeking information about a potential future intervention (inpatient care).
    - It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author, past or present.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts of suicide."" This could lead to 'Ideation'.
    - However, the crucial distinguishing factor is the writer's explicit statement: ""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live."" This indicates that while they are experiencing suicidal thoughts, these thoughts are *unwanted*, and they are actively seeking help to *live* rather than to die.
    - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""It may include mentions of suicidal thoughts **only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die**."" This perfectly matches the user's post.
    - There is no plan, method, or intended action, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated action, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, despite the explicit mention of ""thoughts of suicide,"" the context of actively seeking help to *live* and the implied unwanted nature of these thoughts places it in the 'Indicator' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Another day of being mute,"" ""Three hours of lying in bed,"" ""Everyday is the same,"" ""Nothing to say ever,"" ""Can't sleep,"" ""No future."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, and a sense of futility.

    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""on Monday"" indicates a specific, near-future intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I'm really going to try and kill myself"" is a clear and direct expression of a desire to die and an intention to act on it.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

    *   While no preparations like ""writing a note"" are mentioned, the statement ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge"" constitutes a clear stated intention with a specific plan (day) and method/location.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a future intention (""on Monday"").
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'm really going to try and kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, it also includes a specific plan/method (""on Monday. Bridge""). This presence of a plan/method differentiates it from 'Ideation', which is defined as lacking such specifics.
    *   The action described is a *future intended action*, not a *past initiated action*. Therefore, it does not fit the definition of 'Attempt'.
    *   Based on the presence of explicit suicidal intent *and* a specific plan/method/intended action (even if future-oriented), the post best fits the 'Behavior' category.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Gah but it's so hard,"" ""One of the hardest decisions I've taken in my life,"" ""Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too"" - indicates significant distress and the difficulty of the decision.
    *   **Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations:**

        *   ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms."" - Implies a significant obstacle to suicide has been removed.
        *   ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it."" - Indicates a practical preparation/precondition has been met, removing a barrier to the act.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" refers to a past *removal of an obstacle*, not a past *attempted action*.
    *   **Imminence:** No specific timeframe like ""tonight"" but the language (""when I do it,"" ""before I go,"" ""overcame a big hurdle,"" ""now I'm sure"") suggests a readiness and intention for a future act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Very clear desire to die/kill self. ""kms"" is used personally and repeatedly. The ""hardest decisions I've taken in my life"" clearly refers to the decision to end life.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current intention and preparations for a future action.
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* by the author in the past. ""Overcame a big hurdle"" is about removing an obstacle to future action, not a past attempt.

    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, only ""I want to die,"" which is then negated.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? The initial ""I want to die"" suggests this, but the subsequent ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore"" directly negates the desire to die. This means the primary desire is to escape the current self/pain, not necessarily to cease to exist.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""I don't want to die"" explicitly states a lack of desire to die, even if the thought is present due to overwhelming pain. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: ""explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die.""

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and distress.
    *   It does not describe any past initiated potentially lethal actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound distress, hopelessness, and a desire for their current painful existence to end (""I don't want to be me anymore"").
    *   Crucially, despite the initial ""I want to die,"" the writer explicitly states ""I don't want to die."" This negation means there is no clear, current, personal expression of a *genuine* desire to die, but rather a desire for the suffering to cease. This perfectly fits the 'Indicator' definition, which allows for mentions of suicidal thoughts *only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die*.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because the explicit desire to die is negated. 'Ideation' requires a clear, personal expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to die *without* such a negation.

Therefore, the post falls under 'Indicator' due to the explicit negation of the desire to die, despite the overwhelming distress.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** ""Can't take it anymore,"" ""he'll be better off without me,"" ""thinking about just getting it over with."" These phrases strongly imply a desire to end their life. No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Can't take it anymore,"" ""feel like I failed my son,"" ""worthless as fuck,"" ""I love my son so much but I feel like he'll be better off without me."" These indicate extreme despair, hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness, and being a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None mentioned.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" suggests ongoing thoughts, not necessarily immediate action, but a clear contemplation of ending life.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear, personal desire for life to end (""he'll be better off without me,"" ""getting it over with""). The thoughts are not presented as unwanted; rather, they seem to be a considered option due to their despair.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not explicitly.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes. ""Can't take it anymore,"" ""he'll be better off without me,"" and ""thinking about just getting it over with"" all express a clear desire for life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is not negated. The thoughts are presented as a personal consideration.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. While there's high despair and desire to end life, ""getting it over with"" is too vague to imply a *method* or *plan*. There's no indication of *how* this would be done.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and ongoing thoughts/intentions (""I've been thinking about..."").
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses personal suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end (""he'll be better off without me,"" ""thinking about just getting it over with""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's more than general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. The phrase ""getting it over with"" does not provide any detail on *how* this would be achieved. This lack of a plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' – explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to not be alive, without any specific plan, method, or intended action.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

""Just recently, I purchased rope... I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was... I gave up."" These are all descriptions of initiated, potentially lethal actions.
    *   **Imminence of any stated intentions:** Very high for the recent action: ""Today, I have an exit bag set up,"" ""When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked."" This describes a very recent, initiated action.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""despair over my desire to die."" While there's fear (""scared of it failing and scared of dying""), it's clearly within the context of actively pursuing suicidal acts, not a rejection of the desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide,"" ""suicide note,"" and ""desire to die.""
    *   Yes, there is a clear desire for life to end, evidenced by the multiple attempts and current preparations, despite expressed fear.
    *   No, the writer does not state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions; the fear is about the outcome or process, not a negation of the intent.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, multiple specific methods are mentioned for past actions (aspirin, gun, rope/hanging) and current action (exit bag, gas valve).
    *   Yes, preparations are described for past actions (research, acquiring means, going to a location) and current action (""have an exit bag set up,"" ""done it perfectly"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past events and a very recent/current initiated action.
    *   It describes *specific, potentially lethal actions* that were initiated by the author in the past:
        *   ""I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills."" (Initiated action)
        *   ""when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened."" (Initiated action, even if misfire)
        *   ""I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was... I gave up."" (Initiated action)
    *   It also describes a very recent, initiated action: ""Today, I have an exit bag set up. ... When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked."" This is a clear initiation of a potentially lethal act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly goes beyond 'Indicator' as there is explicit personal suicidal intent and actions.
    *   It goes beyond 'Ideation' because not only are there explicit thoughts/desire, but also detailed plans, preparations, and, crucially, *initiated actions*.
    *   While there are current plans and preparations which could fall under 'Behavior', the core of the post, and the definition of 'Attempt', is the description of *past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal*. The post details three distinct past attempts (aspirin, gun, rope) and one very recent initiated action with the exit bag. According to the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation/behavior is also present. The recent action with the exit bag also fits the definition of an 'Attempt' as it was an initiated action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""should just end my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: ""Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile,"" ""garbage person,"" ""leech,"" ""will never accomplish anything"" indicate profound hopelessness, worthlessness, and self-loathing, suggesting the author feels like a burden.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: None are mentioned.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is given; it's a general statement of belief/desire.
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire for life to end, expressed as ""should just end my life for my benefit and the benefit of those around me."" This is not presented as an unwanted thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""end my life"" is a direct phrase.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""should just end my life"" clearly expresses this desire.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the statement is presented as a personal conviction.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan. Imminence is not high, and there is no vague reference to action beyond the general intent to ""end my life.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current belief/intention.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire (""should just end my life"") combined with intense feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out the suicidal intent. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life, without any specific plan, method, or preparation.

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past actions: None.
    *   Imminence: ""I'm about to"" (high imminence).
    *   Stated desire: A clear, personal desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes (""I don't see a reason to live"").
    *   Does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts? No, the intent is clearly expressed as personal desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Is there a vague reference to action implying a method or plan, especially with high imminence? The phrase ""I'm about to kill myself"" indicates imminent intent to act, but it does not specify *how* (method) or *what specific action* will be taken beyond the general outcome of ""killing myself."" The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action (even if the method is vague, like 'want to make the pain physical'), or preparations."" While ""kill myself"" is an intended action, it lacks the specific *how* or *means* that would typically move it to 'Behavior'. The instruction states: ""If there is genuine uncertainty about any plan, method, or intended action even after considering context, imminence, and intent, choose 'Ideation'."" In this case, there is no plan, method, or specific action *beyond* the general statement of suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current/future intention (""I'm about to"").
    *   No past initiated actions are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal, and explicit expression of suicidal intent and desire to die (""I'm about to kill myself,"" ""I don't see a reason to live"").
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past self-initiated suicidal action is described.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, with high imminence. This fits the core of 'Ideation'. For it to be 'Behavior', there must be a mention of a specific plan, method, intended action (with a *how*), or preparations. While the intent is imminent, the post lacks any detail about *how* the suicide will be carried out (e.g., ""take pills,"" ""jump,"" ""use a gun""). The phrase ""kill myself"" is the ultimate outcome, not a specific method or action in the sense required for 'Behavior'. Given the explicit instruction to choose 'Ideation' if there's genuine uncertainty about a plan/method/action, this post falls under 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""face death,"" ""until i die,"" ""if not, well, you know what happened"" (strongly implying death as an outcome).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm done,"" ""I'm too pissed,"" ""don't even want to feel good anymore,"" ""just gonna embrace the pain."" These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and a desire for an end to suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm now gonna start working out until i die or pass out."" This is a stated *intended action* with a specific *method* (working out to exhaustion/death). The phrase ""I'll be back in 12 hours if i survived to tell you how it went, if not, well, you know what happened"" clearly indicates a lethal intent behind the action.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""I'm now gonna start,"" ""I'll be back in 12 hours if i survived."" This indicates immediate or very near-future intent to act.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""don't even want to feel good anymore, just gonna embrace the pain and face death."" This is a clear, strong desire for death/life to end.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, not with those exact words.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""face death,"" ""until i die,"" and the implication of death if they don't return. This is a clear desire to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, they explicitly state they *will* act on them.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, the method is ""working out until i die or pass out."" While ""working out"" isn't a conventional suicide method, the *stated intent* (""until i die"") and the context of despair and embracing death, combined with the ""if i survived"" phrase, elevate this to a specific intended action with a method aimed at causing death.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations like notes or acquiring typical means, but the statement ""I'm now gonna start working out"" is an immediate declaration of an intended action.
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), consider if even a vague reference to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical,"" ""do something"") implies a method or plan in context. Here, the action is ""working out until i die or pass out,"" which is a specific method, coupled with high imminence (""I'm now gonna start"") and clear intent to die. This is not vague.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current/future intention: ""I'm now gonna start working out until i die.""
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, this is a future intended action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""face death,"" ""until i die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires. It states a specific *intended action* (""gonna start working out"") with a stated *method* (""until i die or pass out"") and a clear *imminent intent* (""I'm now gonna start""). The phrase ""if not, well, you know what happened"" reinforces the lethal intent of this action. This fits the definition of 'Behavior' because it includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND mentions a plan/intended action with a method, even if the method is unconventional.
    *   It is not an 'Attempt' because it describes a future action, not a past initiated one.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly states ""contemplated suicide for years,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" and ""plan to be dead long before I retire."" No specific methods or means are mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: The post presents a practical dilemma stemming from a firm suicidal intent, rather than raw emotional distress. The underlying sentiment is a settled conviction about future suicide.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The timing is vague (""maybe in my 20's or 30's"").
    - References to past actions: ""contemplated suicide for years"" refers to past thoughts/ideation, not past initiated actions.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: The imminence is low, stated as ""maybe in my 20's or 30's,"" indicating a long-term future intention, not immediate or near-future.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, stated desire and certainty about future death by suicide (""I know I am going to do it,"" ""plan to be dead""). The writer is not expressing distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts; rather, they are grappling with the practical implications of a chosen future suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""contemplated suicide,"" ""I know I am going to do it"" (referring to suicide).
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""plan to be dead long before I retire.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the writer expresses certainty about acting on them in the future.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. Imminence is low (""in my 20's or 30's""), and there is no vague reference to *how* the action would be carried out.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a long-term future intention (""I know I am going to do it,"" ""maybe in my 20's or 30's"") and past contemplation (""contemplated suicide for years"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No, ""contemplated"" refers to thoughts, not actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post clearly expresses a personal and certain intention to die by suicide (""I know I am going to do it,"" ""plan to be dead""). This rules out 'Indicator' because it's not general distress or unwanted thoughts; it's a clear personal desire.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for carrying out the suicide. The timeframe is also very distant (""in my 20's or 30's""), further indicating a lack of immediate planning. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. ""Contemplated"" refers to thoughts, not an attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" directly asks about lethality, implying a suicidal context.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The question itself, combined with ""saving for later,"" implies distress and consideration of ending life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   Method: ""duloxetine,"" ""a few pills"" (specific substance and means).

    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the combination of asking about the lethality of a specific substance and stating they are ""saving"" it for later strongly implies a personal desire to use it to die.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is implied; they are actively considering and preparing.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? Yes, ""duloxetine"" and ""pills"" are a specific substance/method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I've been saving for later"" is a clear act of preparation (acquiring and retaining the means).
    *   Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The desire is strongly implied, and the method (duloxetine pills) and preparation (""saving for later"") are explicit.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of preparation (""saving for later"") and a future intention to use the pills.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') because there's a clear implied personal suicidal intent.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desire ('Ideation') because it explicitly mentions a *specific method* (""duloxetine,"" ""pills"") and a *preparation* (""saving for later""). These elements constitute a plan or preparation.
    *   It does not describe a *past initiated action*, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The presence of implied suicidal intent, a specific method, and preparation clearly fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

488,I really need to stop feeling this way. No really. I've been lying when I say it's not that bad. Today's a great day. It's hell. If anyone or anything truely cared about my life I know it isn't me. Not anymore. I feel so empire. So out of place with everyone I'm around. I just want to end but haven't yet.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The phrase ""I just want to end"" clearly indicates a desire for life to end.
    - Emotional indicators: ""I really need to stop feeling this way,"" ""It's hell,"" ""I feel so empire (likely 'empty' or 'impure' given context, indicating profound negative feelings),"" ""So out of place,"" ""If anyone or anything truely cared about my life I know it isn't me. Not anymore."" (loss of self-worth/will to live).
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    - References to past actions: ""haven't yet"" refers to the *lack* of past action, confirming no attempt has occurred.
    - Imminence: The desire is current (""I just want to end"").
    - Writer's stated desire: There is a clear desire for life to end (""I just want to end"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""I just want to end"" is a strong implication of wanting life to cease.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I just want to end"" and ""If anyone or anything truely cared about my life I know it isn't me. Not anymore.""
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire is expressed as personal intent (""I just want to end"").

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - If explicit desire to die is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan: While there's a desire to ""end,"" there's no ""how"" or ""what"" to suggest a plan or method, even vaguely. The phrase ""haven't yet"" indicates the desire is present but no action or specific plan has materialized.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire/intention (""I just want to end"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No, the phrase ""haven't yet"" explicitly states that no such action has been taken.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains clear, personal expressions of a desire for life to end (""I just want to end""). This moves it beyond general distress or abstract thoughts.
    - There is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation for carrying out this desire. The phrase ""haven't yet"" reinforces the absence of action or concrete planning.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    - The clear personal desire to end life means it is not 'Indicator', which is reserved for general distress or explicitly unwanted suicidal thoughts.
    - Therefore, the content fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""dead by the end of the day today,"" ""off myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired,"" ""fatigue,"" ""brain is my body's worst enemy,"" implied struggle and frustration (""Why has it taken so long?"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""buy the gas"" is mentioned as the necessary step to ""off myself."" This implies a method involving gasoline (e.g., self-immolation, carbon monoxide poisoning). The author states that if they ""put my mind to it,"" they ""could be dead by the end of the day today,"" indicating a clear, imminent intention, with the only barrier being the acquisition of the means.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""by the end of the day today"" indicates very high imminence.
    *   **Stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die (""I could be dead,"" ""off myself""). The fatigue is presented as a practical obstacle to acting on this desire, not a lack of desire itself.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""off myself,"" which is a direct phrase for suicide.
    *   It expresses a clear desire to die: ""I could be dead by the end of the day today."" The question ""Why has it taken so long?"" reinforces this desire.
    *   The writer does *not* state they do not want these thoughts or do not want to act on them. Instead, fatigue is presented as the *barrier* to acting on the desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   A specific method/means is mentioned: ""buy the gas."" While the exact *action* with the gas isn't detailed, ""gas"" is a specific substance used in suicidal acts.
    *   The statement ""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas"" clearly links the acquisition of this specific means to the ability to commit suicide. This indicates a plan where the acquisition of the means is the missing step.
    *   Given the high imminence (""by the end of the day today"") and explicit desire, the mention of a specific means (""gas"") moves this beyond mere ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a current intention and a potential future action (""could be dead by the end of the day today"").
    *   It does not describe any past initiated potentially lethal actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (""dead by the end of the day today,"" ""off myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by mentioning a specific means/method (""buy the gas"") that is necessary to carry out the act, and states that if they overcome the fatigue to acquire this means, the act could occur ""by the end of the day today."" This constitutes a plan with a specific method, even if the method's *execution* is currently inhibited by a practical barrier (fatigue preventing leaving the house to buy the gas). This moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal intent, high imminence, and a specific (though currently unacquired) method/means points to 'Behavior'.

490,"I should stop being a pussy and do it. I post about suicide constantly, I should just suck it up and do it already.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and repeatedly uses the phrase ""do it,"" which in context clearly refers to committing suicide. No specific method or means is mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: The phrases ""stop being a pussy"" and ""suck it up"" indicate self-criticism, frustration, and a desire to overcome internal barriers to act on suicidal thoughts.
    - Specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations: None are mentioned. ""Do it"" is entirely vague regarding the method.
    - References to past actions: ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to past *expressions* or *communications* about suicide, not past self-initiated suicidal *actions* or attempts.
    - Imminence of any stated intentions: ""should just suck it up and do it already"" suggests a desire for action soon, but does not specify an immediate timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It's more about overcoming resistance to act.
    - Assess the writer's stated desire: There is a clear, personal desire to ""do it"" (commit suicide). The writer is expressing frustration at *not* having acted on these thoughts yet.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""post about suicide constantly"" and the clear implication of ""do it"" referring to suicide.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""I should stop being a pussy and do it,"" ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" clearly indicates a desire to commit suicide.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, quite the opposite. The writer expresses a desire to *act* on them and frustration at their own inaction.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No. The phrase ""do it"" is completely devoid of any specific method, tool, or location.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. While there is a strong desire to act, the imminence is not immediate (""tonight,"" ""now""), and the ""do it"" is too vague to imply a specific method or plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current desire and future intention (""should do it"").
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No. ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to past communication, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and a desire to act on it (""I should stop being a pussy and do it""). This rules out 'Indicator' because the suicidal desire is explicit and not unwanted.
    - However, the post lacks any specific plan, method, intended action (beyond the vague ""do it""), or preparations. While there's a strong desire to act, the *how* is completely absent. This prevents it from being classified as 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action. Therefore, it is not an 'Attempt'.
    - Based on the presence of explicit personal suicidal intent without any specific plan, method, or preparation, the post best fits 'Ideation'.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:**
        *   ""I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself)."" - This describes past self-harm.
        *   ""And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January."" - Mentions a past plan for suicide.
        *   ""but now it time to stop the lie and end it."" - Expresses a desire for life to end.
        *   ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" - Explicitly states a current plan for suicide, including a method (hanging), a specific location, and a preceding self-harm act (cutting finger with axe).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""done and happy"" (paradoxical, suggests resignation), ""big relief,"" ""done with everything,"" ""unmotivated to find motivation,"" ""weird feeling."" Despite ""happy,"" the context is clearly about ending life due to being ""done with everything.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   Past: ""planned to kill myself in the forest in January."" (This plan was not executed: ""But I didn't"").
        *   Current/Future: ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" This is a detailed plan.
        *   Preparations: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car."" - Explicitly states means are acquired and ready.
    *   **References to past actions:**
        *   ""I started to cut my rights leg more and more..."" - Past self-harm.
        *   ""And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't..."" - Past plan, explicitly stated as *not* carried out.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** ""now it time to stop the lie and end it."" ""So I plan to hang myself..."" - Indicates a current, active intention.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear desire to end life (""end it,"" ""plan to hang myself""). The ""happy"" is presented as a state of acceptance of this decision, not a desire to live.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""plan to hang myself,"" and ""end it,"" showing a clear desire to die.
    *   The writer does *not* state these thoughts are unwanted; rather, they are presented as a decided course of action.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""hang myself""), tools (""rope,"" ""axe""), and location (""highest tree of the forest"") are mentioned.
    *   Yes, preparations are explicitly stated: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes both past events (self-harm, past unexecuted suicide plan) and a current/future intention (the detailed plan to hang self).
    *   It does *not* describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was *initiated* by the author in the past as a suicide attempt. The past self-harm was for ""calming down,"" not described as an attempt. The past plan to ""kill myself in January"" was explicitly stated as ""But I didn't.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die and end life, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes significantly beyond mere thoughts or feelings of suicide ('Ideation') because it details a specific plan (""plan to hang myself""), a method, a location, and explicitly states that preparations are complete (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""). This firmly places it in 'Behavior'.
    *   While past self-harm and a past unexecuted plan are mentioned, there is no description of a past *initiated suicidal action* by the author (an attempt). Therefore, 'Attempt' is not the primary classification. The current, detailed plan and preparation are the most prominent and concerning elements.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death/dying: ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"", ""I wish I was never born"", ""don't really want to die"".
    - Emotional indicators: Expresses existential despair, hopelessness, questioning the point of life (""dumbest shit ever"", ""no point for us being here"").
    - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence: Not applicable.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer explicitly states ""don't really want to die,"" which directly negates a personal desire to die, despite the preceding existential despair.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? While ""I wish I was never born"" implies a desire not to exist, the immediate follow-up ""but at the same time don't really want to die"" directly contradicts and negates a current, personal desire to die.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Yes, ""don't really want to die"" is a clear statement that the writer does not want to die, even while expressing profound despair.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Describes current feelings and philosophical thoughts. No past or future actions are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and existential thoughts about the futility of life.
    - The crucial element is the explicit negation of a personal desire to die: ""don't really want to die.""
    - According to the definitions, 'Indicator' applies when the post ""lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author"" and ""may include mentions of suicidal thoughts only if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die.""
    - This fits the post perfectly. It's not 'Ideation' because the desire to die is explicitly negated. There's no plan/method/action, so it's not 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Shame (""very ashamed,"" ""fucked up,"" ""disgusting""), fear (""afraid of everyone will think of me""), distress (""I really need help"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None related to suicide.
    *   **References to past actions:** Mentions buying a ""pocket pussy"" and starting Nofap in the past, but these are not suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No suicidal intentions are stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses distress over social judgment and shame, and asks ""What do I do?"", indicating a desire for help with their current situation, not a desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   **Explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases?** No.
    *   **Clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end?** No. The post focuses on social embarrassment and fear of judgment.
    *   **If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them?** Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation related to suicide is mentioned or implied.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past event (buying the item), a current emotional state (shame, fear), and a future concern (starting a new school).
    *   It does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, shame, and fear.
    *   However, it completely lacks any mention of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, or any plans/methods/actions related to suicide.
    *   The user is asking for advice on how to deal with a social situation, which indicates a desire to cope rather than end their life.
    *   This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""they don't let you kill yourself"" directly mentions ""kill yourself"" and implies a personal desire to do so, or at least a strong frustration at being prevented from doing so.
    - Emotional indicators: High levels of frustration, anger (""selfish,"" ""asshole move,"" ""what the fuck is wrong with you?""), and a sense of suffering (""why do you want me to suffer"").
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    - References to past actions: No past actions are described.
    - Imminence: The post reflects a current, intense emotional state, but no specific timeline for action is given.
    - Writer's stated desire: The writer clearly expresses a desire to end their life (""they don't let you kill yourself"") and views this as a solution to their suffering, indicating a genuine wish for life to end.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? Yes, ""kill yourself.""
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, the frustration about being prevented from ""kill yourself"" strongly implies a personal desire to die to end suffering.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the opposite is true; they are frustrated by being prevented from acting on them.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - There is a clear desire to die, but no indication of *how* or *when* in terms of a plan or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes a current state of mind and frustration.
    - Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire (""they don't let you kill yourself"" in a context of wanting to end suffering). This rules out 'Indicator' because the desire is clearly personal and not unwanted or abstract.
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, intended action, or preparations. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    - There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear personal desire for life to end/suicidal intent without any associated plan or action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means: ""pls fucking end me"", ""im going to do it"". These are direct expressions of suicidal intent and desire for death. No specific method is mentioned.
    - Emotional indicators: ""lonely"", ""Nobody fucking cares"", ""Im such a spoiled piece of shit"" - indicates loneliness, feelings of being a burden, self-loathing, and despair.
    - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method, tool, or preparation is mentioned. ""im going to do it"" is a statement of intent to act, but lacks specifics of *how*.
    - References to past actions: None.
    - Imminence of stated intentions: ""before the day"" - indicates high imminence (today).
    - Writer's stated desire: Clear desire to die (""pls fucking end me"") and intention to act (""im going to do it"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:
    - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No, but ""pls fucking end me"" and ""im going to do it"" are strong, direct expressions of suicidal desire and intent.
    - Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? Yes, ""pls fucking end me"" and ""im going to do it"" clearly express this.
    - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? No, the desire and intent are clearly present and expressed as personal.

3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:
    - Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    - Are there signs of preparation? No.
    - Crucially, if explicit desire to die (from step 2) is present and has high imminence, consider if even a vague reference to action implies a method or plan in context. The phrase ""im going to do it"" is a direct statement of an *intended action*. While the method is vague, the high imminence (""before the day"") and clear desire to die (""pls fucking end me"") lean towards this being more than just ideation. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""an intended action (even if the method is vague... especially if coupled with high imminence)"". This fits.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:
    - Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? Current/future intention (""im going to do it"", ""before the day"").
    - Does it describe a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    - Not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and intent to act.
    - Not 'Attempt' because no past initiated action is described.
    - The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    - 'Ideation' is for expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire *without* any specific plan, method, *intended action*, or preparations.
    - 'Behavior' is for expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire *AND* a plan, method, *intended action*, or preparations.
    - The phrase ""im going to do it"" is a direct statement of an *intended action*. Coupled with the high imminence (""before the day"") and the clear desire to die (""pls fucking end me""), this meets the criteria for 'Behavior' as it indicates an intent to act, even if the specific method is not detailed. The definition explicitly allows for vague methods when intent and imminence are high.

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I hope it'll be me next,"" ""suicide,"" ""another stabbing"" (referring to their own potential death).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family"" indicates feelings of being a burden or shame, which are common in suicidal ideation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A method of death (""stabbing"") is mentioned, but the phrasing ""I hope it'll be me next"" indicates a desire for an external event to cause their death, rather than a self-initiated plan or action. There are no preparations mentioned.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** ""next"" implies a future desire, but contingent on an external event.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** There is a clear desire to die (""I hope it'll be me next"") and for life to end, specifically to avoid the perceived shame of a self-initiated suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Explicitly mentions ""suicide"": Yes.
    *   Expresses a clear desire to die: Yes, ""I hope it'll be me next"" is a clear desire for death.
    *   Does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or actions? No, the desire is clearly stated.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method/tool/substance/location mentioned? Yes, ""stabbing"" is mentioned as the desired method of death.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, is this a *self-initiated* plan/method/action? No. The user is *hoping* to be a victim of an external event (""I hope it'll be me next""), not stating an intention to commit the act themselves. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, an intended action, or preparations being taken"" *by the author*. Since the desire is for an external event to cause death, it doesn't fit 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Describes a future intention (""hope it'll be me next"").
    *   Does not describe a past initiated action by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Not Indicator, as there is a clear, personal expression of desire to die and explicit mention of suicide, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. There is an explicit personal expression of a desire to die (""I hope it'll be me next"") and suicidal thoughts/context (""suicide it'll be just another stabbing""). While a method (""stabbing"") is mentioned, it's framed as something the author *wishes to happen to them* (an external event), not a plan or intended action that the author will *carry out themselves*. The core of Ideation is the presence of desire for death/suicidal thoughts without a self-initiated plan/method/action.
    *   **Behavior:** This is not Behavior because, despite mentioning a method (stabbing), the post does *not* indicate a *self-initiated* plan or intended action by the author. The phrasing ""I hope it'll be me next"" clearly implies a desire for an external event, not an internal plan for self-harm.
    *   **Attempt:** No past or very recent initiated action is described.

Therefore, the post expresses a strong desire for death and suicidal thoughts, but lacks a self-initiated plan or action.

497,"how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?. okay so i will go straight to the point and i dont want any affection or ""oh dont do that your life is more worth than that and blablabla"" im 19 i have 0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money, i want to put an end to it all but there is something blocking me to do that and ots my family, how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it? maybe was just an accident idk, thanks and sorry for the bad english",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""kill myself"" (repeated), ""put an end to it all"", ""disappear"" (in context of suicide).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money"" indicates profound despair, hopelessness, and feeling like a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user asks ""how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?"" and ""how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it?"". This describes a *plan* involving specific preparatory actions: running away, disappearing, going to another country, and getting a new identity, all explicitly stated as steps *before* killing themselves. While the *final* method of suicide isn't specified, the *preparatory plan* is detailed.
    *   **References to past actions:** None.
    *   **Imminence:** Not immediate (requires running away first), but the user is actively seeking *how* to implement this plan, indicating current intent and planning.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** Clear and explicit desire to die (""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all""). They explicitly reject intervention (""i dont want any affection or 'oh dont do that'"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" multiple times and expresses a clear desire to ""put an end to it all.""
    *   The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; they are the core desire.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   While a specific *method* (e.g., pills, gun) is not mentioned, a clear *preparatory plan* is outlined: ""run from everyone,"" ""disappear,"" ""go to another country,"" ""have another identity."" These are concrete steps the user is asking *how* to execute, directly linked to facilitating the suicidal act. This goes beyond mere ideation into planning/preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a future intention and a plan to achieve it (""how to run... so i can just kill myself?"").
    *   No past initiated actions are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses explicit personal suicidal intent (""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desire by describing a *plan* for preparation (""how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?"", ""how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it?""). This detailed preparatory plan, even without a specific final method, constitutes 'Behavior' because it involves intended actions/preparations for carrying out suicide.
    *   There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the presence of a detailed preparatory plan (disappearing, changing identity, going to another country) explicitly stated as a precursor to suicide, combined with clear suicidal intent, classifies this as Behavior.

But Plan B's gonna be more painful. This is the least pain-proof way I could die. Oh, and one more thing. If God doesn't take me to Heaven, then he's a dumb, selfless bitch. People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/methods:** The post explicitly states ""tried to kill myself last night,"" ""EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF,"" ""I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT,"" ""I'm gonna try again tonight,"" ""another plan in mind,"" and ""killing theirselves."" A specific method is mentioned for the past action: ""suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""had enough of this,"" ""Unfortunately, I'm still alive,"" ""WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY!"", ""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!"", ""THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!"". These indicate extreme despair, frustration, and a strong desire for death.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post details a past *initiated* action (""tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag""). It also states a clear intention to act again ""tonight"" and mentions having ""another plan in mind"" (Plan B), implying future methods.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""tried to kill myself last night"" and ""EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF"" clearly refer to past initiated suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence:** The past action was ""last night."" The stated future intention is ""tonight,"" indicating high imminence.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** ""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!"" and ""THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!"" unequivocally express a genuine desire to die.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!"", ""THIS NEEDS TO END!"").

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, a specific method (""suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag"") was used in a past action.
    *   Yes, there is a stated intention to ""try again tonight"" (implying the same or similar method) and the existence of ""another plan in mind"" (Plan B).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post describes a past event: ""I tried to kill myself last night."" This is a clear description of a self-initiated, potentially lethal action.
    *   It also describes a current/future intention: ""I'm gonna try again tonight.""
    *   The key here is the explicit description of an *initiated action* by the author in the past (""last night""). This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong suicidal ideation and intent (""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!"", ""THIS NEEDS TO END!"").
    *   It describes a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that occurred ""last night"" (""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag""). This is the defining characteristic of an 'Attempt'.
    *   While there are also clear elements of 'Behavior' (plan for ""tonight,"" ""another plan in mind""), the presence of a clearly described *past initiated action* by the author takes precedence according to the provided rules. The definition of 'Attempt' explicitly includes ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Just don't want to get out of bed,"" ""soooo tired,"" ""just want to sleep 24/7,"" ""feel empty,"" ""worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔"". These indicate fatigue, anhedonia, emptiness, and concern about mental health, consistent with depressive symptoms.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past actions:** ""another depressive episode"" indicates a history of depression, but not suicidal actions.
    *   **Imminence of stated intentions:** No suicidal intentions are stated.
    *   **Writer's stated desire:** The writer expresses extreme fatigue and emptiness, but explicitly lists positive aspects of their life (""lot to be happy about,"" ""inclusive team,"" ""uni,"" ""amazing bf,"" ""awesome best friend,"" ""4 months on hrt""). There is no stated desire to die or for life to end; rather, they express distress about their current emotional state and its potential impact on their life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
    *   Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases? No.
    *   Does the post express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end? No. Phrases like ""just want to sleep 24/7"" indicate extreme fatigue and a desire for escape through rest, not a desire for death. ""Feel empty"" is a symptom of depression. There is no expression of wanting life to end.
    *   If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, does the writer explicitly state they *do not* want these thoughts or *do not* want to act on them? Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all.

3.  **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Is a specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned or strongly implied in relation to a suicidal act? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Does the post describe a past event, a current/future intention, or both? It describes current feelings and a future worry about a depressive episode.
    *   Does it describe a *specific, potentially lethal action* that was initiated by the author in the past? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress, fatigue, emptiness, and worry about a depressive episode.
    *   It *lacks* any clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The listed positive life aspects further support that the distress is not about wanting to end life, but about struggling with current feelings.
    *   There are no mentions of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions.
    *   Therefore, it best fits the 'Indicator' category, as it describes general distress and symptoms of depression without any explicit or implied suicidal ideation or intent.
