508,"I frequent the suicide prevention center Pretty much the title.  Every so often I visit the suicide prevention center (with a mask of course) and talk to someone just outside the entrance of the suicide prevention center.  I typically go in the middle of the night after drinking (it's open 24 hours a day where I live).   I could call them of course...but I like the in person visits. I have so many of their cards with the phone number on them (one for each visit) like a deranged collection of pokemon cards (depressed pokemon used self destruct...it was super effective!).  Here's what I typically ramble to them (while drunk):  ""Life is fundamentally absurd and futile.""  ""We are all born for no reason, work pointless jobs, and then fucking die!""  ""Humanity is a collection of delusional and egotistical apes..I hate being a person!""  ""I have nothing to look forward too and we are all pretty much fucked on a global scale""  ""I'm a piece of shit who was born in a middle class family in a developed nation..and I have wasted so many opportunities. I deserve to live and die in misery.""  ""I want to hit positive people in the face with my frying pan!""   "" I want to die in my sleep!!"" Or ""Fuck this shitty world!""  I say all these things with a few variations here and there.  I then typically burst into tears. The person listens and talks with me a little. I feel slightly better. Then I go home and sleep. The next morning I typically feel better..not amazing..but better.  There really is no point to this story...just stating one of my habits that relates to this sub.

542,"First time I ever consider suicide Sorry for the long post.       I never considered suicide until last year, but I don't think I can go on much longer.        I'm from Lebanon, a small country in the Middle East. You may have heard about it in the news. This country that had an extraordinarily rich culture, perfect geography, and infinite potential, has turned to a literal hell hole in the span of a year and a half. And the worst is yet to come.           In 2019 I was 22, freshly graduated, and had my first job. I had moved out and started living independently, life was fucking great but I didn't realize it back then. I'll spare you the political and economical details unless someone is interested, but in October everything started turning to shit. The effects of decades of widespread corruption and sectarian division started to show, and the economy started going downhill.        I lost my job in January of 2020, along with a huge chunk of the population. I had to start financially relying on my parents again, which already took away what I enjoyed the most in my life: the fact I was finally a self-sufficient, responsible person. Then covid hit. And then on August 4th 2020, what some of you may know Lebanon for, happened.       The third biggest non-nuclear explosion in the history of mankind happened in the heart of Beirut, the capital. It created a shockwave that was felt all the way to Cyprus, a fucking ISLAND 200 kilometers away from Lebanon. Why? Because the government was so corrupt and negligent that thousands of tons of explosive chemicals were dangerously stored in a warehouse and caught fire.      Thankfully my family and I lived far enough from the explosion to suffer nothing but shattered windows, but I was a few hundred meters away from the blast when it happened. You can find footage of the explosion online, so I don't think I have to go in detail as to what happened. I knew my family were home so I didn't worry about them, but my grandpa lived even closer to the blast than I was, and phones were unusable. I started running towards his home, as I anticipated seeing him crushed by rubble.      The thought of describing what I saw that day, running through the city where I made my strongest friendships, found love, studied, graduated, and got into the professional world, already has me shaking and crying.     Entire houses and buildings I knew had turned into rubble. The road was a sea of glass, stone, and cement. Sirens, people shouting, screaming, crying, everywhere. I don't even want to think about how many dead people I ran by. I don't think anyone can even make a movie like this. I think I'm gonna stop talking about this.     Thankfully my grandpa only suffered minor injuries. I'm glad I wasn't the one to take him to the hospital because I don't think I could have taken it. I've heard stories and seen videos of destroyed hospitals, that were already crowded with covid cases, walls and floors covered in blood and doctors performing surgeries on the floor.       This was the last straw for Lebanon. In 2019, 1$ was equivalent to 1500 Lebanese pounds. Today, it's 13800, and increasing by the day. Medicine, fuel, electricity, and food are becoming less and less accessible. People are fighting in supermarkets over bread or milk for their kids. Lebanon is the poorest, hungriest, and most politically unstable it has ever been. Robberies and violence are becoming routine. We're headed to a collapse that will be remembered in history books as a case study of how corrupt, evil, greedy, and hateful humans can get.     And then there's me. I've spent the last few months alone in my appartment because of lockdowns and the financial crisis, with no job, no foreign passport or any other way to get out of this hell hole, and nothing to do except watching netflix or playing video games when the electricity and internet connection allow it. I roll a joint the second I wake up because I don't think I can face this life sober for a single hour.       Millions of people around the world go through poverty, traumas and wars, but what kills me from the inside is remembering the life I had, and could have had. I was a regular kid from a regular family, had friends, went to school, and was about to live a normal life. Now I understand how valuable this is. Many of my friends managed to leave or had already left to study abroad before the crisis. The others I barely see anymore. I can't imagine what my parents are going through, raising me for all these years just for me to have my life taken away from me like that.  I have no one to open up to, which is why I'm writing on a new account.       Now I can't do anything other than being a spectator of my own existence and watch hell break loose from my window, holding on to the memory of the two decades of ""normal life"" I had. I guess I'll just continue to exist until I find the courage to get this over with, or until some other mega bomb goes off next to my home.       I beg you to enjoy every friend, family member, pet, every meal in a restaurant, every roadtrip, every party,  every exam, hour spent at work, every laughter, every argument, every fight, every kiss, and every drink as if they were the last you will ever have, because they might very well be.",ideation

Today for some dumb reason i decided to turn on my old Wii to feel some nostalgia but instead of the good one my brain just threw in trauma and bad memories that got triggered by the games I was playing I just keep remembering stuff thatwqs supposed to be forgotten and I don't know how to deal with it Every day I get worse and worse and I just want to take the courage already I can't take it anymore nothing makes sense I don't deserve to be happy I just want it all to end I can't dothis anymore",ideation

572,Severe hypochondriac/health anxiety sufferer I panic about the most rare diseases every day like rabies and cjd. I worry about rabies so much i have considered suicide to be free of my obsessive thoughts. I live in a country with only 3 domestic cases of rabies. So yesterday morning i woke up and walked to get breakfast and i saw my brother with a wound on his nose. I told him about it as it looked like he didn‚Äôt notice. He didnt care but i started worrying that a bat bit his nose while he was sleeping (we never saw a bat in our lives) and i found a sticky gum like thing thats white. Its really big and i stepped on it a couple times it feels like gum. So i convinced myself that it was saliva of a rabid animal who flew in. He didn‚Äôt worry at all. I later told him about my fears. He started panicking. I panicked too. I didnt really give a shit wether or not i had rabies because im going to kill myself soon but i REALLY didn‚Äôt want him to get rabies. He later moved on and forgot about the fear because Of how rare rabies is in My country and the extremely small posibility that a rabid animal could have flew in without causing damage.

573,"I‚Äôve usually been a spectator I‚Äôve been spectating this sub for a while now (I have an older profile that I kind of abandoned, hence why this one is so new), but I need to get a couple things off of my chest.   I‚Äôve ‚Äúattempted‚Äù suicide 4+ times (varying degrees, ig. 4 times it was seriously fucking serious)   One of those times was when I was 12 years old.   As I wasn‚Äôt a teen yet, they had to find my a psychiatric hospital with a children‚Äôs unit. They put my in a hospital hours a way from my home. It was abusive. Locking us away in empty, cinderblock rooms for no reason. Making us strip and having only one adult watch us as we do so. No soap (I got so sick with diarrhea that I passed out). Most staff came in high or hungover to the point of barely functioning. Stuffed in a little unventilated room with kids continually messing themselves. Watching endless movies. They sedated me beyond necessary, giving me some kind of ADHD med from the 80s or some shit, so they could focus on the homicidal patients. Oh yeah, forgot to add that I saw people try to kill each other, saw people stab themselves, etc.) One person on the teen‚Äôs unit was getting violent threats against her by other teen patients *because she patient threatened to do sexual things to them*. Naturally, the crackhead staff decided, in order to protect her, they should put her on the children‚Äôs unit. One thing led to another and now I have diagnosed PTSD.   My eldest brother has a lengthy history of verbal, physical, and mental abuse against me and my siblings. My parents pretty much watched him destroy us, as they felt it was normal under his supposed ‚ÄúAsperger‚Äôs‚Äù diagnosis. Talking to my multiple psychiatrists I‚Äôve had over the years, nearly every single one has said that he legitimately sounds sociopathic.   Anyway, among my various hospitalizations (there are a lot) many professionals have gaslit new into thinking certain things. As, apparently, sexual assault by a woman is impossible, they convinced me that a man had done something to me. It‚Äôs all a bit foggy, as, when these things were hammered into my brain, I was having a psychotic episode.   I‚Äôve always been terrified of the fact that my eldest brother did something to me unspeakable. After years of having night terrors of being raped and touched by priests + famous people, I finally dreamt about someone I know. My brother. My life is a living hell. I need to move out. I need to move out. I‚Äôm working really hard to graduate a year early. I hate this. I know my parents would have let that happen to me. They left me alone with him so many times, always drilling me ‚ÄúIf he hurts you, call 911.‚Äù I‚Äôm scared of living here.   On top of all that, I accidentally came out to my parents as bi (It‚Äôs too raw to go into details), and they weren‚Äôt accepting. It‚Äôs hard to discredit them, as they talk so reasonably. If they were screeching and yelling at me, trying to disown me, it would be easy to write them off as batshit crazy. Instead they chalked it up to a defect due to trauma, and that they still love me ‚Äúdespite all my flaws‚Äù. It hurts to know that it‚Äôs all just a deformity to them. I want to be good. I‚Äôve acknowledged that I‚Äôll never have their approval in marrying someone my same sex, which will probably lead me to never marrying at all (as that‚Äôs who I‚Äôm primarily attracted to).   In attempts to hide these feelings and push them away, I lost the only friend I ever had (this was well over a year ago). She had a crush on me, and I cut her off. Partially due to trauma, yes, but also because I was terrified to like her back. I missed out so much. She was kind and cute. She, too, had sexual trauma. We would have been the gentlest with each other. I could‚Äôve had a girlfriend who loved and cherished me. Instead I got emptiness and loneliness. The last text that I received (excluding of my family) was from a girl who just wanted help with homework... in April.  I‚Äôm lonely and don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever find love, due to both religious and sexual trauma.   I don‚Äôt want to kill myself (so maybe posting here is a waste of time). I‚Äôm so excited for my future. I want to be an aerospace engineer. I want to make friends. I want to meet a lovely person one day to marry (which is kind of a slim chance at this point).

I have now been given a new diagnosis and I feel that this one is correct I have looked through all the symptoms and also got a third party, who I live with to look up the symptoms and they said it describes me perfectly and I agree, my new diagnosis are EUPD (Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder) which is a form of BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) finally now I might get some answers and my game plan for my therapy sessions going forward in this order is: 1. Learn coping techniques for when i feel like self harming or wanting to die 2. Learn how to show emotion as I find it had to show anything apart from happy or angry 3. Talk through my past experiences with the therapist as that has defiantly had a negotiable effect on me and I feel a lot of guilt about the things I‚Äôve done 4.

I kinda forgave her and we discussed it a Lot so she told me she will stop talking to him etc... 2weeks ago I got really ill i was in hospital for 1 day and the next day after hospital she told me she wants to leave me coz she doesnt feel the same way to me and she wants to be free and to not have a relationship. I was devastated but what could I do. Since the last 2 weeks i lost 14pounds. That same day she went to his house they got drunk and I found out instantly through her brother. I didnt tell her i knew, because when she got home she messaged me how much she loves me but love isnt everything, but then admitted she was with him but told me they only kissed etc... We met the next day and she told me she loved me and will never love anyone like me but cant be together with me coz she still cant go through the thing I had more girls and she had only me.. We were always the kind of be together forever couple. She told me that we can still be friends but cant be together coz she doesnt want to hurt me ever. She hasnt met the guy since then, so I decided to meet her again myself and talk to her. She always told me she would never give a BJ to any other guy without relationship, because she knows it would TOTALLY break my heart and my whole life (i knew that one day it would happen, but still) she told me she would never ever do it immediately, but she confessed to me, that she did suck His dick the same day I was very ill and she broke up with me, but she totally disliked it.  I know i cant be with her anymore, but how does one manage this much pain? i was crying and vommiting for 2 hours straight and I just know I will never ever trust anyone else anymore.",indicator

I started relating to villains first, like manga , movie , Comic or show villains who have suffered. I started to understand why they do what they do.   And i want to do the same. The only way i can repair my broken world is by fueling it with other peoples suffering.

So I had the girl of my dreams, everything I could've ever asked for... And I emotionally/mentally abused her. She has a history of very abusive boyfriends (everything from rape, to being beaten, to mental bullying) and uses drugs to escape her misery and pain... and I promised her I would never hurt her. I promised her I would be so much better than her exes. And I fucking failed her.  (a little context before I continue, we were long distance but not extremely so. She's in Ohio, I'm in Illinois.)  What did I do, you ask? Rape her? Beat her? No, I would never lay a hand on a woman like that. I was raised to respect women and even took a little while to get comfortable being sexual with her out of fear of being disrespectful...   But that's besides the point. What I did was harass her. Whenever we'd have a fight (as all couples inevitably do), she'd try to walk away from it to cool down. She hates confrontation and wants to avoid stress and drama. What did my piece of shit worthless self do? I fucking spammed her with calls on messenger, skype, over phone, you name it. For whatever reason my stubborn ass just couldn't leave things be for at times. And when she'd block my accounts, I just made more and kept harassing her to talk to me. I once even threatened suicide if she didn't talk to me.  My biggest problems in the relationship were 1) I'm co-dependant. 2) I got overly upset over little stuff (not violently so, I'm not a violent person). And 3) Harassing her when she didn't want to talk. Our first break up was October 30th, last year. Yep, Halloween. I sure didn't get a treat this year, that's for sure!   Hahaha ^^^kill ^^^me  She relapsed and started doing drugs again immediately after the breakup, and had been clean since before we had gotten together, and I still blame myself for that. I begged and pleaded with her for another chance. I promised I could be better. She waited a few weeks to see if I would actually make an effort to be better, and I did make some progress, but then started getting worse again eventually. She then broke up with me for the second time back in February, and I tried to kill myself for the first time in my life (and didn't even come close because I'm an idiot). After a few weeks, we had started talking again in early March. We both still loved each other, still were sweet with each other, basically we treated each other as if we were together but we never officially got back together. A few weeks ago... I got overly upset over some really little things, and I think that was the straw that broke the camels back.   One night a couple weeks ago, she told me she no longer loved me. She said she'd rather die than ever be with me again, and called me a psycho. There are very few times in my life that I will ever be that devastated... Over the past couple weeks, I kept harassing her, begging for another chance,... But I've just been making it worse. The past few days, it got to a point where my ex's ""best friend"" started sending me really toxic. And hateful messages, basically mocking my mental illness and suicidal tendencies. Some of the shit she said to me could drive a more unstable person to suicide... She also tried scaring me with threats about lawyers and similar bs (that was days ago, and she claimed I'd be hearing from them in a couple of days).  Yesterday around noon, she spent around 2 hours just fucking mocking me. I wasn't even being rude to her, I was legitimately trying to be nice, but she already made her judgement on me based on whatever my ex told her. The friend even said that my ex would be better off with her previous ex (who beat her, raped her bullied her into sex, cheated on her, etc.). Basically just kicking me while I'm down, not that I didn't deserve it.   Just a few hours ago...me and my ex talked over voice for the first time in weeks, and of course everything that's happened in the past week cane up... I have never felt like such a piece of shit in my life. It was killing me inside, hearing the pain and misery in her voice. I legitimately wanted to die, as she told me about the breakdowns she was having the other day because of me. Apparently her friend was scared she was going to kill herself... I have been laying here, crying the last few hours. I can't believe I did that to her, I can't believe I put her through that, I can't believe I hurt her so much after I promised I wouldn't. I actually feel like the worst person in the world right now because I hurt the person I love more than life itself so much.... I really just want to die right now and do the world the favor of finding myself. (un)fortunately, I don't have access to a quick and painless way to do it, so I just cut myself for the first time since the February breakup. And I'm sitting here dishing I had been better, wishing I could have just one more chance to be with her, to redeem myself... But won't get one. I blew it. I had the girl of my dreams at a dark time of my life, and I blew it. I'd give anything to have her love again. I was lucky I even earned it in the first place.  The other day, my ex said it would be great if we could just be best friends. When I asked her if maybe we could try again one day of I bettered myself, she said possibly but that she couldn't make any promises. Earlier tonight, she had me make two promises, 1) Not to harass her anymore. And 2) To not ask her for another chance ever again... I think making that second promise actually killed me a little inside. But I don't want her out of my life, I loved and care about her with all my heart, so I made it.  So as of right now, we're ""best friends"", though I wish and yearn to be more again, my heart aches for it. Though in her voice earlier it sounded almost like hatred, though that could've been just her getting emotional while going over the breakdowns I've caused her. Eventually she said she had to go because her phones better was dying, and I asked her what about her laptop and she seemed to have come up with an excuse on the spot. So I said bye, crying, while apologizing for everything and telling her I love her. She seemed still upset with me and hasn't answered my texts since. She's a night person, so she's normally up around this time. I could just be overthinking things, Idk. I do have the tendency to do that.  I just feel like the worst person on earth, I feel so heartbroken, so guilty, so regretful. I wish I could turn back time and fix my mistakes, but all I can do is try to learn from them.... But that don't get me the girl of my dreams back :(  So this is where I'm at now. In the middle of the night, emotional, cut myself, wanting to die, being socially inept, having little to no friends, wishing I had been better, feeling like a grade A piece of shit, and I've essentially been friendzoned by the woman I love. Life is fucking fantastic!   For what it's worth, I never did anything wanted to hurt her, and I did do a lot of good for her. She left her extremely abusive boyfriend she was with for years, to be with me, some loser she met on the internet. She had little to no self esteem, because of other people, and I helped boost it immensly by assuring her of how powerful and amazing she is. I always loved her unconditionally and always did my best to make her feel loved and appreciated. And I once stopped her from killing herself. She was actually planning on ODing on heroin one night, and I was able to talk her out of it and convince her this world would not be better off without her. I've never been more scared in my life than I was that night, begging and pleading with the woman I loved not to kill herself... So yeah, I wasn't all bad, but I sure feel as bad as can be :(  If I could have any one wish, I wouldn't hesitate. I'd give anything to earn her love again.

Both groups are capable of gulping too many pills, but I‚Äôm wondering to what degree we‚Äôre observing very different situations.   An 11 years old who wants to ‚Äúkill herself‚Äù is in pain. The pain is overwhelming and her experience doesn‚Äôt give her ways to find relief. There may not be relief. In any case, her focus on the pain of the moment makes the potential of a good future completely disappear from her option. So, ok, let‚Äôs tell her that we love her and try change her mind.  But a 50 years old is an adult. She went through multiple experiences, the death of her parents, the birth of her son, a good job, a good friendship, an abusive boss, a betrayal. The 50 years old knows what she‚Äôs feeling, she‚Äôs less likely influenced by a road rage episode from that morning. If she wants to die, she must know what she‚Äôs saying.  If we really want to help, our attitude to responding to these two profiles must be very different. We could use white lies with the former, but we don‚Äôt want to say bullsh*t to the latter and further destroy her already crumbling faith in humanity.  However, most of times, support comes only in the first form, like we were all 11 years old. Are we sure we‚Äôre not making more damage than benefit? Personally, with the second category, I believe that empathising is more useful than trying to change their mind.

730,"I honestly can‚Äôt imagine liking my appearance (long vent) I never liked myself or thought I was pretty even when I was little. Back then I was mostly just indifferent to the way I looked, like I didn‚Äôt hate my appearance but I definitely didn‚Äôt love it. I do remember hating all my school pictures, and whenever I had to see my most recent one I‚Äôd look away because I disliked looking at myself. This was back when I was in about third grade I think.  Looking back, I don‚Äôt think I was pretty as a kid despite when people say. My family thinks I was a gorgeous baby and kid, but I really don‚Äôt see it. When I was in fifth grade there was a slideshow of all the kids in the grades‚Äô baby, kindgarten and current pictures at elementary school graduation, and I remember wincing when mine can up. I was ashamed that everyone had to see me as an ugly little kid.  As I‚Äôm writing this I realize how awful it sounds. Maybe there‚Äôs just no such thing as a good picture of me, but either way I‚Äôm not made for photos. Even when I was little I wasn‚Äôt.  I really don‚Äôt know how other people can look at themselves in the mirror and not hate what they see. I‚Äôm happy they all don‚Äôt have to go through what I do. Saying this makes me feel incredibly awful, because I‚Äôm not covered in scars (on my face or other easily visible body parts at least) and don‚Äôt have any disfigurements or anything. I just hate my skin, my face, my everything.  Everyday when I wake up and look in the mirror I can‚Äôt help but think about how unattractive I am. I constantly think about how no one would ever want me and how I‚Äôll never date anyone for several reasons, one of them being how much I dislike myself and my appearance. I think I‚Äôd be unfair to a potential boyfriend to have to date someone who hates themselves as much as I do, and that‚Äôs assuming someone would actually like me.  Two boys have liked me in the past, one in ninth grade and one a few weeks ago at a psych hospital. The one from ninth grade told me he liked me but not just because I was pretty, but for other reasons I forgot about. He was overall scary and extremely manipulative, so I took that with a grain of salt. The psych hospital guy was really nice and when I mentioned how unattractive I thought I was, he said that all the boys in the room would disagree. He ended up being manipulative as well and was scary too, and I‚Äôm never seeing him again anyways so I disregarded that statement.  I just don‚Äôt believe it when people call me pretty. I know that when you like a person they look more attractive to you and when you dislike someone they look uglier to you, so when my friends say how pretty I am I just remember that and think that must be the reason. Or they‚Äôre just being nice.  I know I‚Äôll never date anyone for a lot of reasons, like because I‚Äôm scared of boys/men, hate myself and how I look, have trauma, and am asexual and afraid of sex in general.

When I was in elementary school I used to constantly wish I had never been born. I was convinced I'd kill myself by the time I was 16. Obviously, that didn't happen.  I've had ups and downs in my life, I had a period of maybe two years in college where I actually genuinely felt GOOD about my life and where it was headed. Then my depression and anxiety got worse again. Spent a week in a behavioral hospital. Got on meds. They took the edge off but I never got back to that positive space. I wasn't miserable though, so they did their job.  Fast forward to last year, my dad killed himself in February. It came out of nowhere. Not gonna get deep into it, but we never had a great relationship until we reconnected around 2018. It pretty much wrecked me. I'm still not ""over it."" I can't even handle thinking about him.  Literally the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my mom. She has no other family and it would destroy her if I died, especially in that way. I will not do that to her. But, as it stands right now, I'm going to kill myself when she's gone. I've never admitted that to anyone but I need to get it off my chest.

781,"(TW) Suicide is sometimes rational, and I'm trying to honestly figure out if that's where I'm at I'm 22, I've been homeless and fleeing domestic violence for most of my adult life with severe chronic PTSD, eating disorders that I'm statistically pretty likely to die from before 30 and depressive-psychotic episodes which often come at the worst times and put me in increased danger or can cause me to (accidentally) hurt anyone who cared enough to stick around. I wake up most days at 4 am re-experiencing rape, and my day usually gets worse from there on out. I've tried EVERY treatment I could access, from years of hospitalizations (10+, mostly voluntary and ALL of them made it much worse) and way more medication than any person should take, to off the books treatments and therapists, psycho-analysis, massage, acupuncture and Chinese herbs, other herbs, self-medicating with fun herbs, seeing dieticians and nutritionists and holistic life couches, DBT, CBT, ACT, EMDR, all kinds of groups and programs, live-in programs, eating disorder residentials, endless outpatient clinics, case management, peer support, even psychedelic therapy, getting an emotional support animal, skydiving, learning to play the harp, traveling the continent multiple times and trying to create my own hospital alternatives.  I've literally done everything I have the power to do to try and recover inside and outside of the system, and most of these things haven't made a considerable difference or have actually made it actively worse (meds lol). No matter the case, I don't have the resources to keep trying and I just don't have the energy anymore either.    My life ending early is likely to be unavoidable anyway, and continuing to live this miserably when I know it's likely for nothing (that I'll never get to recover, feel lasting happiness or maintain healthy relationships), feels cruel to me, especially when I can't stay alive without re-experiencing severe trauma near-daily and putting myself at real risk to repeat that trauma regularly. I've come to think of myself as someone who might be granted ethical assisted suicide if that existed in this country for mental health concerns, despite my age.      So, I'm here writing this mostly, simply, because I don't have any person in my life I can tell this to (except, actually, my mom, who agrees with me and supports my decision to end my life). But I want to know if other people agree this is reasonable or not. It wouldn't necessarily change my mind, but I am trying to do the most rational thing and at this moment my mind is still kind of open.

I‚Äôm chronically ill with, what my doctors call, a severe case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. All of my joints dislocate on a daily basis, sitting too long will cause fabrics to rip into my skin, standing up makes me blackout instantly and I hit my head regularly because of this, I can no longer walk and use a wheelchair to get around, I have a problem with literally all of my organs from this, and I‚Äôm constantly in pain. There is no cure for this shitty disease I was born with. As of this year, I can‚Äôt drive anymore without vomiting or falling asleep.   Since it‚Äôs gotten worse this past year, I‚Äôve been struggling in school. Since I have accommodations through my university‚Äôs Accessibility Resources, I have excused medical absences and no late penalty for assignments. However, all of my professors tell me to drop out since I haven‚Äôt been able to attend the last two weeks. Even before I got worse recently, they always keep trying to ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with me‚Äù and I‚Äôm not comfortable sharing that with them and it‚Äôs incredibly awkward. Additionally, they‚Äôd always call me out in class and say shit like ‚ÄúI know this makes you uncomfortable, [name],‚Äù or ‚ÄúWould this work for you? I know you can‚Äôt walk.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre actually trying to be helpful but they make me feel singled out in front of 30+ people. One professor even keeps trying to meet me outside of class to talk about my ‚Äúmedical issues.‚Äù Accessibility Resources is in the midst of dealing with all of those problems, since I can‚Äôt deal with this anymore myself but it‚Äôs going nowhere.   I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Major Depressive disorder with psychotic features. Another doctor says I‚Äôm probably autistic on top of that but I can‚Äôt afford testing, since my insurance generally only covers 1% for procedures. They covered $17 of my brother‚Äôs $15k sleep study. I see psychiatrists, therapists, rheumatologist, occupational and physical therapists, cardiologists, gastroenterologist, a connective tissue clinic, and neurologists. I‚Äôve been seeing these people, from three different hospitals, for years now. I‚Äôm just not getting better.   I‚Äôm going to have to drop out of college since I can‚Äôt get to my classes or do any of the work. I have to quit my job because I can‚Äôt get to work. However, this job is waiting to fully hire me (with benefits and better health insurance) when I get my degree, since I‚Äôm two semesters away from graduating. But I‚Äôm throwing that all away since I literally can‚Äôt leave my bed.   I‚Äôve always been suicidal since I was ten and was constantly in and out of psych inpatient units. Since 2010, I‚Äôve tried to kill myself 20 times. The last time I was in an inpatient unit (last year), one of the male nurses pressed his erection into my back, and I can barely go into hospitals anymore because I‚Äôm just terrified of male doctors and nurses now.   I‚Äôm on ten different medications for a myriad of reasons and none work as intended.   I don‚Äôt have any friends, at work or from school, so I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to or get help from. I lost all of my friends within the last year because they‚Äôre ‚Äútired of being friends with someone as disabled as [me].‚Äù   Last time I called 911 for assistance, they tried to put me in an inpatient unit, but chose not to after explaining what happened last time and that I‚Äôm actively seeing doctors on a weekly basis.   I‚Äôm at a loss and feel permanently stuck.   When I drop out, I‚Äôll lose all of my scholarships and grants and won‚Äôt be able to even do part time. So college is pretty much over for me, even though it was my favorite thing to do.   I don‚Äôt plan on living much longer. I‚Äôm done. I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. I‚Äôm so emotionally, physically, and academically exhausted. I‚Äôm truly not meant to live normally in this world and I‚Äôm tired of trying.

I'm 27 never had a job because my anxiety and me feeling clueless about how the world works has held me back. My mom had a heart attack april 2020, she constantly bitches at me about how useless I am, and brought me down so much that I have 0 confidence.

I have a hard time taking care of myself. I don't even know how to make appointments for myself. I hate company when they come over now and can't stand being around people. I have panic attacks. At 27 I should have my life partially figured out but I don't. The only accomplishment I have was from 2013. I watch my siblings all stepping ahead in life. My parents are divorced, we live with my brother. I feel like I don't belong here because my mom says if it weren't for them I'd be homeless and no one would take me in if it wasn't for them. I don't feel good about myself. I don't even feel attractive anymore. My mom always worries me, yells at me, puts me down,  says she's going to die soon within 8 years.  I feel like shit because I don't want that to happen and feel like if she does I'll be at fault, I want to kill myself because of her. She says I add nothing but stress to her life, and pretty much begs me to get out there and as stupid as it sounds I can't and won't. I am not normal, so please don't judge me. I don't need to hear that because I know. I just want to know if anyone else in my situation so I don't feel alone. At the same time. I wasn't always like this. I used to go out. Didn't suffer anxiety as bad and didn't have agoraphobia, or scared of company, but my family put me down a lot and bullied, made me feel unloved  in the past, it still happens today. but they don't see any issue in their behavior. My mom gaslit me a lot whenever I open up about how I feel.  I get intrusive thoughts where I feel like killing myself is best option because I won't suffer anymore and I won't be a burden to others. I don't want to live in regret and I feel like my mom did enough damage to me, when she dies it will be my fault and I know it's going to be in my head that I could have tried harder for her but didn't.

935,"I feel like part of the acceptance stage (final step in stage of grief) should be admittance to want of death IDK if this is the right sub. to post this but its one of the few that I think will actually accept a post like this and something I need to get off my chest.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, I'm 23 years old and have Aspergers (high functioning Autism). When I went to college (started ""real life"") is really where my life started to fall apart. In general, from speaking to others this is a pretty common occurence for most people on the spectrum and other developmental disorders as such.   &amp;#x200B;  In realizing how much it impacted me, I certainly went through the stages of grief. Now I feel I'm at the phase of acceptance in that I realize that there's no magic cure and its something I'll have to live with. That being said, I don't side with the general Aspie community it seems with the opinion that the development of pre-natal scanning for Autism for aborting is obscene and wrong. Not only that, but I strongly encourage it. I don't think it should be required to abort them but I do certainly think that REAL education of what its like raising a kid with Aspergers/Autism is like as well as the obstacles they face.   &amp;#x200B;  At the end of the day, there are VERY few parents who I think can properly and effectively parent a child with it. I even tell my parents that I think you're good parents but not good parents for me (AKA somebody with Autism/Aspergers) but that I don't blame them for it because it shouldn't be expected of them. I don't think the parents should be stigmatized for it but at the same time its not fair to the kid.  &amp;#x200B;  Not to mention the world in general is admittedly not structured for those on the spectrum. I guess you could argue that its possible for some to adapt but at the end of the day I don't really see the point of knowingly having a child who you know ahead of time is going to immensely struggle to blend in society (hence why I encourage abortion in most cases).   &amp;#x200B;  A commonly asked question I see is why do we only ever see children with developmental conditions advertised/in media. At the end of the day, its because adulthood is almost always bleak. ""Institutions"" are still a VERY real thing. Lower functioning Autism, Down Syndrome, mentally retarded, etc. kids are still very much sent off when their parents no longer can/feel like taking care of them. I know the common belief in society is that the handling of mental illness until recently was very poor and everybody was just institutionalized, well, its the same thing now. The only difference is that they can live their childhood at home and with their peers before being sent off.   &amp;#x200B;  Conditions like Aspergers aren't much less bleak. Most are able enough to not be sent to an institution but most companies outright refuse to hire those on the spectrum, the unemployment rate is ridiculously high, many jobs require skills Aspies don't naturally have. Most end up in poorly paid jobs reserved for those with ""disabilities"" or doing something else of little respect. I'm actually personally looking into doing sex work.  &amp;#x200B;  I certainly don't see myself committing suicide at this point (although if assisted suicide becomes available I would take it). Although I think a real part of accepting my condition is realizing that I'm not all that special and can now more clearly see and accept the fact that Aspergers/Autism just doesn't work. I will say that one benefit (there aren't many) is I do think I'm a bit less judgemental after realizing how Aspergers/Autism impacts me. I can now more clearly see that jobs like sex work are no less respectable than any other company and have more respect for those workers and realizing that there's no shame in what they're doing.",ideation

Hi, first of all I don't mean to hurt, offense, belittle anyone with this question. I'm just really wondering... and want to have a deeper understanding on this topic.  So, instead of all general data and content from the internet, I'm genuinely looking for experiences/stories of real people who are willing to (shortly) share personal experiences concerning 'h*nging'.

Let me preface this by saying I have battled depression from a very young age, around 8 I suffered many losses of friends and family. I just turned 24 so its been 16 years and, I have fought and fought for a very long time. Even as a small child my parents told me that I would say things like ‚ÄúI want to go home to my real family.‚Äù and ‚ÄúThat I didn‚Äôt belong here‚Äù This would freak them and other out as a 4-5 year old would talk about being tired of life already and wanting to see his real family. I have lived my entire life homesick. Im tired. Not the kind of exhaustion I once felt where I just wanted to sleep, but one that I feel in my very being. Sleep was once a respite but now it‚Äôs just as bad if not worse than being awake. It use to come in waves but for the past few years it‚Äôs been ever constant, I don‚Äôt even have a moment to catch my breath. Just being wears me out anymore, I find no joy in anything, hell I barely feel anything anymore, almost everything that once brought me joy feels like a chore. Writing is one of my last few joys in this world so here I am writing. I have done many things to try to combat the depression and suicidal thoughts. Ive gone to therapy, tried different medications, psychadelics, meditation, dropping everything and moving away to start over, changing professions, going back to school, surrounding myself with happier people, etc, etc. Im currently on my last leg, I‚Äôm trying some more natural remedies, more natural suppliments, helping others again as that always seemed to at least ease my suffering even if only by a small amount. Ive tried to adhere to the buddhist teachings that if I ease the suffering of others I will ease my own.       The intent of this isn‚Äôt to be a suicide note, but if you find this and I have in-fact killed myself at this point, I hope this might provide some insight into why. Im writing this for myself not for anyone else, I‚Äôm hoping writing it out will let me work through some of my issues.

I feel as though I‚Äôm little more than an imposter and that they either don‚Äôt like me and are faking it, or that they don‚Äôt even really know me and care about little more than a facade. Logically I know that there are people who at the very least SEEM to love me. Family and friends tell me they‚Äôd miss me, but in all honesty I am hitting the point where I no longer care. They tell me I‚Äôm being selfish, but aren‚Äôt they being selfish by trying to make me stay here and suffer. When I‚Äôve done psychadelics such as DMT I swear on everything that I‚Äôve seen my real family, and that I know they‚Äôre waiting for me. It‚Äôs not that they want me to kill myself, they want to see me live a good life, the want me to succeed and be happy. But I truly believe I have seen what Is waiting for us on the other side and it is so much more beautiful than anything you could imagine. The only time I‚Äôve ever felt true unconditional love was with them.     I feel like little more than a burden to those around me. I had to move back in with my parents recently thank to losing my job and covid. And I feel like I‚Äôm just a little bitch who can‚Äôt even stand on his own right now.       I have several mental illnesses; depression, anxiety, ADHD, OCD, and these all make doing things more and more difficult to do. I know there are people out there that cope with these and to those I‚Äôm SO proud of you. Ive tried a multitude of treatments, every single one has let me feel better for a couple of weeks and then my symptoms get worse. Im more apathetic and nihilistic than I‚Äôve ever been in my enter life. I used to exercise very day, and this helped, but after an accident in which I broke both my legs, I‚Äôve been unable to even get started back. I can‚Äôt even motivate myself to go out for a fucking walk. Honestly it feels like the only thing that has kept me from shooting myself Is the fact id have to go into another room unlock my safe and drive off to shoot myself so that my parents won‚Äôt find my corpse in their house. Im literally to unmotivated to even kill myself right now.  Even in rare moments of bliss I always think, man i should just end it on a high note.  I don‚Äôt want to sit here and play the victim, and I‚Äôm sorry if this comes off like I‚Äôm throwing myself a pity party. I just need to vent and get this out, some people in my life know bits and pieces, but I can‚Äôt imagine telling anyone I know all of it, I‚Äôm worried they would just have me committed and I REALLY don‚Äôt want that. A few people have said they‚Äôd be sad if I do kill myself but they‚Äôd understand as they‚Äôve watched me suffer for years. I honestly don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm posting this I don‚Äôt know what I hope to achieve from it. Maybe just a release of some of these emotions I‚Äôve been bottling up.  All in all ive seen enough death in my life to know just how inconsequential I am.  Ive seen how my family and most people react to death, They might be sad for a few months, maybe a year or two, but then life happens.  You slowly forget about them, new people enter your life, you become too busy to focus on what once was.  You might remember them on their Bday or around the time they died,  but all in all you move on after a couple of decades i doubt anyone would even really remember me.",behavior

Yep feelings, something I despise since young since they put logic aside and make you act on your immediate needs? I guess so, they can bring you down, up and away. But anyway I uh don‚Äôt know anymore, I guess I fell subject to them. Subject to being addicted to a single person.   Is that love? Probably, but she was the oonly who would give me anttention and compassion. Nobody else really could give me that, since most people just didn‚Äôt care enough or didn‚Äôt know enough to feel relatable. I mean to be fair, she only had a small disorder but I guess she has had her share of rough times. Something we can both relate to. But what is it really that drive these emotion for socializing.   I‚Äôm here, alone, as usual feeling shit because I have nobody to talk to, or anyone that I can just feel free with to be honest. I don‚Äôt know how to put it, its just, that I never ever felt I could be this open with somebody before. I would just share my insides to her and she would accept it? I don‚Äôt know how to say it, she was the only one to care for me and go beyond a certain extend to do it I guess :/.   But what is really happening with me? Why am I depressed? Why do I have to have these disorders for fucks sake. Why can I not go back to 2 years ago where I was a happy person, alone but I didn‚Äôt care at all for going out. Why do I have to have touched this socializing part of me and not be just productive? Why do I have to involve myself into group affairs into social groups which are no more because of some, drama‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶   An environment, I used to be in, surrounded with happy friends and people around me.

I haven't fucking talked to any of my friends for a solid 2 weeks now with the exception of a girl who's arguably my best friend at this point. She was feeling sad because secretly she hooked up with another guy in our friend group after they've been talking for a while and now he told he doesn't really feel well with going through with the relationship because he's not feeling mentally there as well. I comforted her and everything went fine and all, and it really sort of grounded me from all these depressive thoughts I'm having.   Anyway, I'm a 19 year old dude who know nothing about fucking anything. Lol never thought I'd be typing that. I'm barely 5'7 with a good face and build and all, but my hair has been falling since 17 and my mental has been spiraling down the fucking drain since I found out via two assholes I used to be friends with teasing me about it on a camping trip. Obviously it's gotten worse and Idk wtf to do. nice segway, because another major issue I'm fucking dealing with is not knowing what TO DO. AT ALL. I'm 19, everyone's going to University here, and even though I got offers, I'm not sure I want to go into debt here in Canada for something I'm not entirely sure about/interested in. Now that's normal but it's so fucking hopeless. Nobody can tell me what to do or what to feel and they're all tired of it because it's all I bring up whenever they ask me if I'm alright or how I'm doing. Always the same shit. I'm rotting away.   I've never experienced anything. I'm just 19 but I already feel old as if my time has already passed. To maintain morale in high school, I just gamed, really. Never dated, never had any girls interested and it's not getting any better now since I'm out of school and deciding if I wanna go to Uni next year or not. My only option is goddamn tinder, as if I'm gonna have any luck there, as a short guy that's also balding for no reason whatsoever. I've never even gotten laid one time while all of my friends have basically. I just don't think I'm cut out for this.   I want to live, I really do but I can't. I don't know how to proceed, all I know is that I wanna have some sort of artistic legacy and I wanna be good at something. I've picked up a guitar but idk how to learn it myself. Meanwhile my physical prime is already ending whereas everyone else's is just starting. I'm short, balding and even though I go to the gym, I'm still alone and feeling more secluded every day as I sit inside with nothing to do except play games and think. It's just so fucking hard dealing with all this shit at this age when everyone else is too busy worrying about girls and whether or not to get shitfaced while I'm worrying about the sad reality that all of this shit I want to experience isn't coming for me.

He would golfer so close and try to get me to follow him to secluded areas. I felt so disgusting.   Then 8th grade rolled around. Everything was good and I felt happy. It started with my body.

Can't find a partner, can't have kids the natural right way. I would do anything to take this away from me, to never feel it again. I can't even look at attractive women anymore. Don't tell me that I will find someone. That is statistically very unlikely. Dont tell me all this bullshit, because its not fucking true.   I tell everyone that I never want these things but I do. I always say I never want children or a relationship but I say it because I *know* ill never have those things.   Death is the only solution. I cannot live this way anymore. Everyday is just hurt, sadness and anger. No matter how hard I try to change, it is hard-wired in my brain. I just cannot deal with it anymore.",ideation

1069,Some of thoughts I‚Äôve been having jumbled together I wrote my first suicide note when I was 7 I‚Äôve tried to kill myself 6 times in the last 2 years I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me I‚Äôve talked to my therapist about wanting to kill myself. But I haven‚Äôt told him that I‚Äôve actually tried. One of the reasons I think I haven‚Äôt been able to go through it is because I still love my family. Another reason being I‚Äôm sacred of what happens after. If I knew that my family would be fine I don‚Äôt think I would be scared any more but it‚Äôs the thought of not knowing which scares me. It‚Äôs the thought that I‚Äôll hurt them and I won‚Äôt be able to tell them how sorry I and fix the damage I‚Äôve caused . Another one of the few reasons I‚Äôm still here is when my depression and anxiety get Worse I would always promise my self just a few more years then it‚Äôll get better just a few more just keep them happy a few mores years.

I don't know how people can be so cruel at times, there's honestly no true love (maybe few exceptions). I don't feel alive, high always puts me in bad trip where I just cry myself to sleep, work is fun but I don't wanna be a machine learning new things and just working my ass off, also I've tried hitting Gym, etc.. but nothing makes me feel myself anymore. It's like a soul less body working and surviving one more day at a time.  I'm not going to keep doing this, I don't wanna live this way, it's so lifeless.

I probably even won't kill me but it's worth a shot cause honestly I know what happens if I continue living it's more and more misery and the end I die from old age or cancer or something similar anyways. I might as well end it before it gets even worse. Yes, I know people care but I don't care anymore cause I feel alone and none of them get it or support me in ways I need. I hate myself and people. I have nothing to live for, plus everyone in society as a bad thing it's not that bad. What's bad is that society made people think that I have to end myself to leave this hell. That's what the bad thing not suicide itself. The only reason I probably haven't commited suicide is I have no idea is a afterlife is a thing and I would rather know if it was before I die but sadly no one really knows. So I guess, I'll take a chance that I won't become nothing.. and even if I do it's not like I wasn't that when I was alive.. Either way fuck trying or surviving anymore.. I have been doing that for too long and I'm done and exhausted of doing it of that..

Maybe what actually needs to happen is that someone needs someone to be more understanding and just listen and then people wouldn't be thinking so much about thier negative experiences with people.

[[Age ~ Highschool Level.]]  [[Diagnosis ~ ADD ~ When Angered, I Can't think of my actions.]]  [[Feelings ~ Loneliness, Depression, Lack of confidence and a crisis of faith.]]  Anyways, Now to talk.  I'm Just here to say that I Can't deal with the amount of internet/Real life embarrassment and neglect anymore, in this post, I'll discuss my problems, Situations and thoughts about them.  I started using the internet in 2016, Beginning with ""Instagram"", Because everyone else was using it, I'd figure it would be a good way to make some friends and socialize with people at my school, So I Decided to put up my art project as my first post there, Around October 10-21st of that year.  During this period, I had extreme amounts of people teasing me because of my art, My Personal struggles and humiliate me based on what I Like and don't like, This was not 2-4 People, This was around 90 Different people all at once harassing me one by one, It put me in tears and I Had to abandon the account for 5 Years and counting.  The School board did not do anything about this, The Parents did nothing about this, Literally nobody cared, In fact, This has ruined my school life further because right after I Quit The App, I've been put into 1v1 Teaching classes, And never spoke to another classmate, or student, or anyone else, From Gr5 until Gr8, Around 2019.  Grade 8 and 9 were ok, But People were constantly talking behind my back, And I Had an assistant teacher watch me like a hawk during those periods, Because of That, I'd be called ""Teachers pet"" for the rest of middle school, Further   High school is a lot worse, Because you got students with pocket knifes and the teaching is more corrupted, All my courses were just an infliction of pain every time I Attend them, I'll label them.  [ Design ] - All you do is rub sandpaper on wood, Since I'm sensitive to sharp things and frequently rub my eyes, It's painful to get it through and deal with a passing mark while not having scars and cuts.  [ Gym ] - Sports is fun, But not the way this class is, The Crowd there harasses me, Steals my lunch, Interrupts tests, And never let's me on a team during sports, The Teacher refuses to give me a good mark despite me passing all the paperwork, And now that I Have failed, I Would have to attend my summer in school during a pandemic doing the thing I'm not built for.  [ Math ] - Constant pressure from this course makes my life at home never relaxing, Everyday, I have a boatload of work to do in school and home, And since I Have back pains when I'm home, This makes this class a lot more harder than it needs to be, Classmates aren't any better.  [ English ] - Always disrupted during work, Inuit language is nearly impossible to identify quickly without a lot of work, Painful seat, And a rat hole near my desk, Combined with Math, Is literal hell.  All of this is made worse with one flaw, Nobody knows that I Even exist, Whenever I Ask a question, Try to talk, Or even do something good, They all ignore me.  The thing that nails my depression to the very core, is my reddit reputation, It's a long story, But I'll explain it.   I have began looking for a social media app to replace Instagram so that I could post my work and show people that I am talented and that I have some good qualities, So I Wouldn't be deemed as a ""No-Life"" to my classmates, I Wanted to be popular on that app and show my classmates that I can be as good as them.  Then, as you know it, I discovered reddit, Started an account, And started some posts about the xbox 360, Which was short lived, As I Went on to the Fortnite Sub to keep up with the times, And that's where things started to go wrong.  There was one post about a ""CheerLeader"" concept, I Personally found it disgusting, and way too sexualized for the game, I Posted a comment on it, saying that, and then, Controversy arose.  There was a subreddit that criticizes the ""Stupidity"" of fortnite users on reddit, And they put my comment on there, I seen people call me even more names and insulted my previous posts (Drawings.), At that point, I Had enough of how I'm treated, And Have step foot on that post, and Have put down my opinion on them, And criticized the idea of a subreddit bashing opinions.  And then, Well, I have been hated, Very, Very, Hated, On the site, People started Dm'ing me daily insulting me, and the previous posts I Had were now being attacked for how I view things, Once I Started insulting the people Dm'ing me insults back, The controversy grew even more, And Now, I'm deemed racist, Just for not agreeing with them. ( Nobody won't agree to ""Go Kill yourself"" nicely. )  I'd tried to ignore the criticism, But it still would constantly appear, Blocking, Being Polite and Improving my posts still didn't help my situation.  I Then Created a subreddit for my art projects so that I Can Control my criticism, and to let things die down, But unfortunately, They grew even more, Supposedly, A User wanted to be a friend and felt bad about my situation, But it later turned to be a diversion when I Let him help me with my subreddit and gave him mod privileges.  During that period, I Have gotten P-banned, Because of ""Spam"", But the thing is, I Didn't intend my projects to be Spam, I tried appealing, But it then got covered by the controversy that happened above, Therefore, My first account was gone, Since I couldn't be mod on my subreddit, This led to my ""Friend"" Inviting the people that harassed me, Onto the sub and made it about the ""Stupid shit"" I have done, I had no control over it.  At this point, I have changed my goal from ""Proving myself"" to ""Getting rid of negative information""  I have started a new account, And Tried to keep clear of those people, I'd figure it would help my situation, But unfortunately, It didn't, While I Used the second account, A subreddit ""Shrine"" then put me in their topics, And have made posts claiming that ""2020 would not be the bad guy anymore"" and how one post depicts my art character being shot, Which further deepens How badly I Want this situation to stop.  The second account got banned, For ""evasion"", Even though I Haven't broke any violations in the previous account, My goal is still undetermined, So I Made a third account.  I Temporarily diverted my attention to other subreddits so that the conflict would die down, as it wouldn't have happened, I turned my attention to the old subreddit I Have created, And have convinced a user to create a new one, Things here then took a turn-around, We abandoned the old subreddit, And went on the new one, The New one STARTED Out good.  When it began, We all just chatted, Apologized to each-other, and even made a few projects there as it was it's intended purpose, Until, It happened again.  You see, During that period, I Tried to make a Web-Show to show the world my ""Acting career"", It was just about reviewing games, While people have made fun of my appearance on it there, I'd ignored it, and then went on to pursue new things, Like Connecting to my classmates and trying to start chatting with girls, As it's high-school, I Don't want my future son to think I Was a Nerd during that age, I'm very strict about this thing.  I have also been introduced to Discord at the time, I Joined the server of our subreddit to get started, and at this point, The true opinions of me came from them.  In short terms, Almost everyone on that server didn't like me at all, They couldn't stand me, Even when I Tried to be polite, They still wouldn't concede, There was one user that didn't participate in harassing me, But I'll get on that topic later.  You see, When they get my insult of them, The first instinct of what came to their minds is by screenshotting it, Every time I Say it's justified, They bring up the screenshot and putting it out like They are the victim, However, They are sometimes right of what I do comment, But it doesn't deserve an entire subreddit built for that purpose.  Soon as you know it, Those screenshots are on the subreddit, Giving me, Once again, A Bad name.  At that point, I Was Completely Losing my shit, Until this one user ( Not revealing official, Call it ""BH"" ), Dm'ed and tried to discuss about what I Have been dealing with, And here's the part where I Have messed up.  Since I Wasn't socializing or talking to students for 3 Years, It gave me a disadvantage, I couldn't get a proper idea for ""Falling for a girl."" And here's when my speech becomes bad.  Because of how I depict my view of that topic, It caused me to simp at a Fictional character instead of someone in the real world, As I Didn't have any knowledge or confidence, or looks, that I Would have one, Because of this, It began a path as where I Would rather live in a fantasy then actual real life.  I had feelings for BH, As I Felt Like Someone Finally Cared for me And I Wanted to tell her, But I Couldn't, As the server would hate me, So I Dm'ed her, Admitting to her that fact, At first, She found it cute, And has thought that I Was kidding.  Then after a day or two, She asks me if I Was Roleplaying, And When I Said no, She started to have a grudge against me, and all those months later, I Try my best to show I Care for her, From poems, to projects, She wouldn't care a single bit.  One day, She told me that she was ""Bisexual"" or ""Trans"", Which Has Shocked me, but sadly, she took my shock the wrong way and has depicted it as ""Transphobia"", Which unfortunately, Brings down my reputation a whole lot.  This was my breaking point, At 7 Months of tolerating this, I have lost my mind and didn't care about my actions, So I Did the Unthinkable things that I Had no thought before they were done.  From Minor Sexual Harassment, To Racist Comments, To even depicting them in my posts in negative ways. (Ex. Putting them in my games without consent.), It was clear that at this point I Was on the verge of a breakdown.  This curbs down a whole lot more when I discovered google images surrounding these screenshots from the subreddit, And one of them shows my face attached next to it, Uncensored.  Ever since that happened, I Feared about Jail and death row, Because I Thought I Unintentionally caused a minor offensive, Even though, I don't want all of this to happen.  I had fears of my life being ruined because of that, I Had nightmares every night of death row and Jail-Bars, Even one about Unemployment and dying alone, It was enough to make me panic.  I even tried faking my own death so that it would go away, But even that didn't work.  So where does that bring me now? Well, At this point, Still, The exact same treatment, And multiple people from their tell me that I'm irredeemable, I Wouldn't put my blame all 100% on them, As I Admit, I Done a few of those things and feel bad about them and try to reconcile, But the fact of them not accepting any of my apologies along with the fact that my identity on the internet is now known as ""A Racist/Sexual Predator"" is absolutely horrifying.  Look, I'm not a bad guy, I Swear, I am nothing like I Am on the server, IRL, I'm quiet, Kind, And A bit lazy, But when my unintentional bad side comes and overshadows my actual personality, You know that's not good news.  As of right now, I'm literally begging on my hands and knees for them to remove the content and help me, But I Have no hope, no internet friends, and no future.  Bad Internet Reputations also lead to damages to my Employment for a Job, my online relationships in 20 Years, and my chance to make friends with new people.  With the thought of the internet damaging my future, The pain of my experience in school life wearing me down, and the thought of nobody knowing that I Even exist is where I Just don't feel the will to live anymore, And therefore, I cannot take this pain anymore.",ideation

1111,"2 weeks ago I was going to kill myself. I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt!       I hope that whoever is reading this will take my message to heart. My suicidal thoughts were  getting so bad, and my anxiety was even worse. I had nothing left to live for, I made many posts in this sub about how I felt. I was self harming myself practically every day. Then I decided I was done, and I had made a plan to do it. After all, we all die in the end anyways right? But once I had tied the rope, I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it.           A few days go by, and for some reason I decide to workout. I hadn‚Äôt done anything that was very physically intensive in months. I ran 2 miles and did the hardest workout I had ever done. Idk what happened that day, but something in me had changed after that, it was like the clouds around my brain parted for a moment and I saw the light, and I wanted to see all of it.                       I started a self betterment routine: everyday I would work out, mediate, and write in my journal. I started to feel amazing. My anxiety was going away, and I felt better about myself. I was happy. Then one day, late at night, I was watching funny videos and this one song played, and I tried to find it because it was a good song. The song was ‚ÄúOnce In A Lifetime‚Äù by Talking Heads.               The song is basically just an existential crisis in song form, and I started to have one. But then I realized something. Depression has made me feel like that there is no purpose to life, and that nothing will ever get better. And I realized that the depression was right, there is no purpose, and in the end we all die; but it‚Äôs not about the destination, it‚Äôs about the journey.              Every second, we are all living life, experiencing it. And we all know it sucks, and people always say, ‚Äúoh it gets better,‚Äù but we all know it doesn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt just get better, you make it better. It‚Äôs never to late to make a change, my change was my routine, and it opened my eyes to what life really is. Life is just this winding road, but we all choose which ways to turn. There‚Äôs no point in driving it, but if you keep going you can find amazing things. You can do anything, but you‚Äôll never know what happens. And I guess that‚Äôs the just the beauty of life. You just have to make the decision to put your foot on the gas pedal and go. Once you do, you can go anywhere, or see anything. Life is an adventure, and it‚Äôs YOUR adventure. So go and enjoy it, you only have one.",behavior

I've been hoping I die somehow for so long and I've been considering doing it myself for a while now. It seems at every turn my luck gets worse and worse. Everyone that knows me has even mentioned how shitty my luck is. It hasn't really bothered me but since I've started having other problems a while back, it just seems to have been amplified. At this point, I just expect everything to go wrong, which typically is what happens regardless of anything I try. Now I just deserve everything to go wrong and people to use me and mistreat me. I actually feel myself wanting people to use me and treat me poorly. I know that probably doesn't make sense but I deserve it. Really I deserve any kind of bad shit that comes my way. I'm a useless person anyway. I'm glad they can get some amusement from me or at least enjoy using me. I know I won't die soon because of how unlucky I am, so I'll have to do it myself eventually.

I live with a mom who has repeatedly sexually, physically, and verbally abused me both as a young boy and a verbally abuses me as an adult daily, i've been molested by two men, would get screamed at by my grandma and cousin and abused by teachers and students.  I was talking on the phone to my therapist about it and she felt baffled because I don't actually have options, I can't file for disability and the money would get stolen from me anyways, I can't go homeless, I can't rely on other family members, I have no friends, there are no programs that would accept me because i'm 19, so i'm too old for youth stuff unfortunately, i'm not in school, don't have a license, ID, my birth certificate. I'm a gay guy so the only thing I can think of is going into survival sex work since I can't get a job because of how cripplingly disabled I am by my mental health issues.  With all this being said I think it's time to end it, some people don't get the luck of the draw which I accept. I just want all this to calm down and my suffering to be non-existent, the only feasible way that seems to be the only inevitable route is dying. The only choice however is how long I wanna let myself live, if I wanna stay alive for a couple days then just end it or perhaps simply end it now, I already know if I take enough of my pills i'll go into cardiac arrest and then die, or simply have a swift heart attack and also die.

Unlikely knowing myself but still frightening.  A living nightmare brought on by my fear of honestly life.

i‚Äôve been with this therapist since february 2020, almost a year and a half. im a minor and did not want to go to therapy but after being baker acted for a suicide attempt my parents forced me to start with this new therapist. i immediately told my parents i didn‚Äôt like her and i wanted to switch. they didn‚Äôt listen. in the past year and a half i have begged so many times and they refuse to let me switch. they say she has worked with hundreds of kids and is the best in the city. after a year and a half, i am so so so much worse, and while i don‚Äôt at all blame her for that because that is mostly due to myself and my mental illness, she has offered no help or support at all and has only made me feel worse. i have never felt like we clicked, i feel like she doesn‚Äôt understand what i‚Äôm trying to say. i talk about myself and how i feel and she tells me i am wrong. ljke she is telling me how she thinks i feel instead of listening to me talk. she constantly gets mad at me for ‚Äúnot trying hard enough‚Äù even though i have repeatedly told her that it is hard for me. i struggle with social anxiety so it is hard for me to open up to strangers. she often asks me if there is anything i would like to talk about and then gets mad at me when i say no, even though i have told her i am too anxious to bring my own subjects to talk about. i feel scared about saying the wrong things to her because of how she will react. if she deems that i‚Äôm ‚Äúnot trying hard enough‚Äù she gets my parents involved and tells them to be very strict with me, even though she knows that we don‚Äôt have the best relationship and in the past it has only made things worse. i finish all my homework with maximum effort and she still complains that i‚Äôm not trying. if she doesn‚Äôt think i‚Äôm trying she calls me spoiled and selfish because i‚Äôm not ‚Äúusing the resources im given‚Äù which i totally understand that im very lucky to have parents that can afford and care enough to put me in therapy, but being called spoiled and selfish for ‚Äúnot trying‚Äù even though i am just sends me into a downward spiral of self hatred and makes my depression so much worse. when i tell her about my suicidal thoughts she says im just ‚Äúglamourizing/ glorifying death‚Äù and that i think it‚Äôs cool. which is rlly invalidating because she‚Äôs basically saying im suicidal for attention and because i think it‚Äôs cool. and when i try to calmly explain that i don‚Äôt at all think it‚Äôs cool, but i feel so trapped that i don‚Äôt see any other way out and im in so much unbearable pain that i can‚Äôt survive anymore she tells me ‚Äúno i think you‚Äôre just glamorizing it‚Äù which upsets me further. she tells me to ‚Äúchoose happiness‚Äù which again, i get where she‚Äôs coming from because i know that choosing to have a positive mindset is important to beating depression, but i tell her that it‚Äôs rlly hard for me because no matter how hard i try to be happy i end up even more miserable, she tells me that it‚Äôs my fault for not trying hard enough and that if i wanted to be positive and happy i would. she constantly points out my flaws and not in a therapeutic way. like when she starts session she always says ‚Äúhey how are you‚Äù and i said ‚Äúi‚Äôm good, how are you‚Äù to be polite she says ‚Äúugh that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre supposed to say you have to tell me how your week was, this is why i say you don‚Äôt even try. if you keep this up i‚Äôm going to have to tell your parents you aren‚Äôt trying.‚Äù also, the thing that is currently bothering me the most is her trying to discuss a disorder. now firstly, when she brought it up she said i could reject the diagnosis (non-verbal learning disorder). she told my mom and some teachers too to get multiple perspectives. everyone she talked to (parents, teachers, etc) said that it doesn‚Äôt sound like me at all and i meet none of the criteria. i talked to her about it and said ‚Äúhey i really don‚Äôt feel like i fit this at all, but i‚Äôm open to the diagnosis and would love to hear why you think i have this. if i have NVLD i would love to be diagnosed and get treatment but i don‚Äôt want to be misdiagnosed especially because no one who knows me thinks i have the symptoms.‚Äù so i tried to listen to her with an open mind but the things she said were complete bullshit. like she went over the symptoms list and just said things that were completely false (like things that just never happened) and refused to listen when i told her ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what happened‚Äù for example, last november i was at rock bottom, so suicidal and was failing out of school, so my parents switched me to a small private school with ten kids in my grade. i was so so so angry at them. also, on top of this the kids were actually insane (on my first day there one of them lied about being in sandy hook and another followed me through the parking garage). anyways, i was very angry and sad so instead of hanging out with the other kids during lunch break, i went up to the pharmacy and bought bottles of pills so i could try to kill myself. i spent the majority of my lunch breaks loooking for ways or places to kill myself because at the time my family was being very unsupportive and i wasn‚Äôt allowed to see my friends and i was going through so much. anyways, my therapist brought this up. and she said ‚Äúkids with NVLD often are ‚Äòloners‚Äô or isolate themselves and are socially awkward. you going off on your own during lunch shows this behavior.l‚Äù and i said ‚Äú i was literally trying to KILL MYSELF how are you going to use that as an example??!‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúi think it‚Äôs fair to use that as evidence you have NVLD‚Äù and all of her examples were like this!! and i was like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs literally no solid evidence and no one else who ACTUALLY KNOWS ME thinks i have this disorder it‚Äôs complete bullshit if you have real reasons fine but it‚Äôs not fair to use lies to make this claim instead of listening to me.‚Äù i just feel like it would be way more helpful and productive if i could explain how my brain works and how i interpret things and she tells me if that aligns with NVLD. but when i try that she says ‚Äúyeah that doesn‚Äôt seem like NVLD but i still think you have it‚Äù. like when she asks me a question and i say ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know‚Äù because i don‚Äôt like being put on the spot she says that that‚Äôs ‚Äúnot understanding broad concepts‚Äù so i automatically have NVLD. it‚Äôs just so frustrating. i told her i‚Äôve done so much research and watched so many videos about people talking about their experiences with NVLD and how it affects them and i relate to NONE OF IT and she doesn‚Äôt listen. my mom has done the same thing and also says she doesn‚Äôt see how it relates to me because i‚Äôm good at reading social cues, know what to say, am good at making friends, grasp concepts well, etc. it makes me really mad that she refuses to listen.

1202,"I'm alone I'm 21.  I only have a few friends, and I never get to see them.  I've never had an actual loving relationship, or sex.  The closest thing I ever had to a relationship ended horribly and has scared me off from trying, I think.  I think it's a subconscious thing.  I had a lot more friends when I was younger, and girls seemed more interested in me too.  Now, all I do is go to school, work, hate my life, and then come home to nobody and nothing.  I want to feel what love is actually like again but I can't really even make friends with people.  I haven't made more than a friend or two in college, and I'm graduating in a few months. There's a girl in my class that I'm interested in, and it feels like she's my last chance.  If I can't get a girlfriend in college, why should I expect to get one outside of college?  This is the easiest it's going to be, and I've failed.  She seems like she's interested in me sometimes, but then other times I feel like she couldn't care less.  I can't figure out her personality.  She seems kind of shy, I guess.  I can make her laugh pretty easily and sometimes she'll just randomly turn and look at me and smile.  Other times, like today, she kinda just brushes me off a bit.  Maybe she's playing with me, idk.  When class is over we just walk to our cars together.  We don't talk on the way there, only in class and through text sometimes.  She gets in her car, waves goodbye to me, and then I get in my car and leave.  Maybe I should grow the balls to say something, but what the fuck am I gonna say?  I used to enjoy being the bad guy, but not anymore.  I just want friends and someone to keep me company.  Someone to get me out of the house and do shit with.  I want someone to love, but at the same time, I feel like I'd never be able to keep anyone.  Maybe that's why I never make a move.  How am I going to keep her happy?  I have no experience and don't do/like anything that normal couples would like.  My humor is dark and most people don't like it.  I'm an introvert so that doesn't help either.  I've been trying to be positive, happy, and smiley around this girl, but even today some other girl in the class pointed out how I'm always making jokes about killing myself.  Really nice of her. We all sit next to each other.  The girl I'm into then seemed to pull back a bit.  I don't even have to dig my grave anymore.  Other people have me figured out and they'll do it for me.",ideation

So school was shit. Very hard times. Iam definitly very depressed since age 7. First time i started to think about suicide was puberty. And then age 16 it got really bad to the point were it became part of my personality. ""You can just suicide whenever you want, life sucks anyways"". But what does it do to you thinking about suicide half your life? I mean iam naming it suicide. But its literally killing yourself. More or less brutally. Iam thinking about cutting myself open and bleeding out, or considering if the feeling of shattering bones from jumping of a building is bearable. Iam thinking it, dreaming it and watching other people do it (on the internet). What type person can do this to their own body? Whatever. I have seen therapists. I get therapy. She doesnt even know i have depression. Wonder what happens if she figures it out. I dont tell her. Doesnt change anything anyways. Wonder what happens if she figures out i think about suicide?

1221,"Update: Soon I‚Äôm going to be gone. COVID-19 ended my life, and I didn‚Äôt even get sick. Sadly nothing's improving  My DUI case has finally come up  (read my post history) after a year ... I show up, they want to have me wear some kind of patches that detect drugs over the course of a year. They're expensive, and I can't afford them. I'm supposed to show up again for everyone to argue this over again in two weeks.  This DUI is for an anxiety prescription that I took as instructed, that had an unexpected reaction. I only took it once. If COVID-19 hadn't happened, I wouldn't have needed the medication.  I have been not taking anything for anxiety and have just lived with them several times a day. I was even given a prescription that should not have any of the effects given by previous medication, but I haven't. I'm too scared to take the chance.   I'm running through my savings and will likely be homeless.   That means this is still going to be on my record for a year and be dismissed. The problem until I can get this dismissed it will still be hard to get a decent job, any job. I've already lost jobs I applied to over this. I won't be able to get this expunged for a year. I feel like everything is conspiring to make me homeless and die on the streets in the near future. It's a sign for me to give up.  As I said earlier; I'm already the walking dead and I just need help my body to catch up to it.  More and more I'm thinking it's time. Time for me to leave this life.

To add some more shit ontop i am asexual or at least i think i am, as far as i can tell i have never been attracted to a man or women in my life time, never been on a date of course since i have never had a friend and everyday i just want to jump more, there is no enjoyment, no fun just dread of being a poor failure that will be homeless once my mom has had enough and has no chance as success in the future, the most successful future i can hope for is a trash apartment that i can pray i can afford on my cashier salary. I also just found out that I don't have a job anymore I was layed off for the winter and supposed to start again soon now I just found out they don't want me back so seems like just another reason to do it, when nothing good ever happens for you and it is just shit on shit on shit why keep going. I just want it over and i am going to make it happen soon, i have had enough and want it done",behavior
1260,"My family pushes me closer to ending it all every single day. What do I do? Hey. This feels like the 100th time I've posted on this subreddit, so I apologise for that.   My dad makes me feel like a burden. Like I'd be better off dead. Everything I do is just wrong in his eyes -- I'm never good enough, I'm not normal, I'm ruining everything. Today I actually got my ass out of bed and met up with some old friends who I haven't seen in a while, and I thought maybe he'd be proud of me for going out but apparently not. When I got home I walked into the living room where he was sitting, and I was on my phone because my friends and I took the train and I wanted to make sure they got home okay. He said that that was disrespectful because I didn't say 'hello' right away. Said he was slaving away at work for nothing and I was a little brat. The insults are a recurring theme. I feel worthless.   It's not even just my dad. My mum is constantly snapping at my sister and I about anything and everything and it makes me feel like I can't do anything right. When I say 'anything and everything', I don't mean chores or school or something I'd understand her complaining about, I mean she will literally bite my head off if I ask to make MYSELF food. If I don't ask, I'll still be in trouble. She and my dad both withhold food from me as a punishment, which is not doing wonders for my already poor appetite. I suppose I can't really blame my mum at all though -- my dad's horrid to her. He blames her for the autoimmune disease that's killing her. The hereditary autoimmune disease.   My little sister is the only person in my family who I feel like I have some vague connection with, and even that is such a faint feeling. I don't feel any love towards my parents and it makes me sick. I feel like I'm living with strangers, for the most part, even though they're both usually home. I wish they weren't. I wish one of them would hit me or injure me, because then at least I'd feel valid for hating them.   They just make me feel useless. Y'know? If I ruin everything, I'd be better off just not being here. I don't think they really like me much. Every jab and insult just pushes me closer and closer to early grave, and I don't know what to do anymore. I've already written so many suicide notes to the people I care about. My parents won't get one -- I wouldn't know what to say. I get so envious of my friends who have close relationships with their parents because it's just not something I've ever felt like I have, as much as my parents would insist otherwise. I saw a little kid run up to her dad with a grin on her face the other week and broke a little bit inside.  I don't know. Part of me thinks they'd be better if I was gone, and I think that part of me is probably right. Life keeps throwing all these obstacles at me. My cat got sick (again) and we think he's ingested something poisonous because he was foaming at the mouth. As pathetic as it sounds, my cat's always seemed to understand. I know he's a fucking cat, he doesn't really understand, but whenever I've been upset he's followed me around the house, whenever I've been about to cut my wrists, he's rubbed himself against my arms and stopped me. And now even he might go away -- but that's nothing to do with the post, I'm sorry.   I'm just sick of being treated like I'm nothing and want to kill myself every time I so much as think about my parents. I have to get out of this situation one way or another. What do I do?",behavior

I tried to stay strong for my cats, i promised them a good life and if i died, i could never give them that. But today, i dont know if i can keep going, even for them. Im not afraid of any physical pain if it means whatever is happening in my head and in my life stops hurting. Noone deserve to live in loneliness and pain. It's bad guys, really bad.

1263,"Misguided. sorry for leangth but I would read yours  This took a lot to share. Never done this before     So I'm a 27 year old father of 2, 6 year old and 1 year old. I've been with my wife almost 10 years. She's my crutch and so are they. Iv been going through life almost like wearing a mask always hiding my true self always pretending to be okay. Don't we all am i right.. I only reasently have sought out help but my growing up was something of a nightmare or a Stephen King novel evertime I think about it I can't understand it fully, why am I, who am I ,why me. I'm not okay not good at anything, have no real friends sept 1 or 2 that will sit with me in silence or just listen and try to help even though they truly never can. I just want someone to talk to truly that can, i guess kind of understand.   My thoughts on life are so dark when It comes to myself or just general existence itself. Whats the point. No one seems to care except about things in life not ones feelings or well being. How do I know cuss iv never really been asked about how I was really doing cuss they were concerned about my well being, or seeing the darkest sadness of silence within me and stamped on my face.  I can't remember the last time I was comfortable with who I am inside or the last time I found real joy in doing literally anything.   Yes I have kids and a wife but its my duty as a father to protect them and make sure they don't turn out like I am. What kind of person is the person that would want someone else to go through what I am, much less my own children. Mainly because I hade the best example of a father a non existent one, he fled my life not short after my mother pasted away in a car accadent who he mentaly and physically abused by him. I was only 3 years old when she passed so I don't know what its like to call someone mom or dad and ill be dammed if my sons have to experience that. I don't even remember my mother. And sadly all i can remember is my peace of shit  father.

1333,"Is therapy worth it/How to find a therapist? Hi. I'm feeling a little nervous about posting here as I don't want anyone in my real life to find out but I thought this would be a good resource for me. If this post shouldn't go here let me know and I'll take it down.   I'm a first time mom to a 9 month old boy. I've had issues with depression and anxiety since middle school but I've always been able to manage it ok. A few years ago I started taking birth control pills to regulate my hormones which really helped my mental health a lot, so when I got married I just stayed on the pill for preventing pregnancy as well. It clearly didn't work for me, as I now have a 9 month old baby. Since giving birth I've struggled with PPD and PPA, and I needed to start taking some form of birth control again to prevent another pregnancy, but the pill messes with breastfeeding and failed last time so I couldn't do that and got the arm implant instead. I don't know if my current issues have to do with the new implant or just PPD/PPA or just because I haven't been able to take the pill anymore or what, but it's getting bad.   My mental health has declined so much in the last 9 months I feel like I'm not even the same person. It's getting constantly worse and worse every day to the point where I have saved and hidden the bottle of oxycontin they gave me after giving birth (they gave it to me due to complications I won't go into rn), in case I want to take them all at once and end it. I've taken them out of the bottle and just held them in my hand a few times, but I was too weak to go through with it. I know I have enough of them to kill me. I know my husband and son would be better off without me. My son is so young, he wouldn't remember me so he wouldn't truly feel the loss later in life. My husband is young (we're early 20s) and a wonderful man so he could easily find someone else, someone better. I'm toxic and treat him badly. I know he walks on eggshells, the smallest thing can set me off and I have these extreme mood swings, I feel like a crazy person but I can't stop. I completely break down all the time for literally any reason or sometimes no reason. I hate myself. I'm angry and frustrated constantly but I can't show it to my son, I have to make myself smile and play with him and meet his emotional needs, so then I have no energy left for my husband. I'm completely emotionally drained. At the end of every day at I just lay in bed exhausted but unable to sleep, wishing I was dead. I don't want to feel like this anymore, I don't want to feel anything. When I think about death it feels like peace, it gives me comfort. I just want to lay down and sleep and never wake up.   My husband has tried so hard to support me, he took over most of the household chores and is an equal parent when we're both home. I told him I was really struggling and even having some suicidal thoughts but I downplayed it. He begs me to see a therapist but he's scared to push me on it. He tells me all the time he appreciates me, and that he and my son need me. It just makes me feel worse. I've treated my husband so badly and he still is so gentle and caring. He deserves so much better and he'll never leave me and I can't leave him, I cant do this without him, so I should just make the choice for him and he'll be forced to move on and find someone better. He wants me to see a therapist so bad, he's scared and I hate seeing him like this i wish I just hadn't told him. I just can't do this I can't call anyone I can't ask for help I don't want to sit in a room and have someone tell me how shitty I am, I know how shitty I am and I don't need a therapist to tell me about it. what are they going to tell me that I don't already know? How do you even go about finding a therapist? I asked my doctor a couple years ago and she said I have to look into all the therapists in my area and find one that takes my insurance. That feels like an insurmountable hill. Not to mention that even if I find one I might not click with them and I've heard you have to meet several therapists before you find the right one for you I just would rather end it and have this all be over. I don't know what to say to my husband. I have to take my son in for his 9 month checkup in 6 days and they're going to make me fill out that fucking mental health form and I don't know what to do. I dont want to lie, I HATE lying with every fiber of my being, but if I fill it out accurately it'll set off the red flags and they'll have to ask me a bunch of questions and what if they decide I'm not fit to parent because I might kill myselfand  what if they take my son away? What if they call CPS and they try to take him away from me? I would rather die than lose my son. I don't know what to do and I know rhis post is too long and I'm so sorry about that I just don't have anyone to talk to and I don't know what to do and I feel like killing myself is the only option that makes sense.",behavior

I barely passed my GCSEs, I dropped out of A levels when we (the uk) went into the first lockdown because my head of sixth form told me I was just going to fail anyways. I‚Äôve had a string of toxic relationships, been sexually abused a few times. I made really good friendships in the last year but in a matter of weeks I lost all of them and now they all hate me (it was my fault, I made a mistake and I fucked up, I deserved it). I feel so alone and so fucking numb, most days I can‚Äôt get out of bed. I used to get so passionate about things, I used to love so so strongly, but now the only thing I really feel is despair. It‚Äôs like death has a rope tied around me and it‚Äôs slowly dragging me away from everything. I wouldn‚Äôt even care if it just pulled a bit fucking quicker. I‚Äôm not scared of death at all, I haven‚Äôt been for years; I tried to kill myself back in May, I really thought I was going to die and I wasn‚Äôt scared at all, I was relieved that I would finally be able to rest properly. Since then it‚Äôs just gotten worse and all I can think about is how beautiful it would be just to suddenly cease to exist, to finally be at peace. The only reason I haven‚Äôt is because I feel so selfish leaving my mum on her own, she loves me so much and I love her, I just wish she could understand how much pain I‚Äôm in all the time and how difficult it is just to be alive. Actually fuck that, I‚Äôm not alive, I haven‚Äôt been alive for months, I‚Äôm just existing in a world that didn‚Äôt anticipate me surviving this long. Living isn‚Äôt lying in bed crying your eyes out every night. Living isn‚Äôt smiling to everyone and doing such a good job of convincing them you‚Äôre okay after years of practice. Living isn‚Äôt getting up and going about my day in a trance, feeling so numb it‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm watching someone else live my life for me while I crouch in the corner of my mind, shivering and sobbing. The worst part is that I don‚Äôt want to live. I don‚Äôt want to be happy because it makes it so much worse when you go back down again, I don‚Äôt want to be happy because that means having people around and all I‚Äôll do is hurt them. I just wish there was a way to stop existing and make everyone forget I ever existed in the first place. I don‚Äôt want people to mourn for me because I want to die to stop hurting them. I wish people could see how much pain I‚Äôm in and how exhausted I am so that maybe they could understand even slightly why I felt I had to do it. I wish people could just be happy that I‚Äôd be at peace for the first time in so long. I just really really want to die.",attempt

They can justify a person kill themselves if they are suffering with immense physical pain that isn‚Äôt going to go away considering how many options they have tried to reduce the suffering but to no avail. But when a person kills themselves if they are suffering with immense emotional pain that isn‚Äôt going to go away considering how many options they have tried to reduce the suffering but to no avail, then people say the suicide isn‚Äôt justified.

People go on and on about how you shouldn't feel guilty about not being there, but the truth is that I can't feel anything else. I really do wish that I was in the same room to tell him ""NO!"". I wish I was there to hug him a last time. I wonder a lot if he thought about me ... was I not enough to make him stay?  I've never quite cried this much in my life and my entire world is collapsing into this burning hell on Earth.

It's hurting me to think that life is going to move on.  I attended his funeral a week ago and listening to the pastor was disgusting. He was saying things like ""he chose to leave"". I do not believe that my best friend made the active choice to leave - he felt helpless and lonely - those are not the same thing. I will never believe that one thoughtfully considers the choice of killing themself.  I feel thrown off my path.

However in the span of 72 hours I‚Äôve needed to get glued back together in emerge twice, and I haven‚Äôt slept because I‚Äôm laying awake dissociating trying to not kill myself. Nothing feels real. I spend hours laying in one spot thinking about dying.   My friends left me when I became their boss at work, my partner just dumped me because I have too much going on, I‚Äôm broke and my solution to not having money is to be a sugar baby but I feel filthy because I‚Äôve been sexually assaulted and never dealt with the trauma, my ex from several years ago is saying I stabbed him (that never happened, he‚Äôs currently having a psychotic break. he sexually assaulted me and I dumped him. That was it), I was in ANOTHER car accident, and I failed a practical (frisbee, it‚Äôs a blow off course) because I was mourning the death of my friend who got hit by a car cycling in September. My bio mom told me she doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with my, my dad and step mom don‚Äôt want me if I‚Äôm trans (‚Äòyou‚Äôre a monster destroying our daughter‚Äô).   My life has always been hard. I‚Äôve been verbally, physically, and psychologically abused for much of it. I‚Äôve been sexually assaulted four times. I‚Äôm chronically ill with epilepsy, gastroparesis, and a rare blood disorder that has no cure and just destroys my body. My parents denied me access to doctors when I was a kid so my system is completely fucked up. I need surgery to repair some things and I just found that out. I keep pushing through but I‚Äôm so. So. Fucking. Tired. I can‚Äôt push through it anymore. My counsellor wanted to take me to the hospital yesterday but I managed to talk through things because I knew if I went to the hospital I couldn‚Äôt kill myself.   I took too many pills and I‚Äôm still alive. I got a little carried away with self harm and then didn‚Äôt treat it for a good hour hoping things would just end. I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I hate everything about myself. Nothing is good enough. I‚Äôm not good enough. I made a video saying goodbye. This isn‚Äôt my ex partner‚Äôs fault, even though it lines up with me being dumped (time wise). Did it affect things? yes. But it was more of a ‚Äòfinal straw‚Äô situation. I can‚Äôt bring myself to delete the video. I cant bring myself to think of the next 20 minutes let alone the next 24 hours.  My body and mind are a mess. My life is a rollercoaster I can‚Äôt get off of. I have nothing and no one. I already have someone who will take my pets when I die. I wish I could make things work. I‚Äôve tried so hard. But nothing helps. Everything always falls apart. Everything I touch breaks. I wreck everything. It feels like everything is out of my control; so I‚Äôm going to take back that control. I can control my life: whether I live or die. I know that if I die, everything will be better for everyone. Why push forward when there are so many reasons to give up. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.   These thoughts are all disjointed, none of my sentences flow properly; probably because I can‚Äôt focus and also because I‚Äôm just letting out what pops into my mind.

1476,"Suicide Survivor: My two cents First of all, I lost almost everyone I loved the most to untimely deaths in recent history. That includes the love of my life who died at 33, my father, several friends and family. I have attempted suicide so many times with full intention to carry it out and I never thought I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm grateful I‚Äôm alive.  I knew that covid would negatively affect people with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideations. I‚Äôve lost loved ones to suicide before, and last April was no exception.   I‚Äôve gone to funeral after funeral after funeral. Life doesn‚Äôt promise us anything except that one day it will be over, so until then why not stick it out?  I want to share a couple things that I hope will help some of you out there. My wish is that whoever is reading this will shed light.   ‚Ä¢ We tend to want to disappear in order to be found. We also can want to disappear from existence because we are tired and the burden gets beyond heavy. You‚Äôre more resilient than you think. There‚Äôs always someone out there you may not have met yet who has an open heart and hand to be there for you. Your life and existence is an unique as a fingerprint. It‚Äôs one thing to relate but be careful when you compare. Life isn‚Äôt a Competition as much as a lot of people make it out to be. Sometimes a lot of want to see if ‚Äúanyone cares‚Äù to find us....I‚Äôm telling you people do. Start with me because I do care about you...and I mean it.  ‚Ä¢ Why was I born? To make a difference for yourself and you have the power even in the smallest of ways to make a difference. I‚Äôve asked myself why the hell I had to be born. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt my mom abort me?‚Äù Crap like that. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask to be born.‚Äù Well, I‚Äôm here. I was given life for ME, and at the end of the day you were given life to allow yourself to enjoy. You can be there for people you care about, but you have to take time to look into what it really means to love yourself. Youtube has a lot of videos on self love. I know it seems like a dumb corny idea, but it‚Äôs worth giving yourself a fighting chance. You were born to go on a quest to experience more than just the lame and depressing situations we can feel stuck in. Reach out.   ‚Ä¢ The simple things in life can be more rewarding than you think. Mindfulness helps a ton. It may seem trivial, but as human beings the mind tends to be geared toward: instant gratification, quick fix, NEXT  Take time to actually taste the food and drink. Take time to focus on your body when you take deep breaths to relax. Meditation is underrated.  ‚Ä¢ Loneliness and longing for connection is normal. Amid this uncertain time, there are several platforms on cool new apps to meet new people. It may seem lame but you never know who you‚Äôre going to meet and connect with. You might actually enjoy yourself.   ‚Ä¢ We tend to have habits of thinking and cycles we revisit. The hardest part of breaking any habit is the beginning. Then it becomes easier and more rewarding, because the fruits of labor are.   ‚Ä¢ Allow yourself to be treated as if you were treating someone you love the most. We tend to negative self talk quite often and I‚Äôm telling you to cut that out immediately. We all have to keep ourselves in check but put down the bat. If you like to do art or sing because you like it even though you may feel like you‚Äôre not ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù, do it! Anyone can make art, and it‚Äôs so much healthier for the brain than people think. Don‚Äôt limit yourself. Don‚Äôt sell yourself short.   ‚Ä¢ Bad memories are part of life unfortunately, but there‚Äôs got to be at least one okay memory you have right? If you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúno‚Äù you‚Äôre lying to yourself. It‚Äôs okay, right now you feel like crap and it feels like everything absolutely 100% sucks....but give it a little time....you‚Äôll think of a good memory.....and perhaps (probably) there will be a good time in your future that you wouldn‚Äôt have imagined.

All that I have done is brought people pain.

Everybody in my life has left me. I‚Äôm glad they did for their sake. If I ended my life then at least that would be a positive impact. I wouldn‚Äôt hurt or burden anymore people.  I don‚Äôt deserve the life that I was given. I was born into a well off family with plenty of opportunities around me. Any other person would have done great things with their life and helped so many people.   I‚Äôm not good at anything. I have no talents. I have nothing to contribute. It seems my soul purpose in life is to blow my brains out. I am a waste of space who just occupys peoples time with my presence. The world would be better off if I was six feet under.   Even if I was a good person there would be no reason for me to keep going because life has no purpose. Life is a chaotic experience that brings suffering to even the kindest people. People like me only worsen the suffering and hurt around them.   There is no point in living in a universe in which there is no point in doing anything at all. Everything is random. Everything changes. Someday nobody will remember my existence.   I dream of the day I die. If I died I might be able to help someone who is in need of organs.

1563,"This is not Temporary... the pain never ends My name is Adam and i have been suicidal for as long as i can remember. It all started in school as a kid i was an awkward child in a small town, where you grow a reputation quickly, i was quickly known as the kid to stay away from if you want to be popular. I made my peace with it i thought maybe in high school i would have another chance, I quickly found out that wasnt the case, i got bullied like crazy in high school to the point that i really started considering it for the first time. I found out how to tie a noose and i found some rope in my dads workshop and tied one and kept it in my room and for long periods of time i would just look at it considering. I ended up not doing it thinking to myself, It must get better once school is over, that is what everyone keeps telling me they cant be lying right one day its going to get better. Then school ended with me never really having a friend in my life outside of my dog, never once having a sleep over or going to another kids house but i made it threw high school. Ontop of all that BS with just being a lonely piece of shit i have always been a failure when it comes to any kind of academics or skills that would lead to some kind of career, I am 25 years old and have never made over 10k a year, no kind of post secondary and no prospects to speak of what so ever. Still living with my mother and she wants me out more and more with each passing month, nothing saved to speak of, at this point i have moved on from the noose and i think about a cliff near my house and have decided when i do it it will be there as i imagine it being the least painful. To add some more shit ontop i am asexual or at least i think i am, as far as i can tell i have never been attracted to a man or women in my life time, never been on a date of course since i have never had a friend and everyday i just want to jump more, there is no enjoyment, no fun just dread of being a poor failure that will be homeless once my mom has had enough and has no chance as success in the future, the most successful future i can hope for is a trash apartment that i can pray i can afford on my cashier salary. I also just found out that I don't have a job anymore I was layed off for the winter and supposed to start again soon now I just found out they don't want me back so seems like just another reason to do it, when nothing good ever happens for you and it is just shit on shit on shit why keep going.

1566,"Why i want to die. Before I talk about my experiences as a child, I would like to disclaim that i come from a very African and extremely religious background.  My parents are both Nigerian immigrants, so they didn't exactly have a Western upbringing. I am only 15(as of me writing this) and i have a very complex relationship with my parents.   To cut the long story short, I am the black sheep of my family. I am  perceived as the troublemaker and i am first one to be accused of something when something goes wrong.(e.g, if something gets broken) My parents think i am bad influence on my younger brother and i  should follow in the example  of my older brother.(But i have to act like the oldest brother anyway because my brother is very emotionally immature and may been on the spectrum) And i am not going lie; i can be very rebellious. My parents find  me to be the most outspoken out of my brothers and i question lot of things; including religion.(I will get onto that later)   The person i have the most issues within the family is my mother. My dad wasn't home that often due to his long business trips, so most of my early childhood was spent with only my mum and my 2 brothers. My mum had a huge temper and would get riled up over the most trivial things. She was also extremly determined for us to do well in school, so she was extremely hard on us. Without my father around to ease her temper, she fully embraced a ""spare the rod, spare the child mentality"".  She was the hardest on me especially, since i was somewhat mischievous when i was younger but some of the punishments she gave me still tramuatize me till this day.  Imagine being beaten for having bad handwriting instead being helped. Imagine being teased and called names by your mother when you wet the bed.(""The Pee Master"")  Imagine  being told to stay and die while choking on a Dorito chip by your own mother at 9 years old. Imagine being 7 or 8 years old and grabbed , pulled upside down and put my head near the toliet hole just for not understanding a maths homework and yelled at.("" Do it properly! Do It Properly!) Imagine being chased out of your piano lesson because you lied about losing your music theory book, manipulated to come back to her (because i was smaller and faster than her, i was only 9); then dragged back into the building and thrown onto the stairs. Punched in the face twice, giving you a small bruise under the eye and bitten on the leg to stop you from escaping. The other students heard my screams. Imagine being forced by your father to say I'm a Christian (even though im athiest) because im afraid that this 55 year old man is going to hit my 13 year old face; your mum then forcing you to read Bible verses. Imagine barely escaping being stabbed and robbed by gang affiliates and your own mother instead of comforting you; said it was your fault , didn't care you got killed and said you were a bad influence on your younger brother. And then later on, ""apologising"" by saying, ""I have to be hard on you"". Thanks a lot mum, you gave the best gifts a child could ever  have; mental scars and anger issues.  And that's only the half of it. I am also severely bullied at school but that's a different story.   Now i am not ignoring the fact that my mother is human too and she has issues of her own. Her own mother died when she was 9 and her dad had 5 wives.(It was 60s/70s Nigeria, it was a different time) She often said that she had to grow up fast and look after her other siblings. Her younger brother(my uncle) got pancreatic cancer and slowly died in our house.  But im not going to deny the fact that she especially, hurt me deeply. Sometimes at the back of my mind, i ponder at the idea that it was my fault why she treated me that way. Maybe i pestered her on the wrong day, or i behaved too badly and needed that discipline.  Was it abuse?",ideation

After I made it clear I dont like his idea and he crosses my morals and boundaries he apologised and explained he was frustrated and seems to have dropped the idea BUT It's just so unusual behaviour and so weird. On top of this I don't believe anything he says to me. Even yesterday he told me he loves me randomly and I couldn't help but think it's fake. Same with his plans of what we should do when we marry. Can there be any other explanations beside him being pimp? I dont think there is much left in the relationship anyway but lowkey wish he isn't pimp.,indicator

Probably why he stole everyone she brought for me and some stuff of hers. When people want to change when they feel like it, everything is ""the past is the past"" but ohh when you do something its different. We will get to that.

Looking back at it now I feel as though they did it to save face and to this day I regret ever getting closer to them. Backfired on me.

So, my mind told me I didn't need to check on her all those months - she was definitely doing well after moving on from me and finding someone else.   She placed a missed call yesterday¬†morning¬†and I¬†called back later that night¬†to check why.¬†I was anxious to pick up¬†because her call¬†meant something serious. She told me she called to hear my voice and apologise for telling me we couldn't work out.   I knew something was up so tried¬†to stay as calm as possible. I told her it was lovely to hear from her, asked her¬†where she was, if anyone was with her¬†etc. and she told me she was alone¬†in her flat, she apologised for calling earlier and that she was just dealing with a small overdose. I knew I had to get her medical attention¬†. We finished the call without me telling her I was driving to her flat.  I got to¬†her flat and told her I just wanted to see her, to¬†speak to her. She let me in and we were so quiet. Nobody spoke for about 15 minutes,¬†until I noticed she was getting off the sofa and I just went up to her and held her really tight. I didn't¬†want her to leave, I didn't¬†want her to go out of my sight for a second. I knew I had to be extra careful with my words to get her to come with me to the hospital. We sat talking about everything¬†for a good 4 or so hours and I could tell she was in visible pain. I tried to be as subtle as possible, told her let's go together and check on you, just a quick check to see what's going on but it'll¬†ultimately be your choice whether you want that treatment or not. She told me she wouldn't go, that she just wanted to wait at home for everything to end. We were silent for a while after she said that. I¬†felt¬†like I fucked up with my words because she¬†didn't¬†budge. I left her flat and just sat in the car,¬†I couldn't just sit at home and¬†let it happen. I walked¬†back to her flat a few hours later, called emergency services and begged for her to come, just for a check up and somehow convinced her when they arrived.  I don't¬†know what to do, I¬†could only call those who knew about our relationship (all but one are¬†outside the city), so¬†I have almost no physical¬†support. I've not slept in so long and called in sick for work today. What do I do if she gets upset with me?¬†What can I do to help prevent this being repeated in the future? Please just anything you think helped you or someone you know.¬†",indicator

1621,"I see no point in continuing this nonsense. I don't see a point in much of anything anymore. Living, ""getting better,"" getting a job, going back to school, talking to people, trying to eat/sleep/take care of my hygiene better, having hobbies, exercising, taking care of my pets. None of it inspires me, excites me, motivates me.  There's no satisfaction to any of it. No reward. Just an empty, hollow relief that dies out when I realize I have to do the thing again. It's not to say I don't get some of it done but, it takes so much strength.  None of these things make anything better. Nothing gets better, or stays there. Everything is constantly decaying. My will to live is at an all time low. There's so much *work* to living, and I'm so uninterested in all of it. The people that I know I love, and know they love me, mean nothing to me. I feel guilt and shame admitting it. Their presence does not outdo the pain.  I really do believe that I genuinely want to die. A life with this brain, with all these damn diagnoses. ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, all the fucking trauma that treating NONE of it has given me. I don't get to choose my brain chemistry. I don't get to choose to be functional, to heal. My surroundings and health don't let me.  I'll ALWAYS have to struggle, with all of it. I don't ever grow. I don't ever change. Nothing that I could control has ever helped. What got me going to school was the threat of literal violence against me if I wouldn't go. What got me to work was the threat that my girlfriend at the time would leave me if I didn't get a job. What made me work was fear. Fear of pain, fear of abandonment.  But those fears have been realized. My suffering continues in spite of my efforts to get better. My pain, my loneliness, my depression, it has all overtaken my strength and suppressed it. I tried so hard, for so long, to make so many people happy. Or at least, satisfy them enough so that they'd stop screaming at me. Nobody has ever been happy by what I had accomplished. They just scream at me and insult me and give up on me. I guess it's better than when I'd get beaten with a belt for having low grades but, ultimately that's all that life is. Punishment for trying.  Go work 80 hours a week and live in a motel because you're paid like shit and everything is so expensive. Go get a degree that will put you in lifelong debt so that you can get a raise of 2 cents compared to your uneducated peers. Go have hobbies so that people can belittle you everyday about them and tell you it's a waste of time. Go to doctors and therapists who tell you constantly that you're everything that's wrong with your life, essentially, and deny you treatment because you aren't useful to society. Take care of your basic survival so you can keep doing this bullshit, stress over every essential thing constantly. And better yet! The world is burning and society is going to collapse in your lifetime.  Why? Why live through that? I'll never have anywhere or anyone who is a truly safe space. I'll never be comforted by anyone's love. Familial, platonic, romantic, anyone. Everyone else is building up their life, moving forward. Leaving me behind. Why would they spend time with me? What do I have to offer? Jack fucking shit.  I'm an unmotivated, grotesquely deformed, waste of bone and flesh on this Earth. I would serve more purpose rotting than I ever could alive. But every single time I've ever tried to hurt myself, not even off myself, but any self harm, I can't do it. I want to SO badly. SO damn badly. I'm just so weak, so stupid and cowardly. I can't.   I don't even know why I wrote all this. It hasn't helped. There are no kind words from strangers or tips &amp; tricks that can outdo the degree to which I am miserable. All I ever really wanted was to been seen, heard, valued. Really truly loved from the depths of someone's soul, unconditionally. So many people in my life have abandoned me. They do one thing, say another. Insulted me for trying, critiqued me for existing, belittled me for my passions. I am nothing. I am absolutely, positively, nothing.",ideation

I obviously cannot stop thinking of the future in the immediate present without a good sum of damage being done to, well, my future... so it's self-perpetuating. I can't take that much more. Let's start with modern events. My mother was in the CIA and not only had she given me a supreme love and appreciation for what they do, she has shown me how much they give up to do it -- they give up, on some level, their freedom so that others can have theirs. This damages their sense of self so badly that they can develop mixed depression, anxiety, PTSD and BPD as well as NPD on top of it. Imagine having that as your mother, no matter how understandable the reasoning behind it is. Seeing certain aspects of her job crushed and used politically for either side actually damages a part of my self-identity, as I often used them as a standard for myself to measure up to as I've inherited many of her less beneficial traits **and** acquired PTSD from her (and my school's) treatment of me.  Alone, it's a huge weight to bear -- my past, for better and worse. However, remember how I said I had inherited many of her less beneficial traits? I'm autistic. I have ADHD. I have major depressive disorder, as well as anxiety on top. I also have PTSD. These things *prevent* me from working -- from taking proper instruction, from learning like everyone else, to even handling certain objects because of their texture or how they sound or feel (I would rather be NAKED than have sand in my boots, for example, and I will take my clothing off instead of 'dealing with' the sensations, they're so unbearable.)  I also have an IQ of... I think, 163 as tested when I was around 7. I'm AWARE of all of this. I'm trapped in some weird sack of meat that doesn't cooperate with me. I share a symbiotic relationship with it, and I love it dearly, but it's just so heart-breaking to have so many people expect so much of me because of a number everyone -- supposedly -- assumes is meaningless for good reason. They ignore, for example, the fact I even can wound myself so badly with a single centimeter-deep gash that the floor is covered in blood. It really would have been nice if the people in my past took my advice and just let me get a lethal dose of morphine to put an end to my suffer, but I'm so afraid now that my future is solely me as either a hunter-gatherer -- illegal -- or me as a criminal, the likes of which have died early or hurt so many people because of their cunning.

She was screaming at me. I eventually went into crisis and screamed back, begging her to scall the cops to get me out of there. I threatened suicide, to kill her. I threw a brick at my wall and now there's a hole. She kicked me out and i came back an hour later. She said she was calling the cops so she wouldn't get in trouble for kicking me out. Not because she cared about me, but because she didn't want charges. She forced me to leave, throwing my shit at me. I refused this time, and waited in my room. I just went on my phone and cried. We've had fights but never this big. I went to get my dog for comfort and she just ran away. That was the worst part. I decided to try to kill myself but had nothing. I told my mom I was going to kill myself and she told me to just do it. I sat around then decided to pierce my belly button because I had just gone out to get the jewelry and I really liked the ring. I'd been wanting it for a while and this was my last chance before the cops came. I positioned the needle and just as I was about to push the cops knocked on the door. I was so scared I decided to do it as fast as possible so I wouldn't make things worse. Did it in 30 seconds. Love the piercing but it really hurts now. The cops came in and talked to me, asked what I wanted to do. I said I wanted to go to the psych ward so I could leave the house for short term. They let me pack up. When they came back I showed the new cop my stuffies. Theres another cop who always shows up and she thinks she's on first name basis with me but I hate her.

Your grandmother dies of a disease ravaging your family tree. You quietly wonder how long you are going to have. You go to see her whenever you can afford it, and watch as she withers in front of you. She tells you to respect the doctor with the nice suit, no matter what you overhear him say. Her last words to you are goodbye. You thank her for the suit she bought you that got you into medical school. You are having a fight with your brother on Christmas, just like you do every year. He puts your career at risk. You finally cut him out (again), the world falls apart. They announce that starting next year Step 1 is going Pass/Fail, but not for you.

By choosing to speak out I‚Äôve managed to fundraise money for some medical bills and found an online community who supports me. All of that would need to be deleted if I agree to do what his lawyers say. I already feel so isolated. The laser eye surgery left me with nerve damage and a chronic pain condition so I can‚Äôt work and spend a lot of my time recently in hospital or seeing doctors.

1827,"For fucks sake I don‚Äôt want to be here I‚Äôm 16, I haven‚Äôt directly asked about my past but split parents at birth and a weekend schedule make it pretty obvious I was an accident,  I fucking can‚Äôt stand it here, I‚Äôve learnt my father is a broken man and to be honest I can‚Äôt blame him, his life is worse than mine by a long shot, but I‚Äôm well on my way to being in his position if I don‚Äôt do something soon  I hate that I can‚Äôt go to the shops alone without wanting to throw up because I‚Äôm afraid of interacting with the cashier and making an idiot of myself and feeling that nauseating eating sensation in my stomach that comes from making an idiot of myself in public. I hate that I lost my girlfriend of 3 fucking years (a lot of time to someone who has only lived 16) because I had to move away and making contact again just wouldn‚Äôt happen. I hate that I can‚Äôt talk to anybody about this because it brings attention to me that I don‚Äôt know how to handle, I hate that I don‚Äôt feel attraction to anybody anymore (though that might be a blessing to be honest), I hate that my friendships are loose enough that I could block everyone I know and nobody would bat an eye, I hate that I can‚Äôt plunge a kitchen knife into my carotid artery and die because I‚Äôm scared of the pain  The thing that pisses me off the most is that I was robbed blind by life. I was doing great until around 11 years old, at that age you start maturity and all that fun stuff and that‚Äôs when kids get reaally nasty. But it‚Äôs ok because your friends are going through it too right? Well not when you get fucking transferred to a different school and get relentlessly bullied for a whole year, then proceed to go to high school where people all know each other because tight communities that you were never a part of, and as such you don‚Äôt get bullied no no no no. You get to be that kid that just isn‚Äôt worth as much as anyone else, you are the last pick in everything but also the first to get kicked out, you‚Äôre the type of kid that voices their opinion but you would be lucky to have it get laughed off never mind acknowledged.   Since all of that wasn‚Äôt enough to break a small 11 year olds psyche, life decided that the dickhead husband to my mother that I never bothered to get attached to left and we had to move house by ourselves while also looking after a 4 year old kid (my little sister). So after every day at school I came home to a depressed wailing mother and a blissfully unaware little sister. I spent 5 years worrying about everything from myself to exams that didn‚Äôt even matter to blah blah blah, I didn‚Äôt believe my life would get any better.  It hasn‚Äôt, being realistic it‚Äôs been more of the same. The pandemic was the best thing that has ever happened to me but i figure it‚Äôs just life telling me to enjoy what time I have left before I end it all. I‚Äôve wore a smile and pretended everything is ok for longer than I care to remember. But I‚Äôm starting to show tiny cracks to people without realising, I am inching closer to letting everything go despite me wanting to live oh so desperately. I won‚Äôt kill myself, not yet, I have a little sister I need to watch grow up and I haven‚Äôt failed everything, but the day I do is when I go back to the ground that all life came from.

If I weren't autistic, I wouldn't be interesting but I also wouldn't had to suffer through ableist schooling my entire life. I'd be normal and happy and smart instead of suicidal for... going on a decade, now?   I'm a high school senior in a specialized school. The reason I came here was to build up my art skills (I have a hella strong passion for animation) and be a child prodigy to prove everyone that I wasn't retarded; my old teachers who looked down on me and didn't even give me the support I needed in k-8, my parents who defended my teachers religiously, the classmates who bullied me ruthlessly, and most of all, myself. And I couldn't even do it.   My grades are low even when I had put in over 13 hours of work some days. Over 70% of the class of 2021 takes AP courses and has a lot of success coming their way, meanwhile I do algebra 2 with grade 10s and struggle my way to not being the rock-bottom member of that class. I'm terrified to even see my GPA. The general ed classes are almost lonely because so many kids are in AP. All my friends are in AP courses and haven't texted me about anything not school-related since the year began. And I don't measure up to my dream schools' standards because I'm a C+ student at best with no accomplishments except being a drama club member for 3 months (which I had to stop in order to get my grades up even though it made me happy.) Not a single one. All because I'm a dumb kid.   So I'm throwing in the towel. Not going to art school. It just... it simply can't be done. There's no point giving myself a several-month headache with the application process when I know for a fact I won't be accepted since I don't measure up. And even if it could, then it's all student loans and burnout and pain and too much responsibility for a 17-year-old to carry, anyways. I hate my life. I hate my present. My past is even worse. And now because of that, the future's pretty fucked up too. I don't know why I got my hopes up. Give me one reason to not take that 15 minute walk to the train station and die in the tracks. Or to just sit on the road and wait. Or to take a bunch of the ibuprofen I've got in my room.

Long Story  So I'm writing this as a last-ditch effort, for a version of myself that wants a better life than I currently have. I‚Äôll try to be as brief as I can, I grew up in a single-parent household with an overly protective religious parent. I am the oldest of three siblings on my mothers' side, I have too many siblings to count on my religious dads‚Äô side.  I grew up taking care of my siblings BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT FATHERS AND OUR FATHERS ARE EITHER DEAD OR TRASH, OR BOTH, and again single black mother with no college education and an indifferent extended family. My immediate family and I were in and out of homelessness throughout my middle &amp; high school years due to both my younger brothers and my mother's frequent sick spells.  At some point during all this, I decided that I was going to commit suicide because I couldn‚Äôt imagine a life beyond being there to helping her and my siblings and I felt pretty empty inside.  Growing up in high school I became aware that I was gay or at least BI and was living in the household that I was living in, this is also around the time I learned that my estranged father died. I became detached and isolated myself in high school and away from my family at home. After a time I became involved with my local community center and did a lot of volunteering to keep busy.  Through volunteering, I was shown that there could be a future beyond my current circumstances. I became the face of multiple programs for teens at the community center.  I graduated high school and managed to get into the college I wanted to attend in a different city. A few program directors as well as the founder of my community center gave me both supplies and some resources to make my first year at university easier.  I was able to meet up with a Community Center alum who was attending the same university I was going to and they were going to show me the ropes. I somehow involved my mother in the process and she suggested that I go to a different campus than the one I had set up so that another member of my estranged family could check in on me.  From that point forward it was a slow march downhill, I realized that I was surrounded by people who knew what they wanted and I had no clue. I was still pretending to be straight and pretending to have my shit together and didn't. In truth, I felt empty, alone, and guilty that I had left my family. I was also reminded that I was poor and university life cost money that I didn't have. I got a credit card and went into debt buying college books. I had an emotional and mental break, I failed out of university. I had a falling out with the nearby family member when I failed out of school because I was without an immediate way home and wanted to try and work and get back into school.  From that point onward I was back to feeling suicidal, I tried to regain lost ground but I was ashamed that I had failed, and let my mentors down. I eventual was able to return home and back to more isolation. My depression grew to the point that some days I was bedridden. That was in 2011 and here I am in 2020 feeling just as lost and isolated, things that I once enjoyed I don't now. I came out to my mom, she initially didn't take it well and to this day doesn't take it well. I feel like I have been lying to myself and others for so long that I no longer know what I want from life or why it's worth living. I feel empty, I want to feel like living again. I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life, I don't know what to do with my career, I‚Äôm in debt to the state and several universities due to me failing classes, I can't afford out of pocket tuition, and have been bouncing from job to job listlessly trying to get into a better financial position while dealing with some of the legit worst people on Earth. I‚Äôm the most overweight I‚Äôve ever been. I‚Äôm just at a loss and I need to figure out where I go from here. I'm tired of feeling this way.  TL;DR  I‚Äôm suicidal, I don't know what to do with my life or career, I‚Äôve been depressed for so long that I‚Äôve lost interest in most things that used to bring me joy. I'm in debt to several educational institutions and am currently unable to continue a formal education because I can't afford it. I am currently very overweight and have always had body dysmorphia issues. I'm currently out of a job Idk what I‚Äôm going to do or if it‚Äôs even worth it to try. This is a final cry for help, idk what I‚Äôm expecting from here but at the very least this will have been a brief account of my life.",ideation

1885,"I envy you To everyone talking about killing themselves because of relationship problems or social anxiety just know that there‚Äôs at least one person who would trade you for your life in an instant. You really have no idea how bad life can actually be.  When I was 18 I watched my grandfather die of cancer. This was my first experience with death and by far the easiest problem I‚Äôve faced since. He was a foundational block in my family that eventually got too old and died peacefully with the rest of us there to comfort him.  Next was my little cousin. I say cousin but he was more like my brother. I talked to him every single day and every single night. He was my best friend. Words cannot describe how much I loved that kid and wish to this day I could trade places with him. He died of a heart attack 3 hours after I got off the phone with him. That kind of pain is beyond what I can type in a post. This happened in 2018 and to this day I wake up absolutely reeling in pain. I‚Äôve screamed until I can‚Äôt, cried endlessly until my eyes felt like they were gonna bleed, and repeated this cycle indefinitely.  After him my uncle was murdered for $1,200 by people I had known for a while. I went to school with their younger brother. My uncle and I ran a little slot machine room and these guys came by pretty often. They were poor like everyone else in my town so we gave them drinks and snacks while they dropped a couple dollars in the machines here and there. After I left for school they stabbed him 39 times. 15 of which was in the face. This was 3 days before his son who I have helped raise since I was littles birthday. I had to look this kid in the eyes and tell him everything was going to be ok when I knew it wasn‚Äôt. This was the second hardest thing I‚Äôve ever lived through.  After all the death my mom thought it would be a good time to split after numerous accusations of infidelity on both sides so she took off. Dad being the fucking prick he is got mad and burned my family home down.  Now I get to tell you all about what my A1 parents were doing while my entire life was crumbling before 20 year old eyes. I begged and pleaded them to let me come home from college. All I wanted to do was be around my family and friends. To give myself a chance to at least try to heal from the horrible fucking trauma that was continuously happening in my life. They weren‚Äôt having it. They ridiculed and threatened to cut me off of everything if I dared leave. I was fucking dying inside and they they forced me to fucking watch from the sidelines. But it‚Äôd be too easy to just isolate me from everything happening. No instead they had to make sure to weaponize me every single chance they had to attack one another. Every time they pissed each other off during this horrible fucking multi-year long divorce they made sure to call me screaming. I heard every. Single. Detail. I read my dad‚Äôs suicide notes. I watched the fucking videos where he ‚Äúfinally was gonna do it this time‚Äù fucking prick I wish he did. My mom was just as crazy. Every single day it was something else with her. Bashing her car into my dads truck. Sneaking into his new apartment slashing his beds and bleaching his clothes. I come from a small town so everyone I knew was watching this happen with me. I‚Äôd almost be embarrassed if I wasn‚Äôt so busy literally trembling to the point where I couldn‚Äôt be in public. At this point I hadn‚Äôt left my room in years. Honestly that‚Äôs not even the full story but I don‚Äôt have any energy left to type the rest out.   TLDR: My life is quite literally a worse case scenario. I still think about suicide every now and then but DON‚ÄôT FUCKING KILL YOURSELF OVER BULLSHIT RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS OR GENERAL ANXIETY. You are redeemable.",ideation

I'm honestly not looking forward to my 21st birthday because after that, everyone expects you to be a REAL adult and any social pressures I'm already struggling with are only going to get worse. I don't want to dress up in a fancy dress that day because all of them make me look fat. I can't drink because I'm on meds, plus I don't like alcohol, and either of these things are going to make me a social outcast for now on, making it harder to make friends, let alone find someone to date. Why? Because guys my age don't like women who are prudes/don't party and alcohol is a HUGE part of the college experience.   I've hated college so far, and I literally have classes tomorrow. The only thing that's keeping me going at this point is the idea that I only have to make it until my 21st birthday until I can legally overdose and drink a pint of vodka if I really want to. Aka, at-will suicide. Which is incredibly tempting, when I honestly can't and really don't see a way out.  I don't care if I'm ""smart"", I don't care if I'm ""talented"", I don't care if I've made the dean's list in college. All I want to be right now is dead. Fucking dead. Because then all my pain would go away. I'd rather tough out drinking charcoal in a hospital than think about living the next 50-60 years of my life in complete misery.  My start of my year has been absolutely miserable, with the guy I'm really interested in telling me he likes me but doesn't want to date right now, being diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety (aka finding out that you're mentally ill after having to veto a third diagnosis from a ***double*** board-certified psychiatrist), my best friend showing a nasty side to her and full-on betraying me, and borderline losing my job because of legitimately forgetting about showing up to my work shift *because* of depression/emotional issues.  Every friendship and potential romantic relationship has turned to shit for me. Nothing in that area in my life has worked out for me so far.  I know to everyone else, I'm ""young"", but I feel like my life is already going downhill and it's only going to get worse and worse from here.  I honestly want to be run over by a car. I can't drive safe anymore. I hate myself, hate my life, and would hate to hurt my parents if I was dead, but I can't do this anymore.

Cognitively, I knew not to kill myself, which should probably preclude me from posting here in the first place. However, my first bodily instinct was to do something against myself. I had been experiencing fleeting suicidal ideations for a long time, but only tried to act on them once some years ago.   Family tell me I'm irrational when I get like that. To them I say, ""gee, you think?"" But that's not the point. The point is when I get that way, it hurts. A lot. And it feels like there is no way out. And I will always be under an anxiety attack. And even if I'm not, it will happen again. And again. And again. And again x1000. And that's no way to live.  I called the hotline instead, and they tell me to distract myself. I go to therapy and he tells me to express anger differently. I go to my mother and she is devastated that she doesn't know how to help. I may be alive, but I still feel like useless a sack of crap. I'm still aimless on this front, but I know one thing: I still have an ounce of self preservation. I'm not dead, but God does it feel like I should be, but not by me.

1965,"Why I Believe my Life is Simply Not Worth Living (1st post, please read) I'm a 16 year old girl &amp; I've recently realized that life isn't as good as I was once thought it was. For my entire childhood I've felt chronic melancholy or this horrible feeling that something was horribly wrong, even though there wasn't. As far as I know, I had a very healthy and loving upbringing, but for some reason I've always felt like I was put here on this planet to be hated, it's almost like a fact to me. Even when I was 4 years old I strongly believed this, &amp; I still do, &amp; I have no idea why. I have had chronic depression since 7th grade, very bad social anxiety, germaphobic OCD, lots of anxiety about tons of different things, horrible attention span/focusing issues, &amp; now I have POCD, which has made me the saddest out of all of these. I hate school SO much. Even writing one sentence for an English project saps all my energy. I have about 5 hours of homework every day but I usually only do a bit or sometimes none. What's bothering me now is that I have thought horrible things in the past, like when I was 8th grade I said I wanted to ""shoot up"" my school because I thought everyone hated me, even though they probably didn't at all. And I think I really did. I hate myself for saying this. It's weird to think that I said that because I'm such a different person now. But sometimes I get scared that maybe if I was pushed enough I would think that again. I don't feel like I would, but then again how do I know? I've never even killed a fly, I feel too bad. I'm just so confused &amp; I'm not scared of death because my life has been more painful and terrifying than death will ever be. I feel like I've always been a horrible disgusting person &amp; death is the perfect thing for me to pursue.",ideation
