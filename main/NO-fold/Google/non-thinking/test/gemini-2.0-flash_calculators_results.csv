0,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.'Tired.",0,indicator,"ideation

1,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"ideation

6,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him?

I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain .

Maybe he won't say anything but I feel like I worried him for nothing. Now I feel like I should stop texting him for a few days because I honestly feel like a burden. \n\nI can't keep it all to myself. I end up going to a dark place and feel alone. I self-harmed one time a from anxiety and guilt that snowballed. I feel those thoughts creeping up and I really don't want it to lead to that. \n\nI also just have a hard time opening up to friends. Mostly because I feel like there needs a place and time. I'm getting better at opening up more and more but it takes time and mental health discussions are something that I haven't worked towards yet.

22,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever.

A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"attempt

60,"'I know I should die for the good of a lot of people. But I am a coward who could not take a few seconds of pain. As always I remain a living fat bastard unworthy of anything. Here I am yet again the same loser who would never make it out of this treacherous pit. I\'ve been trying to push myself to kill myself for the last few weeks. Tgere were moments of ups and downs. But I just cant. I chicken out like I did in almost everything in life. \n\nI\'m almost 30 years old for fuck sake. I don\'t have a job coz I am so stressed to work in the fucking accounting and auditing field I have knowledge about. I am ""trying"" to get a job for the sake of my grandma eho us worried sick of me. My parents are still trusting my sorry ass that I would find a job and get martied snd ""live happily ever after"". How can I tell them that I have let them down?\n\n The rest of my family have lost hope in me. I have had warnings and serious advices from all family members to get my act straight. I\'ve been called a laxy bum by my relatives. My brother calls me a selfish guy as I am living on other people\'s money and almost disowned me. I know he didn\'t and I wish he did. \n\nI don\'t mean to sit on my ass and play township all day eating sleeping and shitting forever. I wish I could be on my own. But the thought of life scares me. I hate the field I\'m semi qualified for. I fucked up the final exams after wasting an year including the lockdown and postponement of exams last year. I tried to find a way out of this field but all my ""unrealistic"" ideas didn\'t seem to work. I thought I could become a part time teacher as I always liked to teach. But my brother who is a very successful and know it all genius of the family pointed out that teachers are already jobless and I am a stupid idiot who would fail his students as he can\'t even get himself to pass an exam. I can\'t become a writer coz that requires some intelligence which I don\'t have. I can\'t run a business of my own as I am broke and I would fail that too. I can\'t do anything else. I am stuck and keep going down this quicksand pit. \n\nEven if I suck it up and get a job in the audit field, what am I gonna do? I would be replaced by someon who is actually resourceful in a matter of no time. Even if I become good in my job, what next? Work for 60 hours a week for the next 30 years on something that drives me crazy? Get married for the sake of family? Get a bunch of kids snd add their well being and education into the list of my ever expanding troubles? Make connections with people I don\'t like for the sake of social status? Why is that life for anyway? \n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? Everyone else seems to be enjoying this godforsaken way of life that has sslaved us to our luxuries and  social status. Why can\'t I suck it up and become a zombie and do whatever I\'m told to? Why is my brain not able to get the message? \n\nI have been noticed by teachers and friends to have signs of ADHD sibce school days. But my family who don\'t believe in mental illness knows better. They know that I\'m a lazy awkward idiot who didn\'t learn to focus his thoughts and is still immature and can\'t handle being a MAN as my brother is. \n\nI know there\'s a million quotes about ""we can live the life we want and nobody can stop us"" or ""Work hard and be successful"" shit. But whst is the point in all of that if I ultimately despise the fucking life itself?\n\nWhat is the point to anything? Am I in hell? Is this the way I get tortured for eternity? I got molested by my aunt\'s sister when I was 7 and my  brother when I was 8. Both of them were also underage during that time. So they dropped their load on me. At least I didn\'t molest anyone to satisfy my curiosity. I just learned masturbation when I was 10 and did it like 4 times a day until I turned 25. I developed a craving for pleasure even before I knew what it is. I am still suffering fighting hard to control my thoughts. \n\nI dropped out of school when I was 13 and put back in school at 19. Worked my way through without thinking about what I really want and went on with what my family thought would be good for my future. Well that\'s what you get being born in a dysfunctional family and having mental illness. I am suffering from depression and anxiety for the last 6 years. Well everyone else thinks that I\'m lazy and moody. Maybe that is what i am. \n\nI am a useless piece of garbage. No even garbage can be recycled or turned into manure or something. I am just a waste of a life being a burden on everyone adding carbon dioxide to the earth. \n\nI have tried several times to take myself out the last few weeks. Hanging myself, drowning myself, falling from the 3rd floor on to the road below, hanging again. But. i just can\'t go through it. I can\'t live, I can\'t die. Story of my life is nothing but waste of time and resources. \n\nI wish I could just go through it. A few seconds of pain is enough. I would dir and the world would be a better place.\n\nFor fuck sake give me a heart attack or something. Haven\'t I had enough? What more fucked up shit is shead for me?\n\nHindu mythology says hell is filled with torture methods like boiling pas of oil and fire to torture the bad people. I used to believe that. But now I understand hell is life. Hell is what I am in right now. My own mind that is tormenting me and giving me hope so that it can torment me more. \n\nI WISH I NEVER EXISTED.

65,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation?

84,"Am I faking my depression?. Ok so for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days. My home life isnt that good. Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything.

85,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"attempt

86,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it.

Hello, in the last few months i became pretty okay with sucide, i'm not afraid of death really, i already have a plan and all the reasons, but i feel like i shouldn't leave yet because of the potential guilt i would feel if i leave others. I'm currently living for other people and don't really see a brighter future for myself so it's just a matter of time when i will stop giving a fuck about others as well. I was wondering if there is someone else with similar situation and what is stopping you from offing yourself? Telling your loved ones about it. I decided that it's my time to go, i'm not asking for support or anything, i am sure about this decision but i'm asking you how can i tell my family that it's my final decision and nothing will change my mind? I'm going to starve myself to death because i'm dealing with lots of issues that can't really be solved. I'm 20 years old and my parents are pushing me to live more and don't really understand the situation. They will probably keep telling me to eat which is only natural to say if you care about someone but i've made up my mind. So another question, can they force me to eat if i end up in hospital or drug me? Thanks. I got a question. Does anybody have any experience or knowledge with starvation/VSED?
