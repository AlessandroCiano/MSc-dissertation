1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"indicator

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses deep distress (""inconsolable"") and a belief about impending death (""I'm going to die soon""), but it **lacks explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, a plan, methods, or past actions**. The statement about dying could imply hopelessness or fatalism without directly referencing a desire to end one's own life. According to the definitions:  
- **Indicator** applies when there is no explicit suicidal intent, even with strong negative emotions or vague references to death.  
- **Ideation/Behavior/Attempt** require explicit expressions of suicidal desire, plans, methods, or past actions—none of which are present here.",indicator,True
2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"indicator

The post expresses strong dissatisfaction with life (""I hate living"") and questions the purpose of existence, but contains **no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts**. The phrase ""think about why I have to live"" focuses on existential frustration rather than a stated desire to die or end one's life. According to the definitions, general expressions of distress without explicit suicidal content belong to the ""indicator"" category.",indicator,True

The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""i still want to die,"" ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"") and recurrent thoughts about suicide (""constantly thinking about how nothing matters""). However, it does **not** mention a specific plan, method, preparation, or past suicide attempt.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to end life (""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it,"" ""I want it to stop"") and intense emotional pain driving suicidal thoughts. However, it **lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, location, or preparatory action** (e.g., weapons, notes, or concrete steps).

The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I want to call it a day and kill myself"", ""I want to die now"") **and** mentions specific methods/plans for suicide:  
1. ""run towards a cop with a knife"" (method: suicide by cop using a weapon)  
2. ""find a dealer with some opioids"" (method: overdose on drugs).

The post expresses a clear desire to end life (""I just want to get it over with"") and directly references going through with suicide (""if I go through with it""), which fits the **ideation** definition: explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without detailing a specific plan or method. While fear of pain implies consideration of methods, no actual plan (means, location, tools) is described.

But if you can, please temme how because I am sick and tried of crying myself to slee every night.",1,ideation,"Based on the definitions provided, the post belongs to the category: **ideation**.

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Explicit Expression of Suicidal Desire:** The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon..."". This clearly expresses a desire to not be alive and directly mentions killing oneself.
2.  **Absence of Specific Plan or Behavior:** While the author mentions a timeframe (""5 more years""), there is no mention of a *specific method* (e.g., pills, hanging, jumping), *location*, *means* (e.g., stockpiling pills, buying a rope), or *preparations taken*. The timeframe is a general thought about timing, not a plan detailing how the act would be carried out.
3.  **Not a Past Attempt:** The post discusses current feelings and a future possibility, not a past action taken to end their life.
4.  **Distress vs. Explicit Suicide Mention:** The expressions of self-hatred, job/family dissatisfaction, isolation, and hopelessness are severe indicators of distress, but the key classification factor is the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts (""I want to die"", ""kill myself"") without a specific plan.

Therefore, the post fits the definition of **Ideation**: explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or desires without a specific plan.",ideation,True

I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to.

The post explicitly mentions a specific suicide method (""I've considered hanging""), which falls under the **Behavior** category definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... [including] a specific method."" The reference to hanging as a means qualifies as explicit planning, distinguishing it from general ideation. While the author states they ""can't seem to go through with it,"" the articulation of the method meets the threshold for Behavior.

**Reasoning:**  
- Explicit suicidal intent: ""i'm going to kill myself.""  
- Mentions preparatory actions: ""i already got my suicidal notes ready"" (qualifies as explicit planning under 'behavior' definition).  
- References method/planning: ""a matter of when and how"" (though vague, combined with notes confirms behavior).

**Explanation:** The post expresses intense self-loathing, body image issues, and a desire to escape one's identity (""wish I could press a button and be someone else""). However, it **lacks any explicit mention of suicide, death, wanting to die, self-harm, plans, methods, or past attempts**.

The post discusses other people potentially posting about suicide, but the author **themselves** expresses no personal suicidal thoughts, plans, behaviors, or past attempts. The content is analytical and opinion-based (""what do you hope to gain?"", ""in my opinion""), focusing on the motivations of others.

The post expresses intense distress, fear, and feelings of being overwhelmed (""I'm going insane,"" ""too much,"" ""so fucking scared""). However, there is **no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts**.

- References to ""have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral"" express intent but **do not constitute actionable planning** under the ""behavior"" criteria.

This meets the ""Ideation"" definition: explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire not to be alive) without mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt.

While no method is named, the confirmed intent with a temporal plan moves it beyond Ideation.

It references a **past opportunity** (""6 months ago"") but clarifies no actual attempt occurred (""I was a pussy""). There is **no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or active self-harm behavior** related to current suicidal thoughts.

- **Explicit desire to die** = Suicidal ideation (fulfills ""ideation"" definition)

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,indicator,indicator,True
35,"Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?. Today's my birthday. I feel hollow. Everyone expects happiness and joy. I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"Ideation

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to cease existing (""I just want to not exist"") and references escaping unbearable reality through an ""illusion land,"" indicating active suicidal thoughts. However, there is **no mention of a plan, method, timeline, or preparatory actions** (e.g., weapons, locations, notes). Metaphorical references to self-destruction (""kill myself working"") are non-literal. While intense distress and hopelessness are present, the criteria for ""ideation"" are met due to the explicit wish to not be alive, without advancing to actionable intent or behavior.",ideation,True

The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""i wish i could just fucking end it,"" ""subjectively it would be better if i was dead"") and a desire not to be alive. While a method (taking pills) is mentioned, it's immediately dismissed due to fear and pain concerns (""i'm just too scared,"" ""i don't want to die in pain""), showing it's a contemplated idea rather than a specific plan or preparation. No past attempts are described. This fits the 'ideation' definition: explicit expressions of suicidal desire without a concrete plan or preparatory behavior.",ideation,True
38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back.

The post explicitly mentions a specific suicide date (""This Friday, May 14, 2021"") and implies urgency (""either that day or before it""). This constitutes a concrete plan, aligning with the **behavior** category definition: explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts coupled with planning (specified timing). While past attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts"") are noted, the **primary focus** is the imminent plan, and the category rules state that explicit planning supersedes past attempts when both are present. The mention of methods is implied through the declaration of intent and timeframe, meeting the threshold for behavior.",behavior,True

No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey.

- The post explicitly states ""I can't live anymore,"" indicating a direct desire to cease living, which aligns with the **ideation** definition (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan).  
- Phrases like ""non painful way to do this"" are vague and do not detail a method, location, or preparation, so they do not qualify as **behavior**.

Explanation: The post expresses profound distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (""i'm always tired,"" ""life is so cyclic,"" ""it's so lonely""). Phrases like ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" suggest despair but lack explicit mention of suicide, dying, or self-harm.

Explanation:  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to end life (""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go"") and references imminent action (""in the near future""). However, it lacks any mention of specific methods, locations, tools, or preparations (e.g., weapons, notes, locations).

1. The post references past suicidal feelings (""**found out i was suicidal**""), but does **not** describe a specific past action taken to attempt suicide (required for ""Attempt"").  
2. There is **no expression of current suicidal thoughts**, plans, methods, or behaviors. The focus is on recounting a past experience with inadequate support.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""Should I just go and kill myself?"", ""Might as well just die""), indicating a desire to end life. However, there is **no mention of a specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparatory actions** (e.g., weapons, notes, or concrete steps).

The post explicitly states ""I had made up my mind to kill myself"" (explicit suicidal desire) and crucially includes ""I have prepared everything,"" indicating concrete preparations for suicide. According to the definitions:
- Explicit suicidal thoughts place it beyond Indicator
- Mention of preparations (""prepared everything"") qualifies as suicidal behavior, moving it beyond Ideation
- No description of past suicide attempts exists, ruling out Attempt

Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore .

The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I wanna off myself,"" ""I don't even wanna live anymore"") indicating a desire to die. However, it contains no mention of a specific suicide plan, method, preparation, or past attempt.

The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts with phrases like ""suicidal"" and ""tonight's the night I guess,"" indicating a current desire to die. However, it does not mention any specific plan, method (e.g., tools, location), or preparations for suicide. The expression of hopelessness and isolation supports distress but does not escalate it to ""behavior"" without concrete planning details. Past attempts are not referenced.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly discusses a specific method for suicide (""cutting an artery"") and explores means to facilitate it (""taking oxy"" to lessen pain). This constitutes planning (tools and method), fitting the **behavior** category definition:  
> *""mentions a plan to commit suicide... specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs, tools suitable to end one's life)""*.  
Though phrased as a question, the detailed focus on methodology exceeds ideation. No past actions are described, ruling out ""attempt"".",ideation,True
70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"indicator

The post expresses distress and hurt feelings due to a friend's comment about the author potentially dying by suicide, but the author never personally expresses:
- Current or past suicidal thoughts (ideation)
- Any plan or preparation for suicide (behavior)
- Past suicide attempts (attempt)

The focus is entirely on the emotional impact of the friend's words, managing the relationship, and seeking validation about their reaction. Mentions of suicide are attributed to the friend's perspective (""she thinks I'm going to kill myself"") and presented as hurtful assumptions, not as expressions of the author's own state. General statements about fighting mental illness and feeling upset don't meet the threshold for ideation, behavior, or attempt under the definitions.",indicator,True

**Reasoning:**  
The post explicitly states a plan to commit suicide by specifying the method (""overdose on iron pills""). This meets the **behavior** category definition, which includes expressions of suicidal thoughts coupled with a specific plan or method (e.g., lethal medication). The phrase ""gonna"" indicates intent for future action, not a past attempt. General distress (""pain everyday"") and hopelessness are present, but the explicit plan elevates it beyond ideation.",ideation,True

The post explicitly states ""im going to kill myself one day,"" expressing a clear desire to end their life. While they describe intense distress, hopelessness, and a wish to ""disappear"" or ""run away to a forest and fucking die,"" **no specific suicide method, plan, location, preparations, or means are mentioned**.

The post expresses a strong desire to escape life and cease existing (""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""My soul is hurting, I don't think I can do it anymore,"" ""starting to want to wave the white flag""), which constitutes explicit suicidal ideation.

The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life.

The post explicitly states **""I don't deserve, nor want to live""**, which is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive. This fulfills the criteria for **Ideation** (explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method).

No specific suicide methods, preparations, locations, or timelines are mentioned. The wish to ""donate my life"" is metaphorical, not a concrete plan. There are no references to past suicide attempts.

Explanation: The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon"") and includes self-destructive actions (stopping medications, quitting therapy, embracing unhealthy habits).

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses intense emotional distress (""broken remainings of my soul,"" ""free from all this pain"") and a desire to ""disappear,"" but it **lacks any explicit mention of suicide, dying, or wanting to end life**. The language is metaphorical and focuses on escaping pain rather than expressing active suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.  
- **Indicator Criteria Met**: General distress/hopelessness without explicit suicidal intent.

The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"") and specifically mentions planning (""I just need a plan for suicide""). According to the category definitions:
- **Behavior** requires explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts **and** mention of a plan or preparations.
- The phrase ""I just need a plan for suicide"" constitutes explicit reference to planning, moving it beyond ideation (which lacks a plan) into the behavior category.",ideation,True

I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"attempt

Explanation: The post explicitly references a past suicide attempt (""my most recent failed attempt""). While it also includes expressions of current suicidal thoughts (""I'm going to kill myself"") and self-harm urges (""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly""), the specific mention of a **past concrete suicide attempt** (""stayed in the car"" relating to the attempt) directly triggers the 'attempt' category according to the rules.

The post explicitly states ""I'd rather kill myself now"" which directly expresses a desire to end one's life. This meets the definition of **Ideation** since:
1. There's an explicit suicidal thought (""kill myself"")
2. No specific plan, method, location, or preparatory actions are mentioned
3. It describes a current desire to die rather than a past attempt

While the phrase ""now"" implies urgency, it doesn't constitute a concrete plan as required for the ""behavior"" category. The core classification remains ideation due to the absence of actionable details about suicide methods or preparations.",ideation,True

I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job.

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and passive thoughts about escaping life (e.g., *""things would be better if I didn’t have to try anymore""*). However, it **explicitly denies current suicidal intent** (*""I don’t think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen""*) and lacks any mention of:  
- A desire to die or end life (required for *ideation*),  
- Specific plans, methods, or preparations (required for *behavior*),  
- Past suicide attempts (required for *attempt*).

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" multiple times and describes their intensification (""get stronger and stronger""). It expresses a desire to escape life (""i just want to collapse and let go"") but includes **no reference to a specific plan, method, preparation, or past suicide attempt**. The distress and hopelessness are clear, but the absence of concrete suicidal plans or behaviors aligns with the **ideation** category.",ideation,True

1. The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"").
2. It includes a plan by specifying the timeframe (""tonight"").

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly mentions **practicing hanging** as a method, indicating specific preparations (""*I've been practicing hanging myself*,"" ""*I'm going to keep practicing, train myself*"").  
- It references **overcoming survival instinct** and **planning to succeed**, confirming active engagement in behavioral steps toward suicide.  
- While expressing intense suicidal ideation (e.g., ""*deserves to die*,"" ""*thinking of death makes me happy*""), the inclusion of **method-specific actions** (hanging) and **rehearsal** exceeds ideation and aligns with the ""behavior"" category’s requirement of explicit planning/preparation.

**Explanation:**

Explanation: The post expresses distress, hopelessness (""I don't want to exist""), and dissatisfaction with life, but explicitly denies suicidal thoughts (""I'm not suicidal or something"") and states suicide is selfish. There is no mention of a desire to die, suicidal plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts. While phrases like ""don't want to exist"" suggest deep distress, they lack explicit suicidal intent required for 'ideation' according to the definitions. General expressions of hopelessness without explicit suicidal desire fall under 'indicator'.",indicator,True
94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."". (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness. For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,attempt,attempt,True

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"Based on the definitions and the post content:

The post explicitly details **past suicide attempts**:
- Taking multiple bottles of sleeping pills at age 16 (resulting in hospitalization)
- Cutting their neck with a razor in November 2020
- Overdosing on prescription medication in November 2020

These descriptions meet the **Attempt** category definition: ""*The content describes past attempts at suicide*"" and ""*A concrete action need to have happened in the past*"". The motorcycle incident is ambiguous regarding intent, but the three explicitly stated suicide attempts dominate the narrative.

While current distress (""*I don't want to live at all*"") is present, the category focuses on documented past actions. The note also specifies: ""*when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'*"".

The post explicitly states ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good,"" indicating both suicidal intent and a specific timeframe (April) for execution.

The post explicitly mentions specific methods of self-harm: ""get hit by a car or od on meds"". The reference to overdosing on medication (""od on meds"") constitutes an explicit suicidal method, aligning with the ""Behavior"" category definition where specific means/methods (e.g., lethal medication) are mentioned.

- No reference to past suicide actions exists, so **Attempt** does not apply.  
- While ""take the leap"" could metaphorically imply action, it is not a concrete plan description. Per guidelines, ambiguity defaults to **Ideation** over Behavior.

On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. It's mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!. With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"indicator

Explanation: The post describes severe bullying and harassment directed at the friend, including statements like ""go kill yourself"" made *by the bully*. However, the friend's reactions (feeling overwhelmed, tired, not eating) indicate distress without any explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts from the friend herself. The suicidal language is quoted from the harasser, not expressed by the subject (the friend). The friend's distress falls under general hopelessness without explicit suicidal intent, fitting the ""indicator"" category.",indicator,True

Explanation:
The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""I want to hang myself so bad"") indicating a desire to die. While a specific method (hanging) is mentioned, there is no description of planning, preparation, or imminent action. The key distinction from 'behavior' is the absence of concrete steps toward implementation (e.g., acquiring materials or setting a timeframe). The presence of ongoing thoughts without actionable plans aligns with the 'ideation' category. References to ""holding on"" due to hope further indicate contemplation rather than active preparation.",ideation,True

I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting and I know this is going to be another failure, I'm still too scared to go all the way through. I know I'll wake up later, and while I know this, I want so badly to reach out to my friends and ask them to check up on me but I don't want to put them through something as scary as this. I don't want them to have to deal with me during this. I knew this morning the moment I woke up that it would lead to this. I've thought about it all day and throughout I've tried to be happy and loud so they wouldn't worry, so they wouldn't know what I was really thinking. I'm scared right now but I know I'll wake up. I'm sad right now and I want nothing more than someone to sit with me in silence while I cry. But I'm alone. I can't reach out. So all I ask is this, please check up on me later. I can feel myself falling asleep, but as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up. I just want to be checked up on, but I don't want to bother my friends with it. Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.",0,indicator,"indicator

**Reasoning:**  
- The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, and passive thoughts about not waking up (""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"").  
- It references past experiences of similar states (""as I've done this before"") but **does not describe a past suicide attempt** (e.g., no mention of overdose, cutting, or other methods).  
- There are **no explicit expressions of suicidal desire** (e.g., ""I want to die/kill myself"").  
- There is **no mention of a plan, method, or preparatory actions** (e.g., pills, weapons, notes).  
- Phrases like ""end of my rope"" and ""too scared to go all the way through"" imply emotional overwhelm but **lack direct suicidal intent**, aligning with the ""indicator"" definition of vague distress without explicit suicidal ideation.  

The content fits the ""indicator"" category due to the absence of explicit suicidal desire, plan, or description of past attempts.",indicator,True

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses distress, substance misuse (stealing prescription hydrocodone and drinking), and feeling ""not ok,"" but **there is no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts**. Key points:  
- Mentions stealing medication ""to feel ok for one night"" (coping, not self-harm/suicide).  
- States hopelessness (""not sure what to do"") but no desire to die.  
- No references to suicide, death, self-harm, or methods.

131,31/m - I see no point in living anymore. I don't have any friends. Nothing in my life is working out,0,indicator,"ideation

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly states ""I see no point in living anymore,"" which directly expresses a desire to not be alive. This aligns with the **Ideation** definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan."" There is no mention of methods, preparations, past actions, or self-harm, ruling out ""behavior"" and ""attempt."" The specificity of ""no point in living"" exceeds general distress (indicator) by explicitly rejecting continued existence.",indicator,True

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"attempt  
**Reasoning**: The post explicitly states ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow,"" indicating a **completed action of self-harm** (ingesting pills) with an anticipated lethal outcome. This meets the 'attempt' definition: describing a past/current concrete suicidal action (overdose) rather than ideation or planning. The phrase ""might not wake up"" confirms the act has already occurred and consequences are pending, aligning with historic/active suicidal behavior. No future plan or vague ideation is present—only a reported action.",ideation,True

I'm tired of the constant struggle and have a fear of failing an attempt once again. I intend to do it right this time and not make those around me suffer with the blatant telling of my suicidal thoughts. I will not usher my burden into anyone else and will just silently reminisce with these feelings and my thoughts.

For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born.,1,ideation,"ideation

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire not to live (""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore,"" ""I hate being alive"") and references suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""wonder if I should just do it""). However, it includes **no specific plan, method, preparation, or self-harming behavior**. The hesitation due to fear and potential impact on others reinforces the absence of actionable intent. This aligns with the **Ideation** definition: explicit suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan.",ideation,True
135,"i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die. Does anyone else do this?",3,attempt,"behavior  
The post explicitly describes current suicidal behavior with specific methods (""hang myself"") and preparatory elements (""leave a chair or elevated object""). This constitutes active planning and partial enactment of suicide, aligning with the 'behavior' category. While framed as non-fatal attempts, the recurring practice of lethal methods with controlled risk still demonstrates concrete suicidal actions in the present context.",behavior,True

I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice.

**Reasoning:**  
The post explicitly states current suicidal thoughts (""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"") without describing a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The mention of a past attempt (""I had an attempt when I was 14"") falls under the **Attempt** category, but the definitions specify:  
> *""When a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""*  
Here, the current expressions (""I don't want to go on anymore"") constitute **ideation** (desire to die without a plan), not a current *plan*. No methods, tools, locations, or preparatory actions for imminent suicide are mentioned. Thus, the active risk is **Ideation**.",ideation,True

- The post explicitly states: ""I've been having some thoughts... telling me to **end it all**.""

- There is **no mention** of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past suicide attempt.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all?

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, self-loathing, and intrusive violent thoughts (e.g., thoughts of harming others or desiring trauma/illness). The metaphor about a sick dog being ""put down"" alludes to a passive wish for death but does **not** explicitly state a desire for suicide, a specific plan, or a past attempt. Key points:  
- No explicit phrases like ""I want to die/kill myself,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""suicide.""  
- The dog metaphor is indirect and lacks concrete suicidal intent or methods.  
- Mentions of self-harm are absent; violent thoughts are directed outward (hurting others).  
- General hopelessness (""Nothing's real,"" ""I'm an abomination"") fits **Indicator**, as no suicidal ideation/plan/attempt is explicitly stated.

Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath.

The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being trapped (e.g., ""i want it to stop and if i leave them i have no one""). However, there is **no explicit mention** of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts. Phrases like ""he would be better off without me"" suggest low self-worth but do not explicitly state a desire to die or end one's life. General dissatisfaction with relationships and emotional pain fall under ""indicator"" per the guidelines, as suicidal intent must be explicit to warrant a higher category.",indicator,True

The post expresses intense anger, despair, hopelessness, and trauma (""i'm so tired,"" ""the world is just fucked,"" ""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED""). However, there is **no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts**. The statement ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours"" is directed at another person (wishing they weren't alive), not the author themselves.

I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"ideation

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself"").  
- It mentions a vague timeframe (""tomorrow"") but **lacks any specific plan details** (methods, tools, locations, or preparations).  
- References to being ""too weak and pathetic to do it"" imply contemplation without actionable intent or preparation.  
- While ""tomorrow"" suggests timing, it does not constitute a concrete plan as defined in the ""behavior"" category (e.g., no means/methods specified).  
- No past suicide attempts are described.  
- Fits the **Ideation** definition: explicit desire to end life without a specific plan.",ideation,True

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"Based on the definitions:

The phrase ""yeet myself"" is a common euphemism for suicide/self-harm, explicitly expressing **a desire to end one's life**. The post describes ongoing sadness and hopelessness (""dead inside,"" ""beyond saving"") and directly states this desire (""I just want to... yeet myself way too much""). 

However, it **does not mention**:
- A specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping)
- Preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note)
- A location or time
- Any past suicide attempts

This meets the criteria for **Ideation**: Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desires (""yeet myself"" = desire to end life) without any mention of a specific plan or behavior. General distress and hopelessness support the context, but the explicit suicidal desire is key.

Explanation: The post explicitly states ""I just wanna kill myself,"" which clearly expresses a desire to end one's life. However, it does **not** mention any specific suicide method, plan, preparation, or past attempt. This fits the definition of **Ideation** (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts... without any specific plan"").

The post explicitly states ""planning to commit suicide"" and ""have no choice but to end it,"" expressing a clear desire to die. However, there is no mention of specific methods, locations, tools, preparations, or timelines for carrying out suicide. The word ""planning"" here reflects a general intention rather than concrete actionable steps (which would require details like means/methods to qualify as 'behavior').

Since there is explicit suicidal desire without a described plan, it falls under:

**Category: Ideation**  

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""going through with attempting suicide,"" ""so close to attempting suicide"") as an alternative to moving home.  
- There is **no description of a specific plan, method, or preparation** (e.g., tools, location, timing) for suicide.  
- References to past actions (""was so close"") describe **contemplation, not an actual attempt** (no action occurred; they texted their mother instead).  
- While distress and hopelessness are present, the explicit desire to die moves it beyond ""indicator,"" and the absence of concrete plans or past suicide actions excludes ""behavior"" and ""attempt.""

**Explanation:**  
- The post expresses intense distress (""pain makes me want to scream,"" ""excruciating"") and hopelessness (""I cant take it""), but **explicitly denies suicidal intent** (""I wont kill myself of course"").  
- No explicit desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts are mentioned.

The post expresses significant distress about gender dysphoria, societal pressures, and dissatisfaction with appearance/life circumstances. However, there is **no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, death, self-harm, plans, methods, or past attempts**. The language focuses on identity struggles and emotional pain without referencing a desire to die or end one's life. Per the definitions:  
- General dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal intent falls under **indicator**.  
- No phrases like ""want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" or references to suicide methods/plans exist.  
- Vague distress alone does not qualify as *ideation*, *behavior*, or *attempt*.",indicator,True

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to end life (""I wish I had the courage to end it all"") but does not mention any specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt.

Explanation: The post explicitly states ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide,"" which describes a past concrete action to end their life. This meets the 'attempt' definition (""historic actions rather than current plans""). While current suicidal consideration (""i still consider"") is mentioned, the category note specifies: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The absence of specific current plans/methods prevents classification as 'behavior'.",behavior,True

- It focuses on suicidal thoughts and seeking companionship in suicide, which aligns with the **Ideation** definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan.""

**Explanation:** The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""I want to kms,"" ""can't stop thinking about killing myself"") and details **specific preparatory actions**: possessing a rope, practicing hanging (""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung""), and referencing preparations like packing their apartment. These actions constitute explicit planning and behavior per the definition of ""behavior"" (mentions tools/methods and rehearsals).

The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more"") and references suicidal thoughts driven by distress (e.g., ""this job has been making me violently suicidal,"" ""my suicidal ideation""). However, while the author mentions considering a gun (""I’ve always thought I was going to get a gun""), there is **no specific plan, method, preparation, or timeline** described. The uncertainty (""I don’t know how exactly I’m going to do it"") and lack of concrete actionable steps align with the **ideation** category.

The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""now I want to die more than ever"") which constitutes suicidal ideation according to the definition: explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without mention of a specific plan, method, or preparatory actions. There is no indication of past attempts, self-harm, or planning (methods/locations/tools), ruling out ""attempt"" and ""behavior"".

The post explicitly states ""i just wanna end it,"" which directly expresses a desire to die or commit suicide without mentioning any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the **ideation** category definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""end it"" is a clear idiom for suicide, and there are no references to methods, locations, or past attempts.",ideation,True
187,"Consider going hobo. Hi people. I just want to point out the alternative for anyone on the brink of suicide. There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant. Living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes, begging or stealing to keep fed. Its not a great situation, but on both occasions it was better than the predicaments that preceded it. And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"indicator

**Reasoning:**  
- The post discusses past distress where the author felt unable to cope and mentions being ""on the brink of suicide"" as a generalized scenario for others.  
- However, the author explicitly states they chose an alternative (becoming homeless) rather than acting on suicidal thoughts. Phrases like ""the road has saved me"" and ""it's a comfort to know it's there"" frame homelessness as a coping strategy, not a suicidal plan.  
- There is **no explicit expression of the author's personal desire to die**, specific suicidal plans, methods, or past suicide attempts. Distress and hopelessness are present, but without explicit suicidal intent, per the definitions, this falls under ""indicator"".",indicator,True

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to end life (""end it""), which meets the definition of **ideation**. While it mentions timing (""tonight""), it does **not** specify a method, location, tools, or concrete preparations for suicide. Without these explicit planning elements, it remains in the ""ideation"" category per the guidelines (unsure → choose 'ideation' over 'behavior').",ideation,True

1. **Explicit expression of suicidal intent**: The post directly asks ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" – confirming active suicidal desire.  
2. **Specific plan/method disclosed**: Mentions possession of 800mg codeine and ibuprofen, and asks about their lethality given physical characteristics (56kg weight). This constitutes preparation and evaluation of a concrete method.  

The combination of suicidal intent + specific means assessment meets the **Behavior** threshold (""explicit planning like a specific method"" and ""lethal medication/drugs"").

**Category: ideation**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Explicit suicidal desire is present:** The post contains direct expressions like ""resisting the desire to end"" and ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" clearly indicating a desire not to be alive.
2. **No specific plan or method is mentioned:** While the distress and desire to die are explicit, there is no mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparations for suicide.
3. **No past attempt is described:** The post discusses ongoing suffering and a desire to end life, but does not reference any past concrete suicide actions.
4. **Exceeds ""indicator"":** The explicit statements about the ""desire to end"" and lack of reasons to stay alive move it beyond general distress or hopelessness into explicit suicidal ideation.

**Reasoning:**  
The post explicitly states ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself,"" which directly expresses suicidal thoughts (desire to end life). However, it lacks any mention of a specific suicide plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. Phrases like ""I wanna see my daughters grow up"" further indicate conflicted feelings without concrete plans.

The post expresses general distress and dissatisfaction (""i'm not okay right now"") and mentions a vague feeling about dying (""maybe I don't need to die""), but there is no explicit expression of:
- Current suicidal thoughts or desire to die (ruling out ideation)
- Any plan, method, or preparation for suicide (ruling out behavior)
- Past suicide attempts (ruling out attempt)

**Explanation:** The post explicitly mentions a specific method (""plummet to the ground"") and location (""highest floor"") for suicide, satisfying the criteria for the 'behavior' category.

The post explicitly mentions a specific suicidal plan: repeatedly going to a hospital parking garage ledge with the intent to jump (method: jumping, location: hospital parking garage).

I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online.

The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts: ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger..."" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life..."". While it also mentions current suicidal thoughts (""my death seems to be the ultimate answer"") and research into methods (""searching about ways to kill myself""), the category definitions specify: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"".

Explanation: The post expresses deep distress, hopelessness (""done with everything""), and feeling ""more dead inside,"" but there is no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts.

The post explicitly mentions ""writing suicide notes,"" which qualifies as preparatory behavior under the 'behavior' category (suicide note preparation is specified in the definition).

Explanation: The post expresses a direct desire to die (""hope i die"") which constitutes explicit suicidal ideation according to the definition. While it contains intense emotional distress and hopelessness, there is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts.

Explanation: The post explicitly states ""i kinda just wanna die"" which expresses a direct desire to end life, fitting the 'ideation' definition of suicidal thoughts without mentioning any specific plan, method, or preparation.

I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly states ""I've been having suicidal thoughts"" and ""thinking about partially planning to die,"" which directly expresses a desire to end life.

**Explanation:** The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""i'm an ugly useless stupid girl who is better off dead,"" ""too scared to end it"") and includes a specific plan: ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself."" This details both a method (hanging) and a location (remote mountains), meeting the 'behavior' definition.

**Explanation:**  
- The post explicitly states ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts,"" which directly expresses a **desire to die**.  
- There is **no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt**. Phrases like ""I don't know what else to try"" and ""tired of all of it"" reflect hopelessness but lack actionable suicidal planning.

The post expresses distress, depression, anxiety, and hopelessness (""fucked up self,"" ""don't even have the motivation to get up"").

**Explanation:**  
- The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and a desire to suppress them, fitting the **ideation** definition (expressing suicidal thoughts/desires without a specific plan).  
- While a method (eye drops) is referenced, it is framed as a passive ""idea"" rather than an active plan or preparation. No details about timing, location, or concrete steps indicate planning.  
- The definition states: If unsure whether there is an explicit plan, choose **ideation** over behavior. Here, the method is hypothetical, not actionable.  
- No past suicide attempts are described, ruling out **attempt**.  
- Explicit suicidal thoughts disqualify **indicator**.",indicator,True

I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them.

The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness (""stain upon the world""), isolation, and the belief the world wouldn't change if the poster were gone. However, it lacks any explicit expression of a desire to die, thoughts of suicide, a plan, or a past attempt. The statement ""the world would not change at all if I were gone"" reflects profound feelings of insignificance and despair, but does not explicitly state a wish to end their life or engage in suicidal behavior.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused.

**Category: indicator**

**Reasoning:**  
- The post expresses intense anger, distress, hopelessness (""trying to hold on to whatever I have left""), and feeling neglected.  
- It references societal stigma around suicide (""attention seeking"") and hypothetical death (""they won’t believe it until I die"").  
- **Crucially, there is no explicit expression of current suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die""), plans, methods, or past attempts.** Mentions of death are contextualized as others' hypothetical reactions, not the author's intent.  
- While phrases like ""ended it silently"" reference suicide abstractly, they criticize others' views rather than state the author’s own desire or plans.  
- The distress falls under general dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal ideation/behavior per the definitions.",indicator,True

So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them.

The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""wanna kill myself,"" ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"") but does not describe a specific, actionable plan, method, or preparation. The mention of a discarded suicide note indicates past behavior, but the primary focus is on current desires to die without concrete steps.

The post expresses deep despair, hopelessness, and farewells (""I've got nothing left,"" ""The end is the only thing that feels right now""). However, it contains **no explicit mention of suicide, dying, self-harm, or a desire to end life**. Phrases like ""the end"" imply finality but lack specificity about suicide.

**Explanation:** The post explicitly states a desire to end life (""shut every thought down"") and specifies a lethal method (""cutting my god damn throat"").

The post expresses hopelessness (""Life is useless"") and discusses death/suicide in a generalized, conceptual manner (""Death and suicide need to be normalized""). While the word ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned, it is used in an abstract societal context rather than expressing a **personal desire to die or end one's own life**. There is no statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I plan to kill myself,"" nor any reference to personal suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts. The tone is philosophical rather than self-referential, aligning with the ""indicator"" category (general distress without explicit personal suicidal intent).",indicator,True

The post romanticizes death and cessation of pain (""never feel pain,"" ""let go"") but contains **no explicit expression of suicidal intent, plan, or past attempt**.

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses deep emotional distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being trapped in pain (e.g., ""I am here to live in pain,"" ""The pain will never loosen its grip""). However, there is **no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts**. References to ""never die"" and ""never be free"" are metaphorical expressions of suffering, not literal desires for death. General statements about deserving suffering or questioning one's destiny do not meet the threshold for *ideation*, *behavior*, or *attempt* under the given definitions. Thus, it fits the **indicator** category.",indicator,True
251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"Based on the definitions and the post content:

Explanation:  
The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago""). This meets the ""Attempt"" definition, which focuses on historic actions. While the post also includes current passive thoughts about death (e.g., ""the idea of that state lasting forever is hard to turn away from""), these lack a specific plan and are outweighed by the clear reference to a past attempt. The note under ""Attempt"" specifies that if a post references past attempts, it should be labeled as such, even if current plans are mentioned.",attempt,True

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"Based on the definitions:

1.  **Explicit Expression of Suicidal Desire:** The post explicitly states ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" This clearly expresses a current desire to die/commit suicide.
2.  **Specific Plan or Behavior?** The post details past self-destructive behavior (misuse of painkillers/paracetamol leading to physical harm and addiction, starvation). However, it describes these as *past* coping mechanisms and consequences, not as a *current plan or preparation* for suicide. There is no mention of a specific method, tool, location, or actionable plan for carrying out suicide *now*.
3.  **Past Attempt?** While the past medication misuse caused harm, it is framed as coping/self-medication leading to unintended consequences (addiction, organ damage), not as a deliberate past attempt to end life. There is no description of an action taken with the *intent* to die.

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit expressions of a current desire to die (""end it""), fulfilling the core requirement for **Ideation**. While it details past harmful behaviors, these do not constitute a current plan (Behavior) or a past suicide attempt (Attempt).

- There is **no specific plan, method, or preparation** described (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or actions taken to attempt suicide).  
- Fear of failure (*""botching it""*) and consequences (being hospitalized) are deterrents, but these do not constitute a concrete plan.

- There are no references to suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, acquiring tools).

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly states ""I want to die,"" which qualifies as suicidal ideation.  
- It specifies a method: ""pull the trigger"" (firearm use), which meets the **Behavior** category definition of mentioning a specific means (guns/weapons).  
- No past suicide attempt is described, ruling out ""attempt.""  
- The inclusion of a concrete method (""pull the trigger"") moves it beyond vague ideation into **Behavior**, per the guidelines.",ideation,True

**Behavior**  
*(Reasoning: The post explicitly mentions past self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago""). Under the ""Behavior"" definition, self-harming behavior qualifies as ""Behavior"" when combined with explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" explicitly expresses a desire to escape life through death, fulfilling the suicidal-thought requirement. While the self-harm is past behavior, the definition of ""Behavior"" includes current expressions of suicidal thoughts alongside any mention of self-harm or planning.)*",behavior,True

I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much. At the same time, this is so much to carry alone, it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone. It's too much.

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""the more suicidal I get,"" ""I think about suicide every day"") and desires to not be alive, fitting the **ideation** definition.  
- While the user references ""detailed plans"" in a journal, these plans are not described with specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no mention of weapons, pills, or locations like bridges). Vague references to ""plans"" without actionable details remain in **ideation**.  
- The user explicitly states they would ""never do it"" due to fear of hell and hospitalization costs, confirming the absence of intent or imminent risk.  
- No past suicide attempts are described, ruling out **attempt**.  
- Expressions of distress alone (e.g., loneliness, sadness) without explicit suicidal intent would be **indicator**, but the explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts elevate it to **ideation**.

4. **Expression of capability/desire**: ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide"" reflects a current state of suicidal thought without actionable intent.

I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth.

A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person.

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""make me want to die,"" ""I do not want to exist anymore,"" ""I want to be done"") and passive wishes for harm (""I almost hope something bad happens to me""). However, it does **not** mention a specific suicide plan, method, preparation, or past attempt.

I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people.

Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it.

- Past suicide attempts.  
- Active self-harm behaviors.

**Reasoning:**

- It includes recurring thoughts of acting on this desire (""frequently come close to doing it"").  
- However, it lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or concrete steps). The car crash metaphor is symbolic, not a literal plan.

The post expresses a passive acceptance of death as preferable in hypothetical accidents (""if somehow I got an accident""), but explicitly denies active intent (""I won't commit"").

- No explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to die is present
- Mentions death as a concept but lacks direct references to suicide/self-harm
- General dissatisfaction with life is evident, but falls under ""indicator"" when suicide isn't explicitly mentioned
- The questioning format further distances it from active ideation

- No specific plans, methods, timelines, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no references to tools, locations, or actions).  
- No description of past suicide attempts exists.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly states ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself"" and ""I'm ready to say goodbye,"" which directly expresses a desire to end one's life. However, there is **no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or self-harming behavior** (e.g., tools, locations, or concrete steps). Phrases like ""trying to kill myself"" indicate active suicidal intent but lack actionable details required for ""behavior."" Past attempts are not referenced, ruling out ""attempt."" While distress and hopelessness are present, the explicit suicidal intent moves it beyond ""indicator."" Thus, it fits the ""ideation"" category per the definition: explicit desire to die without a specific plan.",indicator,True
301,The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it. My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of. I could do it right now.

It's a neverending cycle. I'm done.,1,ideation,"ideation

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""killing myself,"" ""could do it right now"") and a desire to die.  
- It expresses internal conflict (""fear of death,"" ""scared of emptiness"") preventing action.  
- **No specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt is described** (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or prior actions).  
- Fits the **ideation** definition: explicit desire to end life without concrete plans or behaviors.",ideation,True

The only thing keeping me here is I don't know what happens after I die. I don't know if there's a heaven (I doubt) or is it just complete blackness.",1,ideation,"Based on the definitions provided:

1.  The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I want to die"", which is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire not to be alive.
2.  There is **no mention** of a specific plan, method (like pills, weapons, location), or preparation to act on these thoughts.
3.  There is **no mention** of past suicide attempts.
4.  The content focuses on the current desire to die, hopelessness, and fear of death/the unknown, but lacks the concrete planning elements required for 'behavior' or the description of past actions required for 'attempt'.

Therefore, the post belongs to the **ideation** category.

Explanation:
The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I'm better off dead"") and hopelessness (""Can't stand this anymore""), which fits the **ideation** definition:
- Direct expression of not wanting to be alive (""better off dead"")
- No mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts
- General distress and self-loathing are present but secondary to the explicit suicidal desire

1. Writing a suicide note with instructions for belongings distribution  
2. Considering administrative tasks (cancellations) as part of suicide planning  
3. Stating they ""get ready to die""

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses extreme distress, hopelessness, and feelings of oppression (e.g., ""slaves to a fascist regime,"" ""no freedom""). However, there is **no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts**. The language focuses on societal critique and metaphorical comparisons (e.g., ""Australia = Auschwitz""), not personal intent to self-harm or die by suicide.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I just want to die and go to Heaven"") as an escape from emotional pain, indicating suicidal thoughts.

They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

- Mentions of the friend's suicide attempts (*""multiple suicide attempts per month""*) do not apply, as the risk classification **only pertains to the person writing the post**.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision.

The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""end my own life,"" ""killing myself"") and frames suicide as a logical solution.

**Explanation:** The post explicitly expresses a desire to end life (""end it all if we don't want to be here"") and references a method (gun) as a hypothetical solution (""which would solve everything""). However, it does not describe a concrete, actionable plan (e.g., acquiring specific means, setting a time/location) or current preparations.

I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it.

**Explanation:** The post explicitly states ""thinking about wanting to kill myself,"" which directly expresses suicidal thoughts (a desire to end one's life).

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support.

The post describes self-harm (cutting) and emotional distress due to others dismissing their pain and accusations of attention-seeking. While it mentions self-harm and feeling ""numb and empty,"" there is **no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans for suicide, or past suicide attempts**.

I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse.

I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry. I'm so sorry. There is no putting me back together. Im broken. I'm damaged. I'm all fucked up. I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work.

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""planning on killing myself"") and a desire to die (""this life for me isn't it"").  
- It mentions a general timeframe (age 25/30) but **lacks any specific method, location, tools, or concrete preparations** required for the ""behavior"" category.  
- The phrasing (""depends lol,"" ""still have time to rethink,"" ""if I still feel the same"") frames it as conditional future contemplation rather than an active/imminent plan.  
- No past suicide attempts are described, ruling out ""attempt.""  
- Explicit suicidal intent moves it beyond ""indicator.""  

Thus, it meets the ""ideation"" definition: explicit desire to end one's life without a specific, actionable plan.",indicator,True

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses distress about societal perceptions and references suicide statistics, but there is **no explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts**. Phrases like ""teetering on the edge"" imply emotional struggle but fall under general distress without mentioning a desire to die, self-harm, or suicide methods. The discussion of suicide rates is observational, not personal. This aligns with the **Indicator** category definition.",indicator,True
330,My mom told me suicide is a coward way to go out. Thanks mom. Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours. Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :(.,2,behavior,"Based on the definitions:

1. **Explicit suicidal thought is present**: ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" explicitly implies a desire to end life soon.  
2. **No specific plan described**: No mention of method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparations. The 24-hour timeframe indicates urgency but not a concrete plan.  
3. **Not a past attempt**: Focus is on imminent future action, not a historical event.  

This meets the **Ideation** definition: explicit desire to die without a specific plan.

331,"Abused as a child. I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I don't have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"indicator  

The post expresses intense distress, self-hatred, and feelings of being trapped (""it's killing me""), but there is **no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts**. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is metaphorical, reflecting emotional anguish rather than literal intent to die. The content focuses on the abuse, helplessness, and desire for legal protection, falling under general distress without suicidal ideation or behavior.  

**Key reasons**:  
- No desire to die or end life expressed.  
- No references to suicide methods, plans, or preparations.  
- No description of past suicide attempts.  
- Emotional suffering (""killing me"") remains figurative and non-specific to suicide.",indicator,True

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""someone blow my head off,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" ""please kill me"") but does **not** include a specific plan, method, preparation, or description of self-harming behavior. The mention of ""blow my head off"" references a method, but it is framed as a plea for someone else to act, not as the user's own actionable plan. Phrases like ""im fucking done"" and ""deserve death"" reinforce suicidal thoughts without detailing concrete steps. Thus, it meets the **ideation** definition: explicit expressions of suicidal desire without a specific plan.",ideation,True

**Reasoning:**
1. **Explicit desire to end life:** The user explicitly states ""if I ended my life right now this wouldn't be a problem,"" expressing a clear desire to die.
2. **No specific plan or method:** While the user mentions ending their life as a solution, there is no reference to a method (e.g., cutting, pills, weapons), location, preparations, or timeline. The phrase ""cut my life short"" is metaphorical, not a literal description of a plan.
3. **No past attempt described:** The post discusses hypothetical future actions (""if I ended my life""), not past suicide attempts.
4. **Distress without suicide mention isn't enough:** While the post details significant distress and hopelessness, the explicit wish to die moves it beyond ""indicator.""

I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,attempt,attempt,True

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly states ""I'm feeling suicidal"" and ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more,"" indicating a **current desire to die**. However, it does **not** mention any specific suicide method, plan, preparation, or past attempt. Phrases like ""the only escape is suicide"" reflect ideation (desire to end life) without actionable details. Distress about consequences (parental reaction, suspension) and self-perception as a ""burden"" further support suicidal ideation but do not escalate to ""behavior"" (no plan) or ""attempt"" (no past action).  

Per the definitions:  
- **Ideation** explicitly covers ""desire to not be alive"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" without plans.  
- **Behavior** would require mentions of methods/tools (e.g., ""I have pills/rope"" or ""I’ll jump from X"").  
- **Attempt** would require past actions (e.g., ""I tried to overdose yesterday"").  
- **Indicator** is ruled out due to explicit suicidal language.",indicator,True

The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden, but it **lacks any explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts**. While the content indicates significant mental health struggles (e.g., isolation, unemployment, extreme inactivity), it does not reference a desire to die, suicide, self-harm, or concrete actions related to ending one’s life. Per the definitions:

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad.

The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""end it all,"" ""commit lifen't,"" ""free to kill myself"") and references active consideration of suicide (""looking into my options to end it all""). However, it does **not** specify any concrete plan, method, location, tool, or preparation (e.g., weapons, pills, notes, or research on methods/locations).

But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain . I'm so scared I've never done anything like this before and I'm so scared of the pain I will cause to my parents and family .

I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly states ""I jsut want to die,"" expressing a direct desire to end life without mentioning a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., means, location, timeline). It describes intense distress and hopelessness but lacks references to actionable suicide plans or past attempts. This aligns with the **Ideation** category definition: explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.",ideation,True

I put a stop to it again and again but everytime something got hard with my family I kept running to the other woman for support. I knew it was wrong and I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much. We were together for two years. But she found out about the previous incident and left. I am fully responsible for everything that happened. Im so regretful and sorry for hurting her. My mum is in her final couple of weeks, im her primary carer and I dont know how to process any of it. She will be leaving my little brother who is autistic in my care. I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously. I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing",1,ideation,"attempt

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly references past suicide attempts (""I was hospitalised for it previously""), which directly fits the 'attempt' category definition (historic actions).  
- While there is current suicidal ideation (""I will be joining her""), the note specifies: ""**when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'**"".  
- No specific plan/method/preparation (behavior) is described for the current thoughts, but the presence of a past attempt overrides concurrent ideation per the guidelines.",ideation,True
356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"indicator

**Reasoning:**  
- The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and exhaustion (e.g., ""tired of living,"" ""nothing changes,"" ""tear me down every night"").  
- Phrases like ""I don’t have much time left before I have to stop it"" imply urgency but **lack explicit mention of suicide, death, or self-harm**.  
- No references to suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts exist.  
- Falls under *Indicator* per the definition: ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" without explicit suicidal intent. Vague urgency (""stop it"") is insufficient for *Ideation* or *Behavior*.",indicator,True

I used to love making shit. I used to love trying and experimenting and wasting time because it wasn't a waste to me. But capitalism and instant gratification has irreparably fucked up my brain. I don't want to anymore. It wasn't supposed to happen to me but it did. I don't know where I want to go and what future I may or may not have. I don't know anything anymore.

All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide and be depressed. Would've been better for me to not be here at all.",1,ideation,"ideation

The post explicitly states ""constantly contemplate suicide,"" which directly expresses suicidal thoughts without mentioning any specific plan, method, or past attempt. This aligns with the **Ideation** category definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" Phrases like ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" reinforce the desire to not be alive but lack actionable plans or references to past attempts. General dissatisfaction (""mediocre existence,"" depression) and hopelessness support the context but do not override the explicit suicidal ideation.",ideation,True

I'm not looking for sympathy or compassion really I'm just looking to know if anyone else feels like the release is better as their life is a bust. To say hey jesus or whatever I had an impossible situation can I go back?",1,ideation,"indicator

The post expresses severe distress and mentions considering suicide as a ""release,"" but does not explicitly state a current desire to die or end one's own life. Key reasons:
- Uses questioning/philosophical language (""When to know if suicide is better,"" ""if anyone else feels like the release is better"") rather than personal declarations of intent
- Describes life circumstances (trauma, anhedonia, abuse) and hopelessness
- Mentions ""suicide"" in a hypothetical context, not as a current personal plan or active thought
- No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts described

This aligns with the **indicator** category, which includes expressions of distress and vague references to death/suicide without explicit current suicidal desire or intent.",indicator,True

The post explicitly expresses ongoing suicidal thoughts (""fighting down suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death"") and consideration of suicide (""some days I consider it""). However, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt.

Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone.

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses extreme hopelessness, dissatisfaction with life, and mentions feeling ""trapped"" and needing ""something to push me over the edge,"" but it **lacks explicit expressions of suicidal intent** (e.g., ""I want to die/kill myself""). Phrases like ""free from it all"" and ""eternal void"" are metaphorical and vague about death/suicide. There is **no mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts**.

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"indicator

Explanation: The post discusses suicide in a general, third-person context about why people reach that point (""bottled everything up,"" ""snap and break down""). There is **no explicit expression** of the author's own suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts. It reflects on emotional distress broadly but lacks personal desire, method, plan, or action related to suicide.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""If I kill myself,"" ""leave this world forever"") and references motivations for suicide (anger, defiance). However, it **does not include** any specific method, plan (e.g., tools, location, timing), or preparatory actions. It also **does not describe** a past suicide attempt.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own.

He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside.

I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"") and an inability to function in the world, indicating a wish to not be alive. However, it **does not** mention a specific suicide plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. The phrase ""Dead"" qualifies as an explicit expression of suicidal ideation under the definition (desire to end life without a plan). General hopelessness and distress align with ideation when paired with this explicit statement. No elements of ""behavior"" (plan/method) or ""attempt"" (past action) are present.",ideation,True

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly mentions ""kill their self,"" indicating a direct expression of suicidal thoughts. However, it poses a general question about others' motivations for intervention rather than describing a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. This aligns with the **Ideation** category: explicit suicidal desire without details of planning or action.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly states ""i want to take myself out"" (a direct expression of suicidal desire). However, it does **not** describe a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. The fear of pain (""i'm scared it'll be painful"") reinforces the absence of actionable planning.

This aligns with the **Ideation** category definition: explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""desire to not be alive"") without indicating a plan or behavior.

That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way. It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone, they'll just have less children to feed, and less bills to pay. I want to die but I'm scared of the consequences of failure.",1,ideation,"Based on the explicit expressions in the post:

- The author states they are ""**contemplating**"" (which, in context with the rest of the sentence, refers to suicidal thoughts).
- They explicitly say, ""**I want to die**"".
- They describe ""**thinking on how to die painlessly**"" for 6+ months, indicating a persistent desire to end their life.
- They explicitly express a **desire not to be alive** (""It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone"").

However:
- They state they have ""**yet to find a way**"", indicating no specific method or plan has been determined.
- There is no mention of preparing means (pills, weapons), locations, or a concrete plan.
- They express fear of ""**consequences of failure**"", reinforcing the absence of a current actionable plan.

The post expresses deep dissatisfaction with life and questions the purpose/desire to live for a long duration, but contains **no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts**. The frustration focuses on the perceived burden of living many more years rather than a stated desire to end one's life.

The post discusses ""suicide by cop"" as a hypothetical scenario for others described as ""passive suicidal,"" but the author does not express any personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts.

The post explicitly mentions a plan to commit suicide using a specific method (insulin pump overdose: ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button""), describes it as ""the way I choose to go,"" and references preparations/accessibility (""easiest and most accessible"").

Worst birthday ever !,1,ideation,"Based on the definitions and the post content:

- The post explicitly expresses a current desire to die (""ever wanted to kill yourself...? well I do"").
- It references an immediate opportunity (""I have a chance right now"") but **lacks any specific method, location, tool, or preparatory action** required for the ""behavior"" category.
- There is no description of a past suicide attempt.

This falls under **ideation** because it expresses explicit suicidal desire without detailing a concrete plan or method. The phrase ""have a chance"" implies opportunity but does not constitute an explicit plan as defined.

Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever.

- Preparations (e.g., acquiring tools)

I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving.

I know I'm an asshole for it but I'm tired of well-intentioned strangers trying to help me get better, *there is no better, this is it*, I'm just a fucking monster and I'm depressed for a reason, I deserve it. I know I suck, everyone who cares to see it knows that I suck, I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot.",1,ideation,"ideation

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I wish someone would... slit my fucking throat""). However, the user explicitly states **""I have no plans""** and frames violent outcomes as passive wishes rather than actionable intent. No specific method, preparation, or imminent self-harm behavior is described. Past attempts are not mentioned. This fits the **ideation** category: explicit desire to die without a concrete plan.",ideation,True

But that shit's gone, long gone, and it isn't coming back. But it's all I want. I'm defined by that longing and I have been for years. I don't show it, I'm not thirsty, I don't act like an entitled incel. I just keep to myself. I don't even try anymore, what's the fucking point? I'm just a fucking sad man. And who wants to be with a sad man? Noone. So that's my company, forever. Noone. I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness.",0,indicator,"ideation

The post expresses a strong desire to end life (""so am I"" after parents pass) without specifying any method, plan, or preparation. While conditional (""the second they're gone""), this constitutes explicit suicidal ideation per the definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan."" No tools, locations, or preparatory actions are mentioned, ruling out 'behavior'. Past attempts are absent, ruling out 'attempt'. The suicidal intent is explicit, moving it beyond 'indicator'.",indicator,True

**Explanation:**  
The post discusses avoiding disclosure of suicidal thoughts due to fear of consequences and therapy difficulties. While it references suicidal thoughts indirectly (""lying about the suicidal thoughts""), it does **not** contain:  
- Explicit expressions of a *current* desire to die (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"").  
- Any mention of a plan, method, or preparation for suicide.  
- References to past suicide attempts.  

The phrase ""grave I dug myself"" is metaphorical, conveying hopelessness and distress but not an explicit suicidal intent. The core focus is on concealment of past thoughts and general emotional struggle, aligning with the ""indicator"" category’s definition of distress without explicit suicidal expression.",indicator,True

The post explicitly states ""I fucking hate living,"" which directly expresses a current desire to not be alive, aligning with the **ideation** definition. While it references past events (""nearly killing myself""), this describes a historical consideration rather than a concrete past attempt or current plan. No specific suicide method, preparation, or active self-harm behavior is mentioned, ruling out ""behavior"" or ""attempt."" The expression of hopelessness and distress alone would be ""indicator,"" but the explicit wish to not live elevates it to ideation.",indicator,True

The post explicitly states ""Suicide has become my quick solution,"" expressing a current desire to end life as an escape mechanism. This meets the **Ideation** definition: explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""desire to not be alive"") without mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. While the post describes intense distress and hopelessness, it lacks concrete details about means, locations, or actions taken toward suicide, ruling out ""behavior"" or ""attempt.""

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly states ""I get suicidal thoughts,"" which directly expresses a desire to die without mentioning a specific plan, method, or preparation. The qualifier ""I'm probably too much of a pussy to ever do it"" reinforces the absence of intent or actionable behavior. References to past family suicide and general distress (""feeling like shit"") are contextual but do not alter the core classification of current suicidal ideation without a plan.

**Explanation:**  
- The post explicitly states ""i wanna off myself"" and ""if i killed myself,"" which directly expresses a desire to die by suicide.  
- There is **no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past suicide attempt**. The author discusses fears, hopelessness, and therapy struggles but does not reference actionable steps (e.g., acquiring means, setting a time/place) or prior attempts.  
- This aligns with the **Ideation** definition: explicit suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan. Mentions of depression, therapy discontinuation, and hopelessness reinforce distress but do not shift the category.",ideation,True

I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"Based on the definitions and the content of the post:

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly states ""I've been contemplating suicide"" and ""I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it,"" expressing a current desire to die.  
- While the post mentions self-harm (""cutting myself""), an agreement to commit suicide with another person (""we agreed if she should want to kill herself then we will do it together""), and a declaration of intent (""I'm ending it""), **no specific method, plan, preparation, location, or means for suicide is described**.  
- The reference to the other person's ""failed attempt"" is not the user's own past action, so ""attempt"" does not apply.

**Explanation:**  
The post contains distressing content involving abusive parental quotes referencing suicide methods (e.g., ""shoot yourself,"" ""cut your wrists"") and past self-harm (""did you try to kill yourself again?""). However, the **author of the post** does not:  
- Express their *own* current suicidal thoughts (ideation),  
- Describe *their own* plans or preparations for suicide (behavior),  
- Disclose *their own* past suicide attempts (attempt).  

The quotes describe harmful statements *directed at* the author by parents, but the author themself only reports these interactions without expressing personal suicidal intent, plans, or actions. Per the guidelines, risk assessment applies **only to the person writing the post**, and the author’s narrative lacks explicit suicidal expression from themselves. Mentions of suicide are attributed to others, fitting the **indicator** category (expressions of distress without explicit suicidal disclosure by the author).",indicator,True

However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, location, or preparation for suicide (e.g., ""with a knife,"" ""on a bridge,"" ""I have pills""), nor does it reference past actions. The first part (""committing a massacre"") implies harm to others but does not alter the classification of the user's expressed self-directed intent.

For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind.

Either kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out, shoot myself with a gun, or start cutting myself to try and ease my pain. My existence has been nothing but depression, fear, regret and worthlessness. Its a net gain for the world if i die. I'm such a fucking dumbass and a lazy asshole. How stupid am I to fail senior year. How stupid am I to still want the love and affection from a family that is toxic, gaslighting, mean and fake. Why couldn't I have been aborted. I'm just waiting for the end. I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold. My body probably wouldn't be found for months until my bills start rising.

**Explanation:** The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being overwhelmed (""This world is shit,"" ""I just want someone to goddamn love me,"" ""I want to cry my damn eyes out,"" ""I seriously don't know what's real""). However, there is **no explicit mention** of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, a plan to harm oneself, or past attempts. The distress focuses on emotional pain, confusion, and relationship struggles, but it does not cross into expressing suicidal ideation or behavior based on the provided definitions. Therefore, it falls under the ""indicator"" category.",indicator,True
431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice.

The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""i shouldn't kill myself,"" ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"") and includes planning elements by specifying a timeframe (""the day i chose is very soon""). This constitutes preparatory intent, aligning with the **Behavior** category definition where explicit planning (including chosen timing) elevates it beyond ideation. No past attempts are described, and the suicidal intent is current and planned.",ideation,True

**Explanation:** The post explicitly states ""This the most suicidal I've been in a couple months"" and ""I Just want to be out of my misery,"" clearly expressing a desire to die or end suffering (suicidal ideation). There is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past suicide attempt. Therefore, it meets the definition of **Ideation**.",ideation,True
434,I just want to die. Why is it so hard to die. I just want to kill myself but I can't find a suitable way to go,1,ideation,"Based on the definitions provided:

The post states:
- ""I just want to die""
- ""I just want to kill myself""

This constitutes **explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts** (desire to end one's life), satisfying the core requirement for 'ideation'.

It adds:
- ""but I can't find a suitable way to go""

This explicitly states the *absence* of a specific plan or method. The user is expressing frustration about *not* having identified a means/method, which directly indicates no concrete plan exists.

Therefore, the post belongs to:
**ideation**

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses distress (low point, loneliness, low self-esteem) and hopelessness about life circumstances, but there is **no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, self-harm, plans, methods, or past attempts**. The user seeks advice about improving their situation (moving countries), which aligns with the ""indicator"" category's definition of general dissatisfaction without references to suicide.",indicator,True

The post expresses intense anger and a wish for harm to another person (""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP""), but contains **no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, plans, behavior, or past attempts by the author**. The hostility is directed outward, not inward.

**Reasoning**:  
- The post focuses on **homicidal intent** (""I will kill her,"" ""how to murder her"") rather than suicidal intent.  
- While the word ""suicide"" is mentioned, it describes a hypothetical scenario involving killing others (""not kill only yourself""), not the author's personal desire to die.  
- There is **no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts** by the author. The distress described relates to bullying, not a desire to end the author’s own life.  
- Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned as a personal action or desire, it remains in the ""indicator"" category per the guidelines.

The post expresses intense distress, depression, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life due to gender dysphoria, trauma, and isolation. Phrases like ""am tired of being unhappy,"" ""tired of being depressed,"" and pleas for God to remove negative thoughts indicate severe emotional suffering. However, there is **no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, or past attempts**. The focus is on wishing to be ""normal"" and free from suffering, but it lacks direct references to suicide or self-harm as defined in the categories.

The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and chronic pain (""It's been 8 months, with no change in sight""), but there is **no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts** by the author.

The only person who truly understands the pain I'm feeling",1,ideation,"Based on the definitions provided, the post belongs to the category: **ideation**.

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Explicit Desire for Death:** The author explicitly expresses a desire to cease living: ""I'm over life,"" ""looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death,"" and finds comfort in the idea of death reuniting them with a lost loved one.
2.  **No Specific Plan:** While the phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" implies an endpoint, it does not describe a specific method (e.g., pills, hanging, jumping), location, time, or preparation (e.g., acquiring means) for suicide. It remains a statement about finality and desire, not actionable steps.
3.  **Not Past Attempt:** The post references someone else's past suicide (""took their own life""), but does not describe any past suicide attempt *by the author*.
4.  **Beyond Indicator:** The expressions of hopelessness (""road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose"") and the explicit desire to die move this beyond general distress or dissatisfaction (Indicator) into explicit suicidal thoughts (Ideation).

2. A specific suicide method, plan, or preparation (required for behavior)

**Reasoning:**
1. **Explicit expression of suicidal thoughts:** The post contains direct statements like ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"", ""Death seems a better option"", ""I want out"", and ""call it quits now"". These explicitly express a desire to end one's life.
2. **Absence of a specific plan or method:** While the author expresses a strong wish to die, they mention no specific suicide method (e.g., pills, weapons, locations), preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or timeline. The focus is on the *desire* to escape life, not a *plan* to act.

I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"Based on the definitions and the post content:

1. **Explicit mention of suicide**: The phrase ""not to kill myself"" is an explicit reference to suicide.
2. **No specific plan/method**: While ""suicide attempts"" is mentioned, it's framed as a future possibility to be ""postponed,"" with no details about methods, tools, locations, or preparations.
3. **No past attempt described**: References to suicide are future-oriented (""postpone,"" ""next decade"").
4. **Focus on ideation**: The core message is that Star Wars content provides a reason to avoid acting on existing suicidal thoughts (""a reason not to kill myself""), fitting the **Ideation** definition (explicit desire to end life without a plan).

The post explicitly states ""I have absolutely no will to live anymore"" and ""I just want to end it all"". This expresses a clear desire to die or end one's life. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or timeline for suicide. The language focuses on hopelessness and the wish to die, but lacks any concrete suicidal planning or behavior.

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""Feel like dying again,"" ""Just kill me"") and hopelessness (""There's no end to anything"").

The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and paranoia (""I'm really starting to think this is hell""), but lacks any explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts. Key observations:
- No desire to die or end life is stated (required for 'ideation').
- No references to suicide methods, plans, or preparations (required for 'behavior').
- No description of past suicide attempts (required for 'attempt').
- Distress is focused on external circumstances (landlord, neighbors, illness, financial strain) without expressing suicidal intent.  
- Phrases like ""I just wanna leave this place"" and ""I want to leave"" imply a desire to escape the situation, not end life.

**Explanation**: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and a desire not to be alive (""I know I will always be a loser""), which fits the *Ideation* definition (expressing suicidal thoughts without specific plans). It rules out *Behavior* because no methods, locations, or preparations are mentioned. It rules out *Attempt* because no past actions are described. The statement ""I will probably never kill myself"" reinforces the absence of intent/plan, keeping it in *Ideation*. *Indicator* is ruled out due to explicit suicidal language.",indicator,True

The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"") and describes preparatory behaviors that qualify as explicit planning under the ""Behavior"" definition:  
1. **Specific timing** (""on new year's eve"")  
2. **Preparation of suicide notes** (""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"")

- The user explicitly describes **past self-harm** (""I tried to cut myself last night"") during a breakdown.
- The context clarifies this was an isolated incident driven by a desire ""to feel something real"" while intoxicated, with no stated suicidal intent or desire to die.
- There is **no mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or intent** (current or past). Self-harm alone does not automatically imply suicidal intent per the definitions.

2. It questions societal views on suicide (""Is suicide really as bad...""), indicating active contemplation of ending one's life.  
3. There is **no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt**. The phrase ""so I don't kill myself"" implies a current struggle with suicidal thoughts but no actionable steps.  
4. This fits the **ideation** definition: explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan.

- The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness (""no reason to live""), and acceptance of death due to illness (""will eventually die""). 
- There are **no explicit statements** about suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to kill myself""), methods, plans, or past attempts.

The post explicitly states ""I'll still be suicidal lol,"" directly expressing a current desire to die. It discusses envy of others' successful suicides and rhetorical questions like ""Why can't that be me?"" which reveal persistent suicidal thoughts.

The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""wants to die,"" ""probably [going to hell] anyway,"" ""one of the only things keeping me alive"").

The post explicitly states ""I thought of killing myself multiple times,"" which directly expresses suicidal thoughts (a desire to end one's life). However, there is **no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt**. The absence of these elements rules out ""behavior"" (requires a plan) and ""attempt"" (requires past action).

At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life.

I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd.

**Category: Ideation**  

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""face death,"" ""gonna start working out until i die"").

- The phrase ""if not, well, you know what happened"" implies an expectation/acceptance of death, aligning with suicidal intent without a concrete plan.  
- This fits the **ideation** definition: explicit desire to end life without a detailed plan.

The retirement dilemma contextualizes hopelessness but doesn’t introduce behavioral elements.",ideation,True

488,I really need to stop feeling this way. No really. I've been lying when I say it's not that bad. Today's a great day. It's hell. If anyone or anything truely cared about my life I know it isn't me. Not anymore. I feel so empire. So out of place with everyone I'm around. I just want to end but haven't yet.,1,ideation,"ideation

**Explanation:**  
The phrase ""I just want to end but haven't yet"" explicitly expresses a desire to end life (suicidal ideation) but lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The post focuses on hopelessness and a wish to die without actionable steps or references to past attempts, fitting the **ideation** definition.",ideation,True
489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,behavior,behavior,True

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,behavior,behavior,True
492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"indicator

**Explanation:**  
The post expresses existential despair, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""What's the point of living,"" ""dumbest shit ever,"" ""wish I was never born""). However, it explicitly states ""don’t really want to die"" and contains **no direct mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts**. General expressions questioning life's purpose without explicit suicidal intent align with the ""indicator"" category definition.",indicator,True
493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"indicator

The post expresses significant distress, shame, and social anxiety related to a personal incident and fear of judgment at a new school. However, it contains **no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, desires, death, self-harm, plans, methods, or past attempts**. The content focuses on emotional pain and seeking advice on handling social stigma, which aligns with the ""Indicator"" category (general distress without explicit suicidal expression).",indicator,True
494,families are really selfish. they bought u into this world and then you suddenly get sick of it. and they dont let you kill yourself. what kind of an asshole move is that?why do you want me to suffer just for your well being and your pleasure? what the fuck is wrong with you?,1,ideation,"ideation

**Reasoning:**  
- The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself,"" indicating a direct desire to end one's life.  
- There is **no description of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt**.  
- The focus is on frustration about being prevented from acting on suicidal thoughts, not on actionable steps or historical actions.  
- Fits the **Ideation** definition: explicit expression of suicidal desire without a plan or behavioral elements.",ideation,True
495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"ideation

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""pls fucking end me"") and hopelessness, which fits the **Ideation** category. It lacks any mention of a specific suicide plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. The phrase ""say im going to do it"" implies a threat but does not detail a concrete plan, keeping it in the *Ideation* scope per the definitions.",ideation,True
496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"Based on the definitions and the post content:

- The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I hope it'll be me next"" regarding stabbings) and directly mentions suicide as an alternative (""Wouldn't have to bring shame... with a suicide"").
- While stabbing is mentioned as a method, it is framed as a **hoped-for external event** (""another stabbing"") rather than the user describing their **own plan or preparations** to stab themselves. There is no indication of specific actionable steps (e.g., acquiring a weapon, choosing a location/time, or rehearsing the act).
- The context is a **current wish to die**, not a description of a past attempt.

This meets the criteria for **ideation** (explicit suicidal desire without a specific plan).

497,"how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?. okay so i will go straight to the point and i dont want any affection or ""oh dont do that your life is more worth than that and blablabla"" im 19 i have 0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money, i want to put an end to it all but there is something blocking me to do that and ots my family, how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it? maybe was just an accident idk, thanks and sorry for the bad english",1,ideation,"Based on the definitions:

1.  **Explicit suicidal thoughts are present:** ""killmyself"", ""put an end to it all"", ""disappear"", ""kill myself"".
2.  **A specific plan is mentioned:** The user describes a plan to ""go to another country [and] have another identity"" specifically to enable killing themselves ""with peace and with no one knowing"", possibly making it look like an accident. This constitutes planning regarding location (another country), method (implied to be hidden/anonymous), and preparatory steps (changing identity).

The post describes **current** thoughts combined with a **plan** (relocating and changing identity to facilitate suicide). There is no mention of a **past action** (Attempt). The specific plan elements move it beyond Ideation.

498,"I'm still here, but I had enough of this. Hey there. Unfortunately, I'm still alive. I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets, but EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF, I FUCKING BREATHE. WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY!. I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!. THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!. I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful. This is the least pain-proof way I could die. Oh, and one more thing. If God doesn't take me to Heaven, then he's a dumb, selfless bitch. People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"attempt

**Explanation:**  
The post explicitly describes a **past suicide attempt** (""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation...""), which fits the 'attempt' category definition: ""content describes past attempts at suicide."" Although the user mentions future plans (""I'm gonna try again tonight""), the note clarifies: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The description of a concrete past action (attempted suffocation) is the defining factor.",attempt,True

This aligns with the **Indicator** category, defined as lacking explicit suicide references while showing distress.
