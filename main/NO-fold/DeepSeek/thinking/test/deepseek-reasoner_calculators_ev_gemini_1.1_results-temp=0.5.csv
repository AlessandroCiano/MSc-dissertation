0,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.'Tired.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""so hopeless against my head""), despair (""Nothing changes""), exhaustion (""wake up even more tired of living""), and self-blame (""I feel so stupid... so weak"").  
   - Mentions of intrusive thoughts/dreams causing distress but no explicit references to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - Key phrase: ""I don’t have much time left before I have to stop it"" – ambiguous but contextually refers to ending mental suffering, not suicide.  
   - No past actions, plans, methods, or temporal urgency tied to self-harm.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **No** explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent terms.  
   - **No** clear desire to die expressed (e.g., ""stop it"" likely refers to ending emotional pain, not life).  
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned; distress focuses on heartbreak and mental exhaustion.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **None** identified. No tools, locations, substances, or preparations referenced.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Describes ongoing emotional struggle but **no** past/current suicidal actions (e.g., no attempts, aborted actions, or preparations).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Primary themes are emotional distress, hopelessness, and fatigue from intrusive thoughts – **no** suicidal desire, plan, or behavior.  
   - Ambiguous phrasing (""stop it"") lacks suicidal specificity; context supports ending mental anguish, not life.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses severe distress without personal suicidal intent, plan, or action.

1,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The author expresses deep grief over their sister's suicide 548 days prior and references her past attempts.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""what's the point?""), pain, and feeling that suicide seems like a ""welcome end"" on some days.  
   - Explicitly mentions their own past ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" but clarifies it failed.  
   - Currently, they describe passive suicidal ideation (e.g., ""welcome end,"" questioning why they should ""bother going through all of it""), but state they won’t act due to concern for their parents.  
   - No current plan, method, preparation, or imminent timeline is mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""it would be a welcome end""). However, they counter this by affirming they won’t act to avoid hurting their parents.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While a past attempt is referenced, there is no mention of a current plan, method, tools, location, or preparation. Current ideation lacks actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past action** (""aborted attempt"" 6 years ago), which was interrupted/failed.  
   - **No current/future action**: Expresses thoughts but no indication of initiating or preparing for a new attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicitly stated (supports 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'), but no plan/method/preparation exists for current thoughts (rules out 'Behavior').  
   - Past attempt alone doesn’t dictate the category; current risk is prioritized. The absence of imminent plans/preparations aligns with 'Ideation'.  
   - Protective factors (parents) reinforce lack of intent to act, but the explicit desire to die keeps it in 'Ideation' (not 'Indicator').

2,"I'm scared therapy wont work. My parents realized 'omg hey our kid isn't really doing all that well' and now I'm going to therapy. Which is good. But I worry therapy won't work. Even on days where I'm actually happy I still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts. And it's tempting a lot of the time. I'm tired of always being afraid and upset over little things, I'm tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation. I wish I could be so much better than I am so I didn't live every moment in shame. Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses fear that therapy won't work, describes intrusive suicidal thoughts (""lol kermit sewer slide"" = slang for ""commit suicide""), and mentions these thoughts are tempting. It highlights feelings of exhaustion, shame, and hopelessness about self-improvement. No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The phrase ""kermit sewer slide"" explicitly references suicide (via slang).  
   - However, the framing (""I still get the... thoughts"") presents these as *unwanted intrusive thoughts* rather than a stated personal desire to die. The author expresses temptation but does not assert ""I want to die"" or equivalent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - The post describes ongoing intrusive thoughts and emotional distress but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no mention of initiating an attempt).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is distress about persistent suicidal thoughts explicitly framed as intrusive/unwanted (""I still get the... thoughts""), alongside hopelessness about improvement.  
   - While suicidal ideation is referenced via slang, the lack of a *personal desire to die* (emphasizing the thoughts as intrusive) and absence of plan/method/preparation align with **'Indicator'**.  
   - The ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (temptation vs. explicit intent) defaults to 'Indicator' per guidelines.

If it doesnt work out. my suicidal ass and a lot of alkohol alone at home. you see where this is going. Imma probably relapse this night. Maybe imma forget the urge from alcohol and nicotine but probably not',2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal ass,"" indicating personal suicidal thoughts. It references death/dying with phrases like ""only a few hours left,"" ""my last day on this shitty world,"" and ""Time to restart,"" implying a desire to end life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""shitty world"") and burden. Specific preparations are mentioned: ""start writing the letters"" (suicide notes). Imminence is clear with ""Sunday"" as the stated last day and ""only a few hours left."" The method is implied but not explicit: ""a lot of alkohol alone at home"" suggests potential alcohol-related harm, but no specific lethal means (e.g., pills, hanging) is detailed. The desire to die appears genuine, with no indication these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""suicidal"" and phrases like ""my last day"" express a clear personal desire to die. There is no statement negating or rejecting these thoughts (e.g., no ""I don't want to act on this"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Preparations are explicitly mentioned: ""start writing the letters"" indicates suicide note preparation. A method is implied (""alkohol alone at home"") but not specific (e.g., not detailing overdose or asphyxiation). The temporal plan (""Sunday"") and conditional scenario (""If it doesn't work out"") suggest intent, but the lack of a concrete method leans toward preparation-based classification. Since preparations are present, this points to 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""Sunday,"" ""this night"") and preparations, but no past or recent initiated lethal actions. ""Relapse"" may imply a history, but it is not described as a concrete past action here; instead, it's a future possibility (""Imma probably relapse""). No initiated suicidal act (e.g., ""I tried"") is mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""suicidal ass,"" ""last day"") rules out 'Indicator'. The presence of preparations (writing letters) and a temporal plan (Sunday) moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/prep). The implied method (alcohol) is not specific enough to strongly confirm, but the explicit preparation supports 'Behavior'. No initiated lethal action occurred, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. The rules state: if plan/prep is present, choose 'Behavior'; if unsure about method, but prep is explicit, 'Behavior' fits.

Conclusion: The post shows suicidal desire with preparation (writing letters), making 'Behavior' the best fit.

4,"Relapsed after 6 months. I don't think I'll ever recover.but I'm so worried that someone will find out. My girlfriend would break down if I tried to tell her. I don't want to see her sad. should I try and hide it from her or be honest?""",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The key elements include a mention of relapse after 6 months, expressions of hopelessness (""I don't think I'll ever recover""), worry about others discovering the relapse, and concern for the girlfriend's emotional reaction. There are no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or imminence. The emotional indicators are hopelessness and burden-related feelings (e.g., not wanting to make the girlfriend sad). The relapse is a past action, but it is not specified as suicidal or self-harming; it could relate to mental health, addiction, or other issues. The post focuses on interpersonal conflict about disclosure, with no stated desire for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No, the post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. It also does not express a clear desire to die or not be alive. The primary sentiment is distress about the relapse and its impact on relationships, not a personal wish for death. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so the ""unwanted thoughts"" aspect does not apply. This strongly leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned or implied. The relapse is vague and not tied to any suicidal plan or behavior. Without any suicidal context, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post references a past event (relapse) but does not describe it as a concrete, potentially lethal action. There is no indication that the relapse involved a suicide attempt (e.g., no description of self-initiated, life-threatening actions). Current content is about disclosure concerns, not imminent or future suicidal actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, method, or preparation. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (which requires explicit suicidal desire) or higher categories. Ambiguity about the relapse should not be overinterpreted; per the rules, when there is doubt about suicidal desire, 'Indicator' is chosen. The focus is on emotional indicators like hopelessness and burden, without suicidal intent.

Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" and feeling ""too weak and pathetic to do it.""
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""in a rut""), overwhelm, self-deprecation, and isolation (""small support system"").
   - Specific time reference: ""tomorrow while my mom is out.""  
   - No explicit method (e.g., pills, weapon) or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) described.  
   - Ambivalence: ""I know I shouldn’t"" and alternatives like contacting people or doing homework.  
   - No description of past/initiated suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I want to die tomorrow.""  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Time/opportunity (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") implies intent but **no specific method, tools, locations, or preparations** (e.g., pills, gun, note).  
   - Vague phrases like ""try and go out"" lack specificity.  
   - Leans toward *Ideation* due to absence of concrete plan elements.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **future intention** (""tomorrow"").  
   - No description of past/recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **No method/preparation** → Rules out *Behavior* (time/opportunity alone is insufficient without method).  
   - **No past/initiated action** → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits *Ideation*: Explicit desire (""I want to kill myself"") with no actionable plan or method.  
   - Ambivalence (""I know I shouldn’t"") and alternatives do not override explicit suicidal desire.

6,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions explicit suicidal intent with phrases like ""I planned to kill myself"" and ""I plan to hang myself."" It includes a specific method (hanging with a rope, cutting off a finger with an axe) and preparations (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""). Emotional indicators include distress from academic overload, self-harm (""cut my rights leg""), nervous tics, and feelings of being ""done"" and ""unmotivated,"" but the author states they are ""not sad or depress"" and feel ""happy"" in a conflicted way. There is a past suicide plan (""planned to kill myself in the forest in January"") that was not acted upon (""But I didn't""), and a current plan with imminent intent (""now it time to stop the lie and end it""). The desire to die is clear and not negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""hang myself,"" expressing a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""end it""). There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, they are presented as active intentions.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""hang myself,"" ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"") and preparations are confirmed (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""). This indicates concrete planning and readiness.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past plan (""planned to kill myself in January"") that was not initiated (no action taken). The current plan (""I plan to hang myself..."") is future-oriented, with preparations complete but no initiation of the suicidal act described. Past self-harm is mentioned, but this is not equivalent to a suicide attempt. No potentially lethal action has been initiated or completed, so it does not qualify as an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire (ruling out 'Indicator'), a specific plan and preparations (ruling out 'Ideation'), and no initiated suicidal action (ruling out 'Attempt'). The presence of a method and ready means aligns with 'Behavior,' as the author expresses current suicidal thoughts with clear planning elements.

I think if I slowly kill myself this way it will give people plenty of time to adjust and accept the idea that I'm going to die. (Maybe cushion the pain idk. )I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions death and suicide: ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""for it to finally kill me,"" ""I'm going to die,"" and directly states ""slowly kill myself."" 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., planning for death to cushion others' pain) and a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die"").
   - A specific method is described: using anorexia to achieve a lethal weight (goal of 78 pounds or lower) as a means to die slowly. This includes preparations like setting weight goals and actively engaging in the behavior to reach them.
   - The temporal context is ongoing/future-oriented: The act is described as a slow process (""slowly kill myself this way""), not a past or immediate action. There is no mention of a past initiated suicidal act (e.g., no reference to a specific event that was interrupted or failed).
   - The writer expresses a genuine, personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""for it to finally kill me""). This is not presented as unwanted thoughts but as an active intention.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: starvation via anorexia to reach a target weight (78 pounds or lower) for the purpose of dying. Preparations are indicated by setting weight goals and the ongoing behavior (""I have anorexia,"" ""my new goal weight"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention with current preparatory behavior (e.g., pursuing weight loss to die). It does not describe a past or recent initiated, potentially lethal action (like an overdose or cutting that was stopped). The anorexia is framed as a gradual means to an end, not an acute attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to explicit suicidal desire.
   - It exceeds Ideation because a specific method (anorexia as a means to die) and preparations (setting weight goals) are present.
   - It does not meet Attempt criteria, as no past or recent initiated lethal action is described; instead, it focuses on planning and ongoing behavior.
   - Therefore, with a clear plan/method, the best fit is Behavior. (Note: The rule states that if a plan/method is present, even briefly, it leans toward Behavior, and there is no ambiguity here.)

8,"Can't do any of it!. Just don't want this anymore just wanna sleep and never ever wake up""Marvellous now the fainting episodes are back ffs.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses strong emotional distress (""Can't do any of it!"", ""don't want this anymore"") and a clear desire to escape life through the metaphor ""wanna sleep and never ever wake up.""  
   - No explicit mentions of suicide, death, self-harm, or methods (e.g., pills, weapons).  
   - No references to plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - The phrase ""never ever wake up"" implies a wish for permanent cessation of consciousness (a common euphemism for death), but lacks specificity about means or intent to act.  
   - The latter part (""fainting episodes are back"") describes a health issue unrelated to suicide risk.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - The statement ""never ever wake up"" suggests a **desire to not be alive**, framed as a passive wish (sleeping forever). The author does not negate or express distress about this thought (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die""), so it reflects genuine desire.  
   - **Leans toward 'Ideation'**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes). The wish remains abstract.  
   - **No elements of 'Behavior'**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes a current emotional state and a wish for the future (""never wake up"").  
   - No reference to past or recent actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment (""never ever wake up"") reflects an **explicit personal desire to die**, placing it beyond general distress ('Indicator').  
   - Absence of plans/methods rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No description of concrete past actions rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - **Fits 'Ideation'**: Explicit desire to die without a stated plan or preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""face death,"" ""until i die,"" and ""if not, well, you know what happened,"" indicating a direct engagement with death as an outcome.
   - Emotional indicators include ""too pissed"" (anger), ""don't even want to feel good anymore,"" and ""embrace the pain,"" showing despair and hopelessness.
   - A specific method is described: ""working out until i die or pass out,"" which implies a plan to engage in potentially lethal physical exertion.
   - Preparations or initiation are indicated with ""I'm now gonna start,"" showing immediate action.
   - The temporal context is future/imminent: ""now gonna start"" and ""i'll be back in 12 hours"" suggest the action is beginning at the time of posting, with death as a possible near-term outcome.
   - The writer expresses a desire for death (e.g., ""embrace the pain and face death,"" ""until i die""), not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""), but death is directly referenced with a personal desire (""face death,"" ""until i die"").
   - The writer shows a clear desire to die or risk death, as seen in the acceptance of death as an outcome. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""working out until i die or pass out,"" which is a potentially lethal means.
   - Preparation/initiation is explicit with ""I'm now gonna start,"" indicating the behavior is being acted upon imminently.
   - This moves beyond mere ideation to behavior due to the method and initiation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention with immediate initiation (""now gonna start""), not a past event.
   - The action (working out to the point of death or unconsciousness) is being initiated at the time of posting, but it is not described as a completed or past action (e.g., no reference to having already started or completed the act). The phrase ""if i survived"" implies the outcome is uncertain and future-oriented.
   - Since no past or completed potentially lethal action is described (e.g., ""I tried and failed""), this does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - There is a clear desire to die (ruling out 'Indicator').
   - The presence of a specific method (""working out until i die"") and immediate initiation (""now gonna start"") rules out 'Ideation' (which requires no plan/method).
   - This fits 'Behavior' because it includes suicidal desire, a specific method, and preparations being taken (initiating the action). It does not qualify as 'Attempt' because no past or completed action is described; the lethal behavior is current/future but not yet resolved.

   - The post explicitly mentions ""I just attempted to end my life,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide. Key elements include descriptions of self-harm (""my wrists and thighs are bleeding already""), the use of a specific method (""knife""), and preparations (""I was ready""). Emotional indicators like despair (""Living life as a shell is bullshit"") and a stated desire to die (""I was ready to leave everything,"" ""I almost committed"") are present. The action is recent and imminent (""just attempted,"" ""I was right there""). The writer expresses frustration at not completing the act but confirms a genuine wish to die at the time.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""end my life,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""committed"" (implying suicide). It clearly expresses a personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the writer regrets not succeeding.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (using a knife to cut wrists and thighs) is mentioned, and preparations are evident (bleeding indicates initiated action, and the writer was ""ready""). However, this step is secondary because the post describes an action that was already initiated, moving beyond planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a very recent, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: the writer attempted suicide (""I just attempted""), caused bleeding, and was ""about to do"" it before stopping themselves (""I put down my knife""). This fits the definition of an attempt, as it was a concrete, life-threatening action that was initiated but not completed due to self-interruption.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core of the post is the description of a past/recent suicide attempt (""I just attempted""), which takes precedence over any current ideation or behavior. The action was initiated and potentially lethal (as indicated by bleeding), even though it was stopped by the writer. This aligns with the 'Attempt' category, which includes interrupted or failed actions. It is not 'Behavior' because the post goes beyond planning or preparation to describe an actual initiated act.

11,"Having a lot of suicidal thoughts but I dont think im depressed. Throwaway because people I know, know my main acc. Turned 17 in Jan. Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" and repeated expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""eternal sleep? Sign me up please"").
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (questioning life's purpose) and anhedonia (emptiness after temporary happiness).
   - **No mention** of a specific plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means).
   - References to deterrents (e.g., impact on family/friends/dog) but **no negation of the desire to die itself**; the desire is explicitly affirmed.
   - **No description** of past/current suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, self-harm). The robbery incident is unrelated to self-initiated lethal behavior.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""it would be better if I was dead,"" and ""eternal sleep? Sign me up"" confirm a personal desire to die. Deterrents (e.g., guilt) contextualize conflict but do not negate the underlying desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No**: Absence of any stated plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations. The post focuses solely on thoughts/desire and moral conflicts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes **current** suicidal ideation. **No mention** of past/ongoing suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). The robbery event was external and non-suicidal.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Strong evidence of **personal desire to die** (suicidal thoughts + explicit wish for death), ruling out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** described, ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - **No initiated self-harm action**, ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - Conflicts/deterrents do not diminish the expressed desire, aligning with *Ideation*.

It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain .

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:

   - Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** threshold met) + specific method/means (**Behavior** threshold met).  
   - No initiated lethal action (ruling out **Attempt**).  
   - **Behavior** fits best due to the conjunction of suicidal intent, stated plan (overdose), and possession of means.

   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.
   - Emotional indicators: The author alludes to ""mental health or lack of,"" which suggests general distress, but the tone is focused on positive coping (e.g., music providing distraction and contentment). No explicit hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, or feelings of being a burden are present.
   - No indications of plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions.

   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar. The song title ""the one who gave up"" is shared but not as a personal statement—it's framed as an example of music the author finds comforting. There is no clear desire to die expressed by the author for themselves.

The focus is on coping mechanisms, and the song title does not translate to the author's own intent. This fits the 'Indicator' category, which covers distress or abstract discussions without explicit suicidal desire. There is no ambiguity pushing toward 'Ideation' (e.g., no ""I want to die"" statements), and no elements of 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

I didn't text him the rest of the day because I was trying to recollect myself and I know he's busy working. \n\nHe later texted me that he was worried the whole day. I called him to let him know I was doing better and let him know what happened. \n\nNow I feel guilty for worrying him and he said his head hurt and he's going to sleep. Maybe he won't say anything but I feel like I worried him for nothing. Now I feel like I should stop texting him for a few days because I honestly feel like a burden. \n\nI can't keep it all to myself. I end up going to a dark place and feel alone. I self-harmed one time a from anxiety and guilt that snowballed. I feel those thoughts creeping up and I really don't want it to lead to that. \n\nI also just have a hard time opening up to friends. Mostly because I feel like there needs a place and time. I'm getting better at opening up more and more but it takes time and mental health discussions are something that I haven't worked towards yet. It's probably the hardest obstacle for me.\n\nThere's no way I can afford any therapy to help with these habits right now. I don't have a summer job and I'm going to college in the fall so I may have to save some money or something.\n\nI suppose I can try counseling again at the university.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions feeling like a burden, guilt, anxiety, isolation (""feel alone""), and past self-harm (""self-harmed one time"").  
   - References ""dark place"" and ""thoughts creeping up"" (likely referring to self-harm/suicidal thoughts) but explicitly states **""I really don't want it to lead to that""**.  
   - No explicit mention of death, suicide, methods, plans, or preparations. No temporal urgency (e.g., ""tonight"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes a **past non-lethal action** (self-harm due to anxiety/guilt). No recent/ongoing potentially lethal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Core themes are distress, guilt, isolation, and unwanted self-harm/suicidal thoughts.  
   - **No personal desire to die** expressed; suicidal thoughts are framed as **unwanted and resisted**.

19,I'm a pervert. Should I kill myself? I've never done anything wrong or illegal. I'm just a pervert. I can't help my sexual feelings. I want to die because of them.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes direct phrases like ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die because of them,"" expressing personal distress about sexual feelings. There is explicit mention of suicide and a desire to die. No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The author references no past suicidal actions, only current feelings of hopelessness and being a ""pervert."" Imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is not indicated. The desire to die is stated clearly and personally.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die because of them""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The post focuses on thoughts and desires without concrete suicidal planning. This absence means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die""), with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interrupted actions, or failures). The statement ""I've never done anything wrong or illegal"" refers to sexual behavior, not suicide, and confirms no past lethal actions. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""want to die""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no clear desire). The lack of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. With no described past or recent initiated lethal actions, 'Attempt' is not relevant. Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' due to the presence of suicidal desire without specifics on how or when it might be carried out.

   - Discusses future intent (""could be dead today"") but **no past/current initiated lethal action**. Fatigue prevents acting on plans.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator** is ruled out due to explicit personal desire to die.  
   - **Attempt** is absent: No description of past/recent initiated lethal action.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Desire to die is present, *and* a specific method (gas) + preparation step (buying it) are mentioned. This meets 'Behavior' criteria.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicidal intent: ""Im going to to kms right now"" (abbreviation for ""kill myself"") and ""Is it worth to end it?""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I want to end ittt""), despair (""Its not fair,"" ""i wish i was normal""), self-loathing (""Im complately dumb stupid retard""), and isolation (""lonely,"" ""loner"").  
   - References to past self-harm (""i self harmed"") and current substance use (drinking, smoking) are present, but no specific suicide method, plan, or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) is mentioned for the *current* suicidal urge.  
   - The phrase ""kms right now"" suggests imminence, but no concrete actionable steps (method/location) are described.  
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die (""I want to end ittt"") without stating these thoughts are unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kms"" (kill myself) and ""end it"" confirm explicit suicidal intent from the author.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While past self-harm and substance use are noted, no specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping) or active preparations (e.g., ""bought a rope,"" ""wrote a note"") are tied to the *current* intent (""kms right now"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a current/future intention (""kms right now"") but no description of a past or recent *initiated, potentially lethal action* by the author. Past self-harm is mentioned but lacks context confirming it was a suicide attempt versus non-suicidal self-injury.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit personal desire to die (""kms,"" ""end it"").  
   - **Behavior**: Ruled out—no plan/method/preparation described for the current intent.  
   - **Attempt**: Ruled out—no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action.  
   - **Ideation**: Fits best—clear desire to die (""kms right now,"" ""I want to end ittt"") without evidence of a specific plan, method, or preparation.

22,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts: ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't,"" and ""when I do [talk to my parents] I feel like killing myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it""), isolation, and feeling like a burden.  
   - There is **no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., pills, hanging), preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note), or timeline** for acting on suicidal thoughts.  
   - The author explicitly states they lack the courage to act (""I don't have the guts"") and frames their suicidal desire as hypothetical or unactionable.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described; the post only references *unacted* desires.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post directly expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"").  
   - The author does **not** frame these thoughts as unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""I don’t want these thoughts""). Instead, they lament their inability to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.  
   - References to suicide are abstract (e.g., ""kill myself"") without concrete planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **past and ongoing suicidal ideation** but explicitly denies any attempt: ""I've never actually attempted.""  
   - No initiated actions (interrupted, failed, or otherwise) are reported.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") and personal ownership of suicidal thoughts place this beyond **Indicator** (which requires no genuine desire to die).  
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - The denial of past attempts (""never actually attempted"") rules out **Attempt**.  
   - The core content aligns with **Ideation**: persistent suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without actionable plans or behaviors.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions urges to ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" which imply suicidal thoughts.  
   - Strong emotional indicators: ""screaming at me,"" ""defeated,"" ""torture cycle,"" hopelessness about escaping (""I'll never be out"").  
   - **No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines (e.g., ""tonight""), or past actions described.**  
   - The suicidal thoughts are framed as intrusive/unwanted (""my brain is screaming at me"") rather than a embraced desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - Desires are implied (""get it over with"") but **not directly stated as a personal wish to die**. The writer focuses on distress about recurring urges (""every time I am back here"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **explicitly attributed to the brain as an unwanted force** (""my brain is screaming at me""), indicating distress *about* the thoughts, not endorsement.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **current mental state** (""now my brain is screaming"") but **no past/ongoing actions** (e.g., ""tried,"" ""took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses distress, hopelessness, and *unwanted* suicidal urges but **lacks a clear, personal desire to die** (e.g., ""I want to die"" is absent).  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** → rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No initiated lethal action** → rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Ambiguity between *Indicator* (unwanted thoughts + distress) and *Ideation* (desire to die): The framing of thoughts as intrusive (""brain screaming"") and absence of personal ownership of the desire aligns more closely with **Indicator** per the rule: *""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""*

24,'I wish I had people around me who love me. I have a very humanistic side and I love human beings but there is no one around me to love me back. I need emotional support so much. depression is my fate. removed',0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses feelings of loneliness, a lack of reciprocal love, a strong need for emotional support, and a sense of hopelessness (""depression is my fate""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, but no references to suicidal thoughts, plans, preparations, or past actions. The word ""removed"" is ambiguous but does not alter the core emotional content. The primary sentiment is distress about unmet emotional needs, not a desire for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or a clear desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die""). The writer focuses on wanting love and support, implying a desire for connection rather than an end to life. Suicidal thoughts are not present, so this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No specific suicide plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no references to pills, notes, or goodbyes). The absence of these elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post describes current emotional states, not past or future suicidal actions. There is no description of initiated self-harm or attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post shows general distress and hopelessness (common in 'Indicator') but lacks any explicit personal desire for suicide, plan, or action. While ""depression is my fate"" indicates despair, it does not convey suicidal ideation. Since there is no expression of wanting to die, and ambiguity would default to 'Indicator', this category is appropriate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""I just want to get it over with"" – implying a desire to end suffering, likely through death.  
   - Expresses despair (""deteriorating,"" ""can't tell anyone""), hopelessness, and fear of institutionalization.  
   - Explicitly fears ""the pain if I go through with it"" – confirming suicidal intent (""it"" refers to suicide).  
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - No past actions or attempts mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. ""Get it over with"" + ""if I go through with it"" directly implies a desire to die by suicide. The fear of pain confirms ""it"" is a suicidal act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Discusses current/future intention (""go through with it""), but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die is present (""get it over with""), meeting criteria for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No described past actions rule out **Attempt**.  
   - Suicidal intent is personal and current, ruling out **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states: ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead,"" indicating a strong personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""fuck that,"" ""kills me inside""), anger toward family, and feeling betrayed.  
   - Specific method: Daily heroin use is mentioned, which is a potentially lethal substance. The phrase ""Soon I will be finally dead"" implies using heroin as a means to achieve death.  
   - Preparation: Ongoing heroin use (""started to do heroin pretty much daily"") suggests active engagement with a method.  
   - Temporal context: ""Soon"" and ""within 4 weeks"" imply imminence, but no past or recent *initiated* lethal action (e.g., overdose attempt) is described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead"" are direct expressions of a desire to die. No negation of this desire is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. Heroin use is a specific, potentially lethal method tied to the desire to die (""Soon I will be finally dead""). Daily use indicates ongoing preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current/future intentions with heroin as a method but no past or recent *initiated* lethal action (e.g., ""I overdosed yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (Ideation) + **specific method/preparation** (daily heroin use) = **Behavior**.  
   - No concrete past/current *action* (e.g., overdose attempt) is mentioned, ruling out ""Attempt.""

27,"Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow. But I will, as always. Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again. Tired of being alone.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses a wish not to wake up (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow""), indicating a desire for death. It references a past suicide attempt with ""attempt properly again,"" implying a prior initiated action. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""But I will, as always""), depression linked to an event (Christmas), and loneliness. There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for the future attempt (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes). The temporal context includes a past action (attempt) and a future intention (""that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again""), but no imminent timeframe like ""tonight"" is specified.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the phrase ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" expresses a clear personal desire to die. The mention of ""attempt properly again"" reinforces suicidal intent without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned for the future attempt. The reference to ""attempt"" is vague and lacks details about means or planning, so it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past event: ""attempt properly again"" indicates a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that occurred previously. This qualifies as a suicide attempt under the definition, even if not detailed. The future ideation (""to attempt properly again"") is secondary to the clear description of past action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to explicit suicidal desire. It lacks a current plan or method for future actions, ruling out Behavior. The mention of a past suicide attempt (""attempt properly again"") takes precedence over current ideation. According to the rules, if a past attempt is described, it should be classified as 'Attempt', even with concurrent ideation. The phrase ""attempt properly again"" confirms a concrete, initiated action in the past.

28,i feel so unwanted i just wanna disappear from this universe',1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of being unwanted and a desire to ""disappear from this universe."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i feel so unwanted"") and a wish to escape (""disappear""), but no explicit suicidal language. No plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions are present. The imminence is not specified, and the desire to ""disappear"" is vague—it could indicate distress rather than a genuine wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The phrase ""disappear from this universe"" is metaphorical and does not clearly express a desire to die; it could reflect a wish to escape emotional pain without suicidal intent. There is no statement that suicidal thoughts are unwanted because no suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned. Leaning toward 'Indicator' due to the absence of explicit suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned. The content is focused on feelings only, with no planning elements. Thus, if there were ideation, it would not escalate to 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings (""i feel,"" ""i just wanna"") with no reference to past or recent actions. No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post indicates general distress and hopelessness but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. Phrases like ""disappear"" are ambiguous and not explicitly suicidal; they could represent a cry for help or emotional overwhelm rather than ideation. According to the rules, if there is ambiguity between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', 'Indicator' should be chosen. No plan or method is present, ruling out 'Behavior', and no past action, ruling out 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Indicator' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains direct mentions of suicide: ""I'm about to commit suicide"" and ""I want to die."" These indicate a personal desire to end life.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I can't go on,"" ""I'm stuck like this""), regret, and feelings of abandonment (""People automatically give up on me,"" ""They just leave me"").
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The phrase ""about to"" suggests imminence but lacks concrete details on timing or how the act would be carried out.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts are present; regrets are about life events, not self-harm.
   - The desire to die is explicit and personal, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" and ""I want to die,"" showing a clear, current desire to die from the author's perspective.
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement that the author doesn't want these thoughts), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. ""Commit suicide"" is a general statement without details on means or planning.
   - Without explicit evidence of a plan or preparation, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (""I'm about to commit suicide"") but does not describe any past or recent initiated suicidal action (e.g., no reference to an attempt that was started and stopped). Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts place this above 'Indicator', which requires a lack of personal suicidal intent.
   - The absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior' (which requires such elements).
   - With no description of a past or recent initiated lethal action, it cannot be 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation', as the author expresses a clear desire to die with suicidal thoughts but no indication of a plan or method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains multiple explicit expressions of suicidal intent: ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" ""I want to be dead,"" ""how much I want to kill myself/die.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""It will never be better""), despair (""I hate this world""), self-loathing (""hate myself""), and perceived burden (repeated rejection).  
   - The author references a past incident where he ""chickened out"" of acting on suicidal thoughts but expresses regret over not dying in a traffic accident. However, the near-accident was incidental (not self-initiated) and he explicitly states he lacks the strength to act now or in the foreseeable future.  
   - No specific plan, method, tools, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are mentioned. The desire for passive death (e.g., wishing for a fatal accident) lacks active planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases like ""I want to kill myself so bad"" and ""I want to be dead"" confirm a personal desire to die. The thoughts are not framed as unwanted or resisted; they are actively endorsed.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. While the author wishes for death (e.g., via traffic accident), there is no description of a self-initiated plan, method, or preparation. Regret over ""chickening out"" implies past contemplation but no actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The incident at the crossroads was a passive wish for death, not a self-initiated action. The author explicitly states: ""I dont feel I will have strenght to do it now or in foreseeable future,"" indicating no imminent intent or recent concrete action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator** is ruled out due to explicit personal desire to die.  
   - **Behavior** requires a plan/method/preparation, which is absent.  
   - **Attempt** requires a past/current *self-initiated, potentially lethal action*; the traffic incident was incidental, not intentional.  
   - **Ideation** fits: The post expresses a persistent desire to die and suicidal thoughts but lacks evidence of a plan, method, or preparatory steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/suicide: Explicitly states ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Expresses hopelessness (""nothing fills the hole""), loneliness (""feel like a creature""), disconnection (""on the moon""), and distress about bullying.  
   - Plans/methods/preparations: **None mentioned**. No tools, locations, substances, or preparatory actions (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are referenced.  
   - Past actions: Refers to past concealment of feelings (""tried to hide this"") but **no description of a past suicidal act or attempt**.  
   - Imminence: No time-bound intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire to die: Explicitly states thinking about suicide daily but does *not* negate the desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, explicitly mentions ""thinking about suicide"" as a personal, current experience.  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""thinking about suicide everyday"" indicates a genuine (not unwanted) preoccupation with suicide.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, plan, or preparation** is described. The post focuses on recurring thoughts and emotional pain without actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing ideation (""everyday"") and past emotional concealment, but **no past/current suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits:  
     - Explicit personal desire to die/thoughts of suicide (""thinking about suicide everyday"").  
     - No plan/method/preparation (rules out *Behavior*).  
     - No past/recent suicidal action (rules out *Attempt*).  
     - The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted/distressing without intent (rules out *Indicator*).

This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions death/dying (""Is there a painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever,"" ""how to die"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm tired,"" ""feel worthless,"" ""the world scares me""), guilt (""I'm so selfish""), and anhedonia (""unmotivated,"" ""stay in my room"").  
   - The author expresses a **desire to die** but explicitly states uncertainty about methods (""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain""). No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - No past actions (e.g., attempts) are described.  
   - The desire to die is personal and current (""I want to sleep forever""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever,"" and ""how to die"" reflect a direct desire to not be alive. The author does not negate or express distress about *having* these thoughts (e.g., no ""I don’t want to feel this way"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan/method/preparation**: While the author asks about ""painless ways,"" they explicitly state uncertainty (""I don’t know how"") and mention no concrete tools, locations, or steps taken. This is generalized inquiry, not a stated plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described. The focus is on current feelings and hypothetical questions about dying.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a **clear desire to die** (suicidal thoughts) but lacks any mention of a plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with **Ideation**.  
   - Distinction from *Indicator*: The author’s personal desire to die (""I want to sleep forever"") is explicit, moving beyond general distress or abstract discussion of suicide.  
   - Distinction from *Behavior*: No plan/method is specified (e.g., ""I’ve researched X method"" or ""I have pills"").  
   - *Attempt* is irrelevant, as no past/current actions are described.

There is no escape from the everlasting flames of life, death is the only escape.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"" and ""death is the only escape,"" indicating direct references to suicide and death.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""too far gone""), despair (""no escape from the everlasting flames of life""), and increasing distress (""thoughts are intense and are seemingly only getting more intense"").
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - There are no references to past actions, such as initiated suicide attempts.
   - The temporal context is ongoing (""as the days pass,"" ""wake immediately""), but no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire for death as a solution (""death is the only escape""), with no indication that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" which is a direct phrase related to suicide.
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""death is the only escape,"" indicating a personal wish not to be alive.
   - The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not desire to act on them; instead, death is framed as the solution to distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned or implied.
   - The content focuses on thoughts and emotions, with no evidence of planning or concrete steps toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and feelings (e.g., ""wake immediately with suicidal thoughts""), with a general sense of worsening over time (""as the days pass"").
   - There is no description of any past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions). The focus is solely on thoughts and internal experiences.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (""death is the only escape"") and suicidal thoughts, which rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no clear desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - This aligns with 'Ideation': the author expresses a current desire to die and suicidal thoughts, but without any specific plan or preparatory steps.

34,"Zoloft overdose. So at 11:30 I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg and It obviously wasn't enough to kill me, I feel completely fine now apart from slight nausea and I'm really sweaty, will I be okay if I don't go to hospital?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions a ""Zoloft overdose"" and describes taking 6 pills (300mg) at a specific time (11:30). It states the action was insufficient to cause death, with current symptoms (nausea, sweating), and asks about avoiding hospital care.
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""overdose"" implies intent to die, reinforced by ""wasn't enough to kill me,"" indicating a desire for lethal outcome.
   - Emotional indicators: Despair is implied through the act, but no explicit emotional language (e.g., hopelessness) is present.
   - Plan/method/preparation: Specific method (pills, dosage) and action (taking pills) are described. No mention of prior planning (e.g., note, goodbye), but the act itself is preparation-executed.
   - Past actions: Describes a concrete past action (""I took 6 pills"") that was initiated and self-completed, albeit with non-lethal results.
   - Imminence: Action occurred at a specified past time, with current concern about health.
   - Stated desire: The phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" confirms a genuine wish to die, not unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""overdose"" is a direct reference to self-harm with suicidal intent, and ""wasn't enough to kill me"" explicitly expresses a desire for death. No indication of unwanted thoughts or negation of intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (Zoloft pills) and dosage (300mg) are mentioned. The act of taking the pills constitutes preparation and execution.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past, concrete action (taking pills at 11:30) that was self-initiated and potentially lethal (overdose). It failed (""wasn't enough to kill me""), but the action was completed. This aligns with the 'Attempt' category, which includes failed or interrupted actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - This is not 'Indicator' because there is explicit personal suicidal intent (desire to die through overdose).
   - Not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond thoughts/desire; a specific method was used in action.
   - Not 'Behavior' because the post describes an initiated, potentially lethal action (taking pills), not just planning or preparation.
   - Fits 'Attempt': The author describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (overdose) that failed. The definition includes actions that do not result in death, and the past action takes precedence over any current concerns.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense anger, hopelessness, and despair about physical appearance (""daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body,"" ""unwanted in literally all facets of life"").  
   - It references societal attitudes toward suicide (""obsession with preventing people from the act of killing themselves but nobody really cares about everything leading up to that"") but **does not mention personal suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions**.  
   - The phrase ""I would fucking jump out of bed every morning"" is metaphorical (expressing envy) and unrelated to self-harm.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, self-harm, or a personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - The writer's distress focuses on resentment toward attractive people and societal neglect of root causes—**not personal suicidal intent**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No indications** of a plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks personal expressions of suicidal desire, plans, or actions**.  
   - Mentions of suicide are abstract/societal (""preventing people from the act of killing themselves"")—**not personal**.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: General distress without current personal suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of self-harm and suicide: ""I just slit my wrists,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" and detailed descriptions of method (targeting the radial artery with a dremel saw attachment). 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I am not a good person,"" ""my death will only benefit people"") and despair (""I have been so distant to everyone,"" ""I just want to get it over with"").
   - Specific plans and preparations are evident: researching artery location, marking the spot, using a dremel with a saw attachment, and pre-typing the post to be shared after the act.
   - References to past actions: ""I just slit my wrists"" indicates a recently completed action, and the statement ""if you are seeing this then its already too late"" confirms the action was initiated before posting.
   - Imminence is high, as the action is described as just completed or ongoing at the time of posting.
   - The writer expresses a clear and resolute desire to die, with no indication of ambivalence or unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly describes self-harm (""slit my wrists"") and implies suicide through phrases like ""my death"" and ""it's already too late."" There is a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I just want to get it over with""), with no negation of intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (cutting wrists with a dremel saw targeting the radial artery) and preparations are detailed (researching anatomy, marking the artery, assembling tools). This goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past/recent action: ""I just slit my wrists"" is past tense, indicating the act was initiated. The phrase ""if you are seeing this then its already too late"" reinforces that a concrete, potentially lethal action has been completed. This is not just planning for the future; it is an account of an action taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content is not 'Indicator' because there is explicit suicidal intent and desire to die, not general distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because a specific method and preparations are mentioned, moving beyond mere thoughts or desires.
   - It is not 'Behavior' because the post describes an action that has already been initiated (""I just slit my wrists""), not just planning or preparation for a future act.
   - It fits 'Attempt' because the author describes a self-initiated, potentially lethal action (cutting wrists) that was carried out, as evidenced by the past-tense description and the context of the post being shared afterward.

   - No past or recent actions (e.g., attempts) are described; the focus is on persistent thoughts and despair.  
   - Temporal context: The suicidal feelings are ongoing (""constantly suicidal""), but no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: The author explicitly states, ""I want to kill myself"" and ""constantly suicidal,"" expressing a personal desire to die. ""Assisted suicide"" reinforces this desire.  
   - The thoughts are not framed as unwanted or resisted; instead, they are presented as a barrier to recovery.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described. The post focuses solely on current thoughts and emotional distress.

   - **Method**: ""Blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger"" imply a specific method (firearm).  
   - **Plan/Preparation**: No evidence of planning steps (e.g., accessing a gun, choosing a location).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing urges but **no past/current initiated action** (""can never bring myself to actually do it"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die (rules out Indicator).  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated lethal action.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**:  
     - *Ideation* requires desire to die without plan/method.  
     - *Behavior* requires desire **plus** method/plan/preparation.  
     - **Specific method (""blow my brains out""/""pull the trigger"") is mentioned**, meeting the threshold for Behavior.  
   - Ambivalence (fear, reluctance) doesn’t negate the presence of a method.

40,"I did a horrible thing to the woman I love. We started off a bit complicated, my mum is dying from cancer and at the start I told her that I cant commit to a relationship because I wasn't in the right headspace. That was fine at first but she wanted more and so did i. But I was weak and looked for comfort in an ex. I put a stop to it again and again but everytime something got hard with my family I kept running to the other woman for support. I knew it was wrong and I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much. We were together for two years. But she found out about the previous incident and left. I am fully responsible for everything that happened. Im so regretful and sorry for hurting her. My mum is in her final couple of weeks, im her primary carer and I dont know how to process any of it. She will be leaving my little brother who is autistic in my care. I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously. I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicide history: ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness: ""I don't see any future ahead for me.""  
   - Explicit future suicidal intent: ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well"" and ""I regret all the pain I ever caused and I'm so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing.""  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes).  
   - No description of recent/imminent actions initiated (e.g., no ""tried last night"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I will be joining her [after death]"" and ""pain I will cause with my passing"" directly express a personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past suicide attempt is referenced (""hospitalised for it""), but the post focuses on **future** intent (""once my mum passes I will be joining her"").  
   - No description of a recent/initiated action (e.g., ""tried today"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a clear **desire to die** (future intent) and references past suicidal behavior, but lacks any plan/method/preparation details.  
   - Past hospitalization for suicide is a historical *Attempt*, but the **current content** centers on *future* suicidal desire without a plan.  
   - Rules prioritize current risk: ""If a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' **only if the past action is clearly described**."" Here, the past attempt is vague (""struggled,"" ""hospitalised""), while the explicit future intent (""I will be joining her"") dominates.  
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - Explicit personal desire to die rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Conclusion**: *Ideation* (suicidal desire with no plan/method).

41,Life is worse than death. Right now i have so many bad memories and thoughts in my head and nobody listens to me and my dad just yells at me and gives off this feeling of being tired of me and my mother is always occupied with her boyfriend and doesn't give a flying fuck about me. I have this hoplessness feeling like i'm stuck inside of a nightmare but i don't wake up and ugh. i'm sorry but right now i'm considering suicide because i can't fucking take it anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicide"" explicitly: ""i'm considering suicide because i can't fucking take it anymore."" It also expresses strong emotional distress, including hopelessness (""i have this hoplessness feeling""), despair (""stuck inside of a nightmare""), and feelings of being a burden or neglected (e.g., family issues). There are no references to specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes). No past or recent suicidal actions are described. The temporal context is present-focused (""right now""), but there is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer states they are ""considering suicide,"" which suggests a current thought process but not an explicit desire to die or act immediately.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in a personal context (""i'm considering suicide""). It expresses a desire to escape suffering (e.g., ""Life is worse than death""), which implies a preference for death over current life, but it does not clearly state an active, current wish to die (e.g., no phrase like ""I want to die now""). The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or resisted; they are presented as a response to distress. This leans away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plan, method, tools, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no details on how, when, or where suicide might occur). The phrase ""considering suicide"" indicates thoughts but no concrete steps. Without any plan/method, this does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and suicidal thoughts (""right now i'm considering""), with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no descriptions of initiated self-harm or attempts). This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows explicit personal suicidal ideation (""considering suicide"") without a plan, method, or preparation, fitting 'Ideation'. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' because the suicide consideration is personal and not abstract or unwanted (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to act on these thoughts""). There is no evidence of planning for 'Behavior' or past actions for 'Attempt'. The key distinction is that 'Ideation' captures the desire/thoughts without actionable steps.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Explicit phrases: ""i'll do it"" (contextually suicide), ""want my life to end."" No negation of desire. **Yes**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post begins with an explicit statement: ""Im thinking of ending my life.""  
   - Mentions emotional distress (depression, panic attacks, feeling abandoned by friends, hopelessness about education/career).  
   - References past events (OCD onset, school expulsion, vocational enrollment) but **no specific method, plan, or preparation** for suicide.  
   - No indication of past self-harm actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").  
   - Temporal context focuses on current feelings (""Right now i hate my course"") and unresolved distress.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Im thinking of ending my life"" directly expresses a personal desire to die.  
   - The author does not negate this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method, tools, location, or preparations** are mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - General distress about life circumstances dominates, but no actionable suicide plan is described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past hardships** (school struggles, friend loss) and **current ideation** (""thinking of ending my life"").  
   - **No mention of initiated self-harm actions** (past or recent).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""ending my life"") qualifies for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of method/preparation rules out **Behavior**; absence of past actions rules out **Attempt**.

I've fucked my education up, I've fucked my relationships with other people up, I've fucked up everything in my life. I simply won't live a comfortable life in the slightest, it'll only continue to get worse as it always has. At the stage I'm at, I don't even want to live a comfortable life anymore, I don't want any more chances. I just want the pain to stop. I'm only 16 and I've gone through enough of it to last multiple lifetimes. I'm too afraid to use any method aside from a gun to the head, though. Going by my plan, I still need to wait another 480 days until I'm able to. But I can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Mentions explicit desire to die: ""how and when I'm going to take my life,"" ""I just want the pain to stop.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I can't see myself going on""), despair (""I've fucked everything up""), and anhedonia (""I don't want any more chances"").  
   - **Specific method mentioned:** ""gun to the head"" and ""grab a kitchen knife.""

I can't tell anyone how I'm actually feeling because I know that it would push them away and they couldn't help in the first place. I've always had a solution to my issues when I was younger, like putting a bandaid on a scratch or finding a way to get out of detention. Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide. You can't fix that shit.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""entire life will be filled with misery and pain""), despair (""I feel unwanted""), anhedonia (""not motivated to do anything""), and social isolation (""none of my friends like me""). Crucially, it explicitly mentions ""the thought of suicide"" as a current personal struggle. No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions are described. The focus is on the *existence* of suicidal thoughts as an unsolvable problem (""You can't fix that shit"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention: Yes (""thought of suicide"").  
   - Clear desire to die: Not explicitly stated; the emphasis is on the *presence* of suicidal thoughts rather than a declared wish to act.  
   - Unwanted thoughts: Not negated (no phrases like ""but I don’t want to die"").  
   → **Leans toward Ideation** due to explicit personal acknowledgment of suicidal thoughts without rejection of desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation mentioned.  
   → **Absence supports Ideation over Behavior**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current emotional state and thoughts.  
   - No past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""tried,"" ""took,"" or ""attempted"").  
   → **Not Attempt**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit personal suicidal thoughts (""thought of suicide"") are present, satisfying **Ideation** criteria.  
   - No plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/current self-initiated lethal action rules out **Attempt**.  
   - While distress is severe, the explicit suicidal thought (without disavowal of desire) distinguishes this from **Indicator**.

I was ugly before but *damn*""",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions a desire for death through being murdered (""being murdered is clearly the best option"") and references suicidal thoughts indirectly with ""do myself in."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""it would make everything so much easier""), self-deprecation (""too much of a coward,"" ""clumsy idiot""), and distress (crying, feeling ""ugly""). There is no specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide described—only a passive wish for external harm. No past suicidal actions are mentioned; all content is hypothetical or expressive of current feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly references suicide with phrases like ""do myself in"" (a euphemism for suicide) and expresses a clear personal desire to not be alive (e.g., ""being murdered is clearly the best option""). However, the author states they are ""too much of a coward to try to do myself in,"" indicating they do not intend to act on suicidal thoughts due to fear. This suggests the suicidal thoughts are present but not desired in a way that implies imminent action, leaning toward distress about the thoughts rather than a firm commitment to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The references to ""being murdered"" involve a passive, external event, not a self-initiated plan. The phrase ""do myself in"" is vague and lacks concrete details about means. Without any indication of planning or preparation, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and hypothetical scenarios (e.g., ""I wish they would come true"" about delusions leading to murder). There is no mention of past or recent suicidal actions initiated by the author, such as an attempt or preparatory step. All content is focused on thoughts and desires, not behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""being murdered is clearly the best option"") and explicit suicidal thoughts (""do myself in""), meeting the criteria for 'Ideation'. However, the author negates any intent to act due to fear (""too much of a coward to try""), which aligns with 'Indicator' when suicidal thoughts are explicitly unwanted or not representing a current desire to act. The primary sentiment is distress about the inability to act on suicidal thoughts, and there is no plan or method, so 'Ideation' is less fitting than 'Indicator'. Vague or passive wishes for death (like hoping for murder) without self-initiated intent also fall under 'Indicator'. Since the desire to die is coupled with a clear statement of inaction, and no plan exists, 'Indicator' is the best fit based on the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""

I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions ""I'm suicidal again"" - explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""thought I was getting better but...""), guilt (""hurting my significant other""), fear (""scared to stress him"").
   - No specific method, plan, tool, location, or preparation described (e.g., no pills/weapons mentioned as means; ""run out of meds"" is a contextual stressor, not a plan to use them for suicide).
   - No references to past actions or attempts.
   - No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
   - Stated desire: Explicitly expresses current suicidal feelings without negation (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I'm suicidal again,"" indicating personal desire/thoughts. No disavowal of the thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No**: ""Run out of meds"" is a stressor, not a method/plan. No tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) mentioned.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes current emotional state and suicidal thoughts. No past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - ""I'm suicidal again"" confirms **Ideation** (explicit personal desire/thoughts).
   - Lacks plan/method/preparation → Not **Behavior**.
   - No past/recent initiated lethal action → Not **Attempt**.
   - Explicit suicidal desire rules out **Indicator** (which requires absence of personal desire or unwanted thoughts only).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""end it,"" which directly implies suicide. Key emotional indicators include hopelessness (""my life has been getting worse,"" ""I can't go on anymore""), despair (""I'm so lonely,"" ""I fucked up my life""), anhedonia (""I miss being happy""), and isolation (""I haven't been able to see my friends for years""). 
   - There is a temporal element with ""tonight,"" indicating imminent intent. The phrase ""end it"" suggests a desire to die, but no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is explicitly stated. The context of being drunk may lower inhibitions but does not constitute a method or preparation. 
   - No references to past suicidal actions are present; the focus is on current feelings and future intention.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use exact phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide in this context of despair. 
   - It expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""end it""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated. 
   - This confirms explicit suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., tool, substance, location) is mentioned; ""end it"" is vague and unspecific. 
   - No preparations are described (e.g., writing a note, gathering means); being drunk is a current state but not a preparatory act for suicide. 
   - The temporal context ""tonight"" implies a plan but lacks explicit details on how the act will be carried out. Since the method is not specified, and per the rules, if unsure, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight I'm just gonna... end it"") with no mention of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that was started but stopped). 
   - This is prospective and not based on a concrete past event, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'. 
   - The lack of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (e.g., no mention of how ""end it"" will be done). 
   - No description of a past or recent initiated action rules out 'Attempt'. 
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': it expresses a personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but without a clear plan, method, or preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""end my life,"" ""kill myself"" (repeated twice), expressing a strong desire to die. It includes emotional indicators like hopelessness (""I never wanted to be here as a child and not now,"" ""I'm not fit for this world""), despair, and depression (""I'm just depressed""). There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), plans (e.g., when, where), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or past actions. The temporal context is present-focused, with no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The desire to die is stated directly and personally, with no negation or expression of these thoughts as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""end my life,"" indicating a clear, personal desire to die. There is no statement suggesting these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The content focuses solely on the desire to die, without details on how it might be carried out.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and intentions (""I just want to kill myself"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no reference to an attempt, interruption, or failure). It is entirely focused on present ideation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal desire to die qualifies this as beyond 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguity or unwanted thoughts). The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. No described past or recent lethal actions rule out 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the expressed suicidal thoughts and desire to die without concrete plans or actions.

I'm starting to fall behind in school work, I have barely any will or energy to do much and I'm stuck with people who hate me.\n\nI'm lucky enough to understand something the first time I read it but, I just can't do it. I try and try and try to but, It's just too much for me. It takes me 1-2 hours to even sit up in the morning. I have to get up at 5am just because of it. Doesn't help the in one of my classes I have everyone who either dislikes or makes fun of me. They're all really close with each other so it just feels like torture.\n\nI'm lucky enough to have two friends who give a damn about me. Me and my one friends vent to each other when we need to and my other friends likes to talk to me (even though I don't say much). I feel terrible for whining when I'm lucky to have them but, I just need someone to just hug for a while. With COVID spiking in my area that's not possible.\n\nSchools not a safe place, home's not a safe place, hell, even my own room isn't safe. My mom and her bf love to snoop around whenever I leave. Trying to get dirt on me for no reason. I try to talk to them about how they've been treating me but they don't listen. All that they do is threaten to kick me out. They mock and make fun of me for every single thing. Even when I get good grades and don't go out much.\n\nI need to talk to someone desperately but I can't. Not when I live here. I can't even go in secret because my mom and her bf need to know every little detail. If they find out my lying my situation would be way worse. I can't ask my friends for help, I don't think they can do much and I really don't want to put this on them. I refuse to make that mistake again.\n\nJust when will it end? When can I finally be happy? I don't have to have anyone or really anything, I just want to feel okay at least once. Maybe find someone who tolerates my existence.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""I don't know how much longer I can hang on,"" ""I'll just suffer til the day I die""), despair, and isolation.  
   - Key emotional indicators: Feeling overwhelmed (""It's just too much""), exhaustion (""takes me 1-2 hours to sit up""), worthlessness (""people who hate me,"" ""mock and make fun of me""), and lack of safety (""Schools not a safe place, home's not a safe place"").  
   - **Explicit suicidal intent**: The final sentence states, ""I hope I kill myself soon. It's for the best, anyways.""  
   - **No plan/method/preparation**: No mention of specific tools, locations, timelines, or actions taken (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  
   - **No past actions**: References to suffering are abstract; no description of prior suicide attempts.  
   - **Temporal context**: The desire is future-oriented (""soon"") with no indication of imminent action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I hope I kill myself soon,"" confirming a personal desire to die. The phrasing lacks ambivalence (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned. The post focuses on emotional pain, not logistics.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress and future desire (""soon"") but **no initiated action** (past or present).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The explicit desire to die (""kill myself soon"") rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: While suicidal intent is clear, there is **no plan, method, or preparation** mentioned. The phrase ""kill myself"" is a general declaration of intent without actionable details.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no description of past/current self-harm actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: Fits *Ideation* (explicit desire to die without specific plans).

52,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""jump off,"" ""jump out of my bedroom window,"" and references a specific location (bedroom window) and environmental factors (trees and mud below).  
   - Expresses building courage and a desire to act soon (""Hopefully I can do it soon"").  
   - No indication of unwanted thoughts or a desire to avoid acting; instead, the tone suggests active preparation and intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window"" in this context imply a clear desire for lethal self-harm.  
   - The statement ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" confirms a current personal desire to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method mentioned: jumping from a bedroom window.  
   - Details provided: location (bedroom window), environmental factors (trees and mud below), and active mental preparation (""getting more courage"").  
   - No past action described, but clear planning/preparation for future action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""do it soon"") with no description of past/initiated actions.  
   - Not an **Attempt** since no concrete lethal action was initiated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator** is ruled out: Explicit desire to die and specific method are present.  
   - **Ideation** is insufficient: The post includes a specific plan/method (jumping from a defined location with environmental rationale).  
   - **Behavior** fits: Suicidal desire is paired with a concrete method (window jump), location, and preparations (building courage).  
   - **Attempt** is ruled out: No description of past/initiated lethal action.

53,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses a strong desire to ""disappear"" and for the ""broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain."" There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and intense emotional pain (e.g., ""broken remainings,"" ""free from all this pain""), but no references to plans, preparations, methods, or past actions. The language is focused on escaping suffering rather than ending life. There is no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") mentioned. The writer's desire appears to be about relief from pain, not necessarily a wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases (No).
   - It does not express a clear, unambiguous desire to die or not be alive; phrases like ""disappear"" and ""be free from pain"" are metaphorical and open to interpretation, but they lack explicit suicidal intent (No).
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no statement about them being unwanted or negated. The primary sentiment is distress about pain, not a declaration of suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned or implied. The content remains abstract and focused on emotional state.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings (e.g., ""I just want"") with no reference to past or future actions. There is no description of any initiated suicidal behavior, attempt, or concrete action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress and a desire to escape pain but lacks explicit personal suicidal desire, plan, method, or action. The ambiguous language (e.g., ""disappear"") does not clearly indicate a wish to die, so it aligns with 'Indicator' per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" It does not meet the criteria for Ideation (which requires explicit desire to die), Behavior (which requires a plan/method), or Attempt (which requires described actions).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post asks about inpatient care for suicidal thoughts, but this is framed as a general question (""Did anyone having thoughts of suicide benefit...""), not a personal admission. 
   - Emotional indicators include distress (e.g., ""I can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do""), hopelessness about life circumstances, and a plea for help calming down. 
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means in a personal context. 
   - No references to specific plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions. 
   - No imminence of harm indicated; instead, the user expresses a desire to ""find the courage to actually live"" and ""figure out what steps to take."" 
   - The writer's stated desire is to live and seek help, not to die (e.g., ""genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"" and ""convincing myself I deserve to live"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" indirectly in a question about others, but there is no explicit personal statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I am suicidal."" 
   - The writer does not express a personal desire to die; instead, they emphasize wanting to live and seeking help. 
   - Any reference to suicidal thoughts is not presented as a current personal desire but as part of a query for coping strategies. 
   - This leans strongly toward 'Indicator' because the primary sentiment is distress about life and unwanted negative thoughts, without explicit suicidal intent from the author.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparation (e.g., writing a note) is mentioned. 
   - The focus is on seeking treatment (inpatient care, medication) to manage mental health, not on acting on suicidal thoughts. 
   - With no plan or method indicated, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings of distress and a need for help, but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are referenced. 
   - The phrase ""all I failed to do"" refers to life failures, not suicide-related behaviors. 
   - No initiated actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows general distress, hopelessness, and a struggle with self-worth, but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or behavior. 
   - The writer explicitly states a desire to live and seeks help, which aligns with 'Indicator' (distress without current personal suicidal intent). 
   - There is no evidence for 'Ideation' (no explicit personal suicidal thoughts or desire to die), 'Behavior' (no plan or method), or 'Attempt' (no past actions). 
   - Per the rule: If in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity, choose 'Indicator'. Here, the absence of personal suicidal desire and the focus on seeking help confirm 'Indicator'.

Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post explicitly discusses suicide with phrases like ""killing yourself soon"" and ""surprise em,"" indicating a personal consideration of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"") and a focus on the impact on others, but no explicit despair or burden statements.
   - No specific method, tool, location, or substance for suicide is mentioned (e.g., no reference to pills, weapons, or locations). The content centers on whether to announce the suicide, not on how it would be carried out.
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the discussion is future-oriented with terms like ""soon"" indicating imminence.
   - The writer expresses a desire to die (e.g., ""killing yourself soon"" is personal and not negated as unwanted).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing yourself"" in a personal context, indicating a clear desire to die.
   - No statements suggest the thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not intend to act; the tone is matter-of-fact about proceeding.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or tools are mentioned.
   - No signs of physical preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). The ""heads up"" is about communication, not a concrete step toward the act itself.
   - Without a plan or method, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""soon"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that was started or completed).
   - The content is speculative about timing and notification, not recounting a concrete event.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""killing yourself soon"") rules out 'Indicator', as there is no indication these thoughts are unwanted or abstract.
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
   - No description of a past or recent initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': it expresses a personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but lacks any mention of a plan, method, or preparations.

Been struggling way worse lately, half of it is my ""dad\'s"" fault (I put the quotations because I hate him he scares me) I took about two months leave of school because my mental health went down the drain, now I have to go back and I\'m supposed to be going back to school slowly but dad doesnt give two shits and throws me in like nothing happened. School has been so hard, I can\'t focus and the smallest things annoy me. Exampel; I sit by myself near the front of my science class cause I have no friends, one lesson a teacher sat next to me to work with another kid and she wouldnt stop tapping her leg. I, It annoyed me so much i couldnt focus and started ripping my page up with my pen and not doung work for the rest of the lesson. had a hass test and my neck, back and chest hurt and i got mad so i started leaninng against the desk as hard as i could to hurt my chest i couldnt do the wuiz and flunked it lurposley; even though i understanded some of the questions i didnt answer correctly. I wasnt always this angry but lately the littlest things make me so mad, when I cant move a tab on google so i can have two things open at once makes me want to hit the computer, my dad breathing loudly all the time, people shiffting their hands on their clothes and making noise pisses me off, mum and dad singing irritates  me plus they suck at it, ect. I hide in the toilets at school half the time, the no phone rule is shit, my phone is my safe space and break from reality and I cant even drown out those filthy fucking freaks with music. My classmates are racist, ableist and homophobic, they say slurs and everything. They say them so fucking loudly but what does the teacher do? NOTHING THEY FUCKING IGNORE IT WHAT THE FUCK, THIS IS WHY KIDS KILL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE TEACHERS LET THE ONLY DECENT CHILDREN BE SURROUNDED BY THESE FREAKS. Schoo is the main reason i want to kill myself its awfull, I\'m tired of people telling me to just ""push through it"" I understand thats the only option but i dont want to accept that, I want to be happy and learn not memorize things so I cant forget them. I\'m 13 and in year 9 and everything wer elearning is scary and I dont want to learn it because I dont need to use it. They get mad at me for not focusing when they teach the mist boring shit. I\'m so scared I\'m so scared I dont want ro kill myself but im so scated im going to act on my thoughts I dont want to die but I dont want to go to school. Does anyone relate? One last thing; I had a huge fallout with my ""dad"" because one night When i was about to go to sleep I heard  heavy breathing, it scared the shit out of me and rightfully so. I remembered the laundry door was unlocked so i got up to lock it, my dad woke up and asked what i was doing. I started bursting out in tears because I seriously thought i was goinng to die that night, he says its nothing and then i just go back to my room. Then he gets mad at me because im sitting up on my bed, like xcuse me? Im not going to go to bed immediately i just heard scary shit and burst out crying, i tokd him to shut up and go away because i was already mad at him from previous incidents. I sat for maybe anothee minute then dad comes outs, i had my flashlight on and dad thought i was in my ohone? Idk it was obvious i wasnt. He got really mad at me and tried to snatch my ohone away, he moved really fast and he was really scaring me. I took it before he could grab it and then he wouldnt leave me alone. I started crying really loudly because he was freaking me out he left after like two minutes of me telling hi mto get away from me, i was so fhcking scared he was going to hurt me ir poor boiling water on me. Then he brang it up the night after for no reason, he didnt even apologize. I ahte my dad hes the worst and makes me hncomfortable and makes me feel worthless. I know it was a small incident but it really hurt, i thought i was going to die that nught so that didnt help :( my mum didnt care about the situation and my friend and brother are the only people who seem to get mad about it and listen to me. Everything is just awfull, \n\n\n\nTl;dr: struggling with suicidal thoughts and not feeling prepared to spend four years in school.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts: ""struggling with suicidal thoughts,"" ""School is the main reason I want to kill myself,"" and ""scared I'm gonna kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""I'm tired of people telling me to just 'push through it'""), despair, anger, and fear.  
   - The author states a desire to die but also explicitly expresses *not wanting to act* on these thoughts: ""I don't want to kill myself,"" ""I don't want to die.""  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or steps to enact suicide).  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** are described (e.g., no references to initiated attempts). Self-harming behaviors (e.g., hurting chest by leaning on a desk) are mentioned but are non-lethal expressions of distress, not suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, direct phrases like ""want to kill myself"" and ""struggling with suicidal thoughts"" indicate a personal desire to die.  
   - **However**, the writer explicitly negates the desire to act: ""I don't want to kill myself,"" showing distress about *unwanted* thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No mention of specific means (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparations (e.g., writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current distress and fear of acting on thoughts** but **no past/initiated suicidal actions**. Self-harming incidents (e.g., hurting chest) lack suicidal intent or lethality.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicitly stated but countered by the writer's assertion they *do not want to act*.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No initiated lethal action → rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - The core conflict (desire to die vs. active rejection of acting) leans toward **'Ideation'** per guidelines: *explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die, but without a plan or preparation*.  
   - While distress is evident, the direct expression of suicidal intent (""want to kill myself"") distinguishes this from 'Indicator' (which requires *no personal desire to die*).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions severe distress (""rock bottom,"" ""nothing can pull me out,"" ""darkness everywhere"").  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""I don't see light,"" ""I want to go away"").  
   - Explicitly references suicidal methods: ""stab my head or slit my neck to forget it.""  
   - States desire to escape (""I should have died,"" ""I want to go away"") but explicitly negates intent to act: ""I'm too coward to end it myself.""  
   - No specific plan, preparation, timeline, or description of past actions initiated.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, phrases like ""stab my head,"" ""slit my neck,"" and ""end it myself"" indicate explicit suicidal ideation.  
   - **However**, the writer directly negates intent: ""too coward to end it myself,"" framing the thoughts as distressing but unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (stabbing/slitting) are mentioned but only as expressions of distress (""to forget it""), not as part of a plan. No tools, locations, or preparations described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - References past regret (""should have died way back"") but **no description of a concrete past action** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  
   - Current focus is on emotional pain and intrusive thoughts, not imminent action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are present but explicitly unwanted (""too coward to end it myself"").

Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post discusses a general scenario about threatening to call the police on someone who is described as ""passive suicidal"" and ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal."" It mentions ""suicide by cop"" as a potential outcome, which is a specific method.
   - Emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair are attributed to others (""passive suicidal""), not the author.
   - There is no mention of the author's personal feelings, desires, plans, methods, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. The focus is entirely on hypothetical others and societal behavior.
   - The language is advisory and abstract, with no indication of imminence or personal involvement from the author.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No, the post does not contain any explicit personal expressions of suicidal intent from the author. Phrases like ""suicide by cop"" and ""passive suicidal"" are used in a third-person context to discuss others, not the author themselves. The author expresses no desire to die or not be alive.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No, while ""suicide by cop"" is mentioned as a method, it is not attributed to the author. There is no indication of the author having a plan, method, or preparations for themselves. The reference is hypothetical and about others.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a hypothetical future scenario (""they may just think..."") with no reference to past or recent actions by the author. It does not describe any initiated suicidal actions by the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, behavior, or attempt from the author. It discusses suicide abstractly in the context of others, which aligns with the 'Indicator' category. The author's intent appears to be raising awareness or expressing distress about how others might react, not conveying their own risk. Since there is no ambiguity about personal suicidal desire (as none is expressed), and based on the rule to prioritize 'Indicator' when no personal intent is present, this fits 'Indicator'.

59,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post details multiple past suicide attempts by the author (swallowing sleeping pills at 16, cutting their neck in 2020, overdosing on prescriptions in 2020). Methods (pills, razor, overdose) and preparations (suicide note) are explicitly described. The author expresses a current desire not to live (""I don't want to live at all"") and references surviving these attempts as ""miracles."" The motorcycle incident is framed as accidental, not suicidal.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. The author explicitly states ""I don't want to live at all"" and confirms ""some of these are suicide attempts,"" directly personalizing the desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Methods (pills, razor, overdose) and preparation (suicide note) are mentioned, but these are tied to **past actions**, not current/future plans. The current sentiment lacks new plans/methods.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post describes **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions** (swallowing pills, cutting neck, overdosing) that were interrupted (hospitalization) or failed. The motorcycle event is not presented as intentional self-harm. No imminent future plans are stated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post recounts **concrete, past suicidal actions** that meet the criteria for 'Attempt' (initiated, potentially lethal acts).  
   - Current hopelessness (""don't want to live"") is present but does not override the documentation of past attempts.  
   - No new plan/method/preparation for future suicide is indicated.  
   - **Rule application**: Past attempts take precedence over current ideation. Descriptions of swallowing pills/cutting/overdosing are unambiguous suicidal acts, not just thoughts or plans.

**Conclusion**: The post falls under 'Attempt' due to detailed descriptions of past, initiated, life-threatening suicidal actions.

60,"'I know I should die for the good of a lot of people. But I am a coward who could not take a few seconds of pain. As always I remain a living fat bastard unworthy of anything. Here I am yet again the same loser who would never make it out of this treacherous pit. I\'ve been trying to push myself to kill myself for the last few weeks. Tgere were moments of ups and downs. But I just cant. I chicken out like I did in almost everything in life. \n\nI\'m almost 30 years old for fuck sake. I don\'t have a job coz I am so stressed to work in the fucking accounting and auditing field I have knowledge about. I am ""trying"" to get a job for the sake of my grandma eho us worried sick of me. My parents are still trusting my sorry ass that I would find a job and get martied snd ""live happily ever after"". How can I tell them that I have let them down?\n\n The rest of my family have lost hope in me. I have had warnings and serious advices from all family members to get my act straight. I\'ve been called a laxy bum by my relatives. My brother calls me a selfish guy as I am living on other people\'s money and almost disowned me. I know he didn\'t and I wish he did. \n\nI don\'t mean to sit on my ass and play township all day eating sleeping and shitting forever. I wish I could be on my own. But the thought of life scares me. I hate the field I\'m semi qualified for. I fucked up the final exams after wasting an year including the lockdown and postponement of exams last year. I tried to find a way out of this field but all my ""unrealistic"" ideas didn\'t seem to work. I thought I could become a part time teacher as I always liked to teach. But my brother who is a very successful and know it all genius of the family pointed out that teachers are already jobless and I am a stupid idiot who would fail his students as he can\'t even get himself to pass an exam. I can\'t become a writer coz that requires some intelligence which I don\'t have. I can\'t run a business of my own as I am broke and I would fail that too. I can\'t do anything else. I am stuck and keep going down this quicksand pit. \n\nEven if I suck it up and get a job in the audit field, what am I gonna do? I would be replaced by someon who is actually resourceful in a matter of no time. Even if I become good in my job, what next? Work for 60 hours a week for the next 30 years on something that drives me crazy? Get married for the sake of family? Get a bunch of kids snd add their well being and education into the list of my ever expanding troubles? Make connections with people I don\'t like for the sake of social status? Why is that life for anyway? \n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? Everyone else seems to be enjoying this godforsaken way of life that has sslaved us to our luxuries and  social status. Why can\'t I suck it up and become a zombie and do whatever I\'m told to? Why is my brain not able to get the message? \n\nI have been noticed by teachers and friends to have signs of ADHD sibce school days. But my family who don\'t believe in mental illness knows better. They know that I\'m a lazy awkward idiot who didn\'t learn to focus his thoughts and is still immature and can\'t handle being a MAN as my brother is. \n\nI know there\'s a million quotes about ""we can live the life we want and nobody can stop us"" or ""Work hard and be successful"" shit. But whst is the point in all of that if I ultimately despise the fucking life itself?\n\nWhat is the point to anything? Am I in hell? Is this the way I get tortured for eternity? I got molested by my aunt\'s sister when I was 7 and my  brother when I was 8. Both of them were also underage during that time. So they dropped their load on me. At least I didn\'t molest anyone to satisfy my curiosity. I just learned masturbation when I was 10 and did it like 4 times a day until I turned 25. I developed a craving for pleasure even before I knew what it is. I am still suffering fighting hard to control my thoughts. \n\nI dropped out of school when I was 13 and put back in school at 19. Worked my way through without thinking about what I really want and went on with what my family thought would be good for my future. Well that\'s what you get being born in a dysfunctional family and having mental illness. I am suffering from depression and anxiety for the last 6 years. Well everyone else thinks that I\'m lazy and moody. Maybe that is what i am. \n\nI am a useless piece of garbage. No even garbage can be recycled or turned into manure or something. I am just a waste of a life being a burden on everyone adding carbon dioxide to the earth. \n\nI have tried several times to take myself out the last few weeks. Hanging myself, drowning myself, falling from the 3rd floor on to the road below, hanging again. But. i just can\'t go through it. I can\'t live, I can\'t die. Story of my life is nothing but waste of time and resources. \n\nI wish I could just go through it. A few seconds of pain is enough. I would dir and the world would be a better place.\n\nFor fuck sake give me a heart attack or something. Haven\'t I had enough? What more fucked up shit is shead for me?\n\nHindu mythology says hell is filled with torture methods like boiling pas of oil and fire to torture the bad people. I used to believe that.

But people like me can't relate to anything else this much. \n\nI have seen here posts about many people suffering and wanting to end their painful existence.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains explicit mentions of suicide methods (""hanging myself, drowning myself, falling from the 3rd floor"") and repeated references to recent actions taken (""I have tried several times to take myself out the last few weeks""). The author expresses intense hopelessness, self-loathing, and a persistent desire to die (""I wish I could just go through it... I would die""). Critically, they describe initiating concrete suicidal actions that were interrupted by their inability to follow through (""I just can’t go through it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. Phrases like ""take myself out,"" ""kill myself,"" ""I would die,"" and ""I wish I never existed"" show a clear, personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. Specific methods (hanging, drowning, jumping from height) are explicitly stated. However, the defining factor is not just the plan/method but the described **initiation of action**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The author describes **past/recent concrete actions** that were initiated but not completed: ""I have tried several times... Hanging myself, drowning myself, falling... But I just can’t go through it."" These are self-initiated, potentially lethal acts that were stopped by the author (""I chicken out""), meeting the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The presence of initiated, potentially lethal actions (even if aborted) takes precedence over current ideation/behavior. The core distinction is between *thinking* about methods (Behavior) and *acting* on them (Attempt). Here, the author repeatedly attempted methods but stopped midway. This fits 'Attempt' under the definition: ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions... that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self or others, or ultimately failed.""

61,"'i hope a meteor hits and destroys the whole earth and kill us all. at this point u might think, tf is wrong with me but yeah i really hope it happens i hate every human being especially my family for forcing me to live'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses intense distress, anger, and hopelessness (""i hate every human being especially my family for forcing me to live""). It includes a wish for mass destruction (""i hope a meteor hits and destroys the whole earth and kill us all""), which implies a desire for death but in a passive, externalized way (i.e., not self-initiated).
   - There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means related to the author acting on themselves. The death wish is tied to an uncontrollable event (meteor), not personal action.
   - No evidence of plans, preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or past suicidal actions.
   - The temporal context is general and hypothetical (""i hope it happens""), with no imminence or timeframe for action.
   - The author's desire is framed as a reaction to being ""forced to live,"" indicating distress and a lack of desire for life, but not an explicit personal intent to die by suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct personal expressions of a desire to die by one's own hand. The wish for death is external (meteor) and collective (""kill us all"").
   - While the author expresses unhappiness with life and resentment about being forced to live, this does not translate to a clear, current desire for self-inflicted death. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, and any implied death wish is negated by the external context.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The meteor is not a feasible or personal method; it is entirely hypothetical and outside the author's control.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and a hypothetical future event, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions initiated by the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire or intent. The death wish is passive and external, falling under abstract dissatisfaction with life.
   - No explicit suicidal ideation, plan, or behavior is present. Ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire leans toward 'Indicator' per the rules.
   - Rules emphasize that if suicidal desire is not personally expressed or is negated/unwanted, it should be 'Indicator'. Here, the author's focus is on external forces and anger, not self-harm.
   - Not 'Ideation' because there is no direct statement of wanting to die by suicide (e.g., ""I want to die"" is absent). Not 'Behavior' due to no plan/method. Not 'Attempt' as no action was taken.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses frustration with life circumstances (living with parents at 29) and intense anger or distress (evident from the repeated ""fuck"" and random keyboard characters). It ends with a specific dislike for coding.
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods/means.
   - Emotional indicators include frustration and possible hopelessness about life situation, but no explicit despair, anhedonia, or feeling like a burden in a suicidal context.
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, past actions, or imminence related to suicide.
   - The writer's stated desire is focused on dissatisfaction (e.g., hating coding), not a wish to die or suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""want to die"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not present, so no need to assess if they are unwanted.
   - Leans towards 'Indicator' due to absence of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.
   - Confirms no basis for 'Behavior' or higher categories.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No description of past, current, or future suicidal actions or intentions.
   - No evidence of initiated actions, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress (frustration, anger) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action.
   - Fits 'Indicator' as it involves abstract dissatisfaction without suicidal ideation. If there were ambiguity, 'Indicator' would be chosen over 'Ideation', but here no ambiguity exists.
   - Rules applied: Focus on the author only; no suicide risk elements present.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, feelings of being mistreated (""mocked,"" ""abused""), hopelessness (""if I leave them I have no one""), and despair.  
   - Mentions feeling like a burden (""he would be better off without me"") and frustration with interpersonal conflicts.  
   - **No explicit references to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.**  
   - The phrase ""I want it to stop"" refers to criticism/abuse, not life itself. ""Better off without me"" suggests passive burdensomeness but lacks a direct wish to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or a desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned**, unwanted or otherwise.  
   - ""Better off without me"" implies self-deprecation but **not a stated desire to end life**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No references to plans, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on **past/ongoing emotional abuse** (by Z, family) and distress.  
   - **No description** of past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is **distress, hopelessness, and feeling trapped**, but **without explicit personal desire to die, suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt**.  
   - Key phrases (""better off without me,"" ""want it to stop"") reflect despair but **not suicidal intent**.  
   - **Falls under 'Indicator'**: Expresses risk factors (burdensomeness, isolation, abuse) but lacks current/personal suicidal desire, plan, or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""I was already suicidal"" indicating past and ongoing suicidal thoughts. It expresses intense emotional distress with phrases like ""I feel so bad,"" ""terrible terrible,"" ""incredibly overwhelmed,"" and ""don't know what to do."" There is a specific reference to self-harm/suicide: ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat,"" which implies a lethal method (throat-cutting). No preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) or past actions (e.g., initiating self-harm) are described. The temporal context is current (""late in the evening,"" ""feel so bad"" now), with no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") stated. The desire is expressed as a current urge to act to stop thoughts, but it is not framed as unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" in a personal context (""I was already suicidal"") and expresses a clear desire to engage in a lethal act (""cutting my god damn throat"") to end distress, implying a wish to die. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not intend to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""cutting my god damn throat."" This is a concrete, potentially lethal means. However, there is no indication of a detailed plan (e.g., when, where), preparations (e.g., obtaining a tool), or imminent action—only a stated desire (""all I want to do"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and urges, with a reference to past suicidal ideation (""was already suicidal"") but no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., attempting throat-cutting). Thus, there is no evidence of a concrete, potentially lethal action that was carried out.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to explicit personal suicidal desire and a specific method mentioned, ruling out Indicator.
   - It includes suicidal thoughts with a method (throat-cutting), which exceeds Ideation (defined as desire without plan/method). Mentioning a method, even briefly, aligns with Behavior.
   - There is no description of an initiated action, so Attempt does not apply.
   - Therefore, the presence of a specific method in the context of suicidal desire qualifies this as Behavior, per the definition: ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions... a specific method.""

65,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""plotting my suicide,"" ""drafted my will,"" specific considerations (methods ruled out like household weapons, ensuring only trained personnel find them).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""can't click into life""), shame/guilt about suicidal thoughts, feeling ""wired different,"" exhaustion (""I am just tired"").  
   - Preparations: Drafting a will (concrete action), ongoing plotting ""on and off for months,"" method logistics (avoiding weapons, discovery plans).  
   - Desire clarity: Expresses unwanted obligation (""suicide pact feels like an obligation"") but also states, ""I don't think I would do 'it'.""  
   - Imminence: No immediate timeline (feels ""better today,"" ""out of my hole for now"").  
   - Past actions: Drafting a will (preparation), no described initiated lethal acts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""plotting my suicide"" and references a ""suicide pact."" Desire is personal but conflicted (""I don't think I would do it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific preparations (drafted a will) and method considerations (excluding household weapons, planning discovery logistics).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing plotting and recent preparation (drafting the will). No initiated lethal act (e.g., no pills taken, no attempt interrupted).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal planning are present.  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (only preparation).  
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: Specific preparations (will) and method logistics elevate this beyond mere thoughts.  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + concrete plan/preparation (will drafting, method exclusion, discovery logistics) fits the definition.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses exhaustion, hopelessness, and despair about life circumstances (e.g., ""i'm always tired,"" ""life is so cyclic,"" ""no motivation""). It mentions feeling ill, pushing people away, financial struggles, loneliness, and jealousy. The phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" is ambiguous but could imply a desire to end suffering. No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. References to ""pills"" are in the context of medical treatment (""none of the pills do enough""), not as a suicide method. No specific plans, methods, locations, or preparations for suicide are described. No past suicidal actions are mentioned. Emotional indicators are strong (hopelessness, despair, isolation), but the desire to die is not clearly stated. The temporal context (""soon"") suggests imminence, but it's vague and not tied to a suicidal act. The writer's stated desire focuses on distress about life, not an explicit wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases. No clear expression of a desire to die (e.g., phrases like ""I want to die"" are absent). The closest statement (""i'm ready to get this over with"") is open to interpretation but lacks direct suicidal intent. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there's no discussion of them being unwanted. Overall, the primary sentiment is distress about life circumstances, not a personal desire for death. Leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills for overdose, weapons) or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The ""pills"" referenced are for illness treatment, not suicide. No plan is indicated. Without any clear plan or method, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional distress and future intentions (""soon"") but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions. References to past events (e.g., getting fast food on Thanksgiving) are not related to self-harm or suicide attempts. No concrete, potentially lethal actions are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows significant distress and hopelessness but lacks an explicit, personal expression of suicidal desire. The ambiguous phrase ""get this over with"" could be interpreted as suicidal ideation, but due to the absence of clear suicidal intent and the rule to choose 'Indicator' in cases of ambiguity, it fits 'Indicator'. There is no plan/method for 'Behavior' and no past action for 'Attempt'. The content aligns with 'Indicator' as it expresses general dissatisfaction with life and emotional turmoil without confirming a current desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""I don't see a future for me anymore""), isolation (""alone with nobody""), and despair (""tired of living so unhappy"").  
   - Explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts: ""I always think about suicide all the time"" and ""i always think about ending it.""  
   - No specific suicide method, plan, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described.  
   - No mention of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  
   - The desire to die is personal and current (e.g., ""I don't see a future,"" ""tired of living""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""think about suicide"" and ""ending it"" indicate a personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., ""bought a rope,"" ""wrote a note"") are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing suicidal thoughts (""all the time,"" ""since I was 9"") but **no concrete past/recent actions** initiated (e.g., no ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit and personal, ruling out *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of any plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past/recent lethal actions rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""think about ending it"") without plans/methods.

We start dying the second we are born. This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good. So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense anger, hopelessness (""miserable lives,"" ""rotting away""), and existential despair (""human life has no fucking purpose"").  
   - Explicit future suicidal intent: ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good.""  
   - Specific temporal marker (""in April"") and implied preparation (""taking a trip"") suggest a plan.  
   - No mention of past actions or attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""End this bullshit for good"" strongly implies a desire to die (not abstract distress).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Taking a trip in April to end this"" implies a planned action (method/location implied via ""trip"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes a **future intention** (April timeline). No past/initiated actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/timeline (""trip in April"") = **Behavior**.  
   - No initiated lethal action (rules out 'Attempt').

69,"Anyone agree?. I hate how my ex-friend who bullied me into nearly killing myself/shooting up the school is just gonna live this ✨MagIcAl✨ life and I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away. I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions past suicidal thoughts/actions (""bullied me into nearly killing myself/shooting up the school""), which implies a specific method (shooting) and that an action was nearly taken. It also expresses current emotional distress (""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away,"" ""I fucking hate living"") and hopelessness (""Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?""). The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" suggests a past event where suicidal action was initiated or seriously contemplated but not completed. No current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned; the focus is on past events and current feelings of despair.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" indicating direct suicidal intent in the past context. For the present, ""I fucking hate living"" expresses a desire not to be alive but is less explicit about current suicidal intent; it primarily conveys distress. The past suicidal thought (""nearly killing myself"") is not framed as unwanted in the present; it's part of a narrative about being bullied.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (""shooting up the school"") is mentioned, but only in the past context of being bullied into it. There is no indication of current planning, preparation, or method for suicide. The post focuses on past events and current emotional pain without detailing any imminent plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: ""nearly killing myself"" implies a concrete, potentially lethal action that was initiated but not completed (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed). This aligns with the Attempt definition, as it references a self-initiated, life-threatening action. The current expressions (""I fucking hate living"") indicate ongoing distress and possible ideation, but the past attempt takes precedence per the rules.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The mention of a past suicidal action (""nearly killing myself"") with a specific method (""shooting up the school"") qualifies as an Attempt, as it describes an initiated, potentially lethal event. Current expressions like ""I fucking hate living"" suggest suicidal ideation but lack a plan or preparation, which would otherwise lean toward Ideation. However, because a past attempt is clearly referenced, Attempt is the appropriate category per the precedence rule. The emotional distress and hopelessness support the context but do not override the historical action.

70,"I'm trying my best to be happy but something inside of me is telling me to die. Fuck you depression. Can anyone talk to me now. I can't take it anymore, I've been through too much. Please just let me rest eternally. I want to be a boy and the fact that people see me as a female makes me want to die. I hate living within these rigid gender expectations and having women call me girl. It is extremely triggering for me. I hate how my dad always mentions getting married and having children but honestly I fucking hate children and I would never give birth to one. I hate wearing feminine clothing and tight clothes and clothes that show off my legs in general. I want to wear suits and jackets and long clothes in general.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""I can't take it anymore,"" ""I want to give up""), and explicit suicidal desire (""I want to die,"" ""Please just let me rest eternally"").  
   - **Crucially**, it includes a specific method inquiry: ""Is hanging 100% effective. As in if I try hard enough, I can die."" This directly references hanging as a suicide method and questions its lethality.  
   - No past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried hanging"") are described. Self-harm mentions (screaming to hurt vocal cords) are non-lethal expressions of distress.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Multiple explicit statements: ""I want to die,"" ""let me rest eternally,"" and linking gender dysphoria to ""makes me want to die."" No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. The phrase ""Is hanging 100% effective"" introduces a specific method (hanging) and evaluates its feasibility for suicide. This constitutes planning behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intent (""I want to die,"" questioning hanging’s effectiveness). No description of past suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried hanging"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Behavior**: Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** threshold crossed) + specific method (hanging) mentioned. The query about hanging’s effectiveness indicates active consideration of the method, aligning with **Behavior**. No concrete past action (**Attempt**) is described.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Unambiguous personal desire to die.  
   - *Not Attempt*: No initiated lethal action (only hypothetical/method inquiry).

71,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions a specific method: ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" (jumping from height).  
   - Expresses temptation to act (""so tempted""), ambivalence (""if only such decisions were simple""), and emotional conflict (guilt, fear of consequences for others or surviving injured).  
   - No reference to past actions, preparations (e.g., being at the location), or imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). Focuses on hypothetical contemplation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""Plummet to the ground"" implies a lethal fall, and ""crippled instead of a corpse"" explicitly contrasts outcomes of death vs. injury, confirming suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. A specific method (jumping from a high floor) is clearly stated. No preparations (e.g., ""going there now"") are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a current temptation but no past or recent initiated action. The phrasing (""tempted to,"" ""if only"") indicates contemplation, not execution.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die and specific method (jumping) place this beyond *Indicator* (no clear desire) or *Ideation* (no plan/method).  
   - Lacks any description of an initiated action (e.g., ""I went to the roof but stopped""), so not *Attempt*.  
   - Fits *Behavior*: suicidal desire + specific method mentioned.

72,Can someone just hug me please. I just want the pain to go away,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses a plea for comfort (""Can someone just hug me please"") and a desire for relief from emotional pain (""I just want the pain to go away"").  
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations.  
   - Emotional indicators include distress and suffering (e.g., ""pain""), but no explicit hopelessness, despair, or references to being a burden.  
   - No stated desire to die, no plans, methods, or past actions related to suicide.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or death.  
   - **No clear desire to die** expressed; the focus is on alleviating pain, not ending life.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No plan, method, tools, or preparations** mentioned or implied.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current emotional distress** only. No past actions, attempts, or imminent intentions related to self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post reflects **general distress and a cry for support** but lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, or actions.  
   - Falls under **'Indicator'** due to the absence of suicidal intent, ideation, or behavior, despite clear emotional pain.

73,Screw this. The more I live the more I want to die. Can't be fucked with anything anymore,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The key elements include: 
     - Explicit mention of a desire to die: ""the more I want to die.""
     - Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair: ""Can't be fucked with anything anymore"" suggests anhedonia (loss of interest) and general distress.
     - No mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or past actions.
     - No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the statement is general and ongoing.
     - The desire to die is stated directly and not negated or framed as unwanted; it reflects a genuine wish.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The phrase ""I want to die"" is an explicit personal expression of a desire not to be alive, falling under suicidal ideation. It is not abstract or unwanted (e.g., no language like ""but I don't want to act on it""). Thus, this is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun), or preparations are mentioned. The post focuses solely on the desire to die without actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current, ongoing state (""the more I live"") with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions. It expresses thoughts, not behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") qualifies for 'Ideation', as there is no plan, method, or preparation. The hopelessness reinforces distress but does not elevate it to 'Behavior' without a concrete plan. 'Attempt' is ruled out due to no described actions. 'Indicator' is inappropriate because the desire is personal and explicit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide, death, and self-harm (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""i want to die,"" ""end it all,"" ""slice my wrists,"" ""overdose""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""it wont get better,"" ""im never getting out of here""), despair (""im so tired""), and feelings of being a burden (e.g., references to parents' reactions). Specific methods are detailed, including overdose (""down all my paracetamol, xanax, and effexor""), cutting (""slice my wrists open""), and throwing into traffic. Preparations are mentioned, such as having pills saved up (""way more than lethal dosage"") and plans to give away a game account. Imminence is highlighted with ""tonight"" and a future deadline tied to a game event. The writer expresses a strong desire to die but also mentions fear as a barrier to acting. Past actions include cutting (""i tried cutting myself"") that was not completed due to fear, and a history of suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and similar phrases multiple times. It expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""i just want to die,"" ""i dont want to be alive anymore""). The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, the writer wants to act but is hesitant due to fear (e.g., ""i want to but im too scared""). This indicates genuine suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, specific methods are described: overdose (with paracetamol, xanax, effexor), cutting, and traffic. Preparations are evident: pills are saved and at hand (""i have all the pills""), and there is a plan to give away possessions (game account). A temporal plan is specified for imminent action (""tonight"") and a future trigger (after getting a game character). This presence of plan, method, and preparation shifts the classification toward 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes past actions (e.g., cutting that was initiated but not completed) and current/future intentions (e.g., plans for ""tonight"" and after the game event). The past cutting is described as an initiated action (""i tried cutting myself""), but it was not potentially lethal due to fear (""too scared to cut down deep enough""), and it is not the focus of the current risk. The primary concern is the imminent plan (""tonight"") with a specific method and means, which has not yet been initiated. This aligns with 'Behavior' for the current/future plan, rather than 'Attempt' for past actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts (ruling out 'Indicator') and includes explicit desire to die (ruling out 'Ideation' alone). The mention of specific plans (e.g., overdose ""tonight""), methods (pills, cutting), and preparations (pills saved, account giveaway) fits 'Behavior'. The past cutting does not qualify as a clear 'Attempt' because it was not described as a potentially lethal action that was completed or resulted in risk (e.g., it was superficial and aborted). Since the current content emphasizes imminent plans with means, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category.

75,It will all be done after I die. I want to die because I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color I'm just going to pull the trigger if a cop doesn't do it first.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of death/dying (""It will all be done after I die,"" ""I want to die"") and a specific suicidal method (""pull the trigger,"" referring to using a firearm). Emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair are present due to pressure related to skin color. The phrase ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" indicates a personal plan for future action, with no reference to past actions or preparations. The statement ""if a cop doesn't do it first"" adds context but does not negate the author's own suicidal intent. The desire to die is clear and personal, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" (which implies suicide). There is no negation of this desire; it is presented as genuine and personal.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""pull the trigger"" clearly refers to using a firearm as a means of suicide. There are no explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note), but the mention of a method is sufficient to lean toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm just going to pull the trigger""), not a past or recent action. No initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I want to die""), ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires no explicit suicidal intent).
   - It includes a specific method (""pull the trigger""), which elevates it beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan or method).
   - With no evidence of past or recent initiated actions, 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - The mention of a method (firearm) fits 'Behavior', as it indicates planning, even if briefly stated. There is no uncertainty about the method being explicit.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

   - The temporal context is future-oriented (""going to,"" ""matter of when"") with no reference to past actions or attempts.  
   - The desire to die is explicitly stated and not framed as unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""I'm going to kill myself"" is a direct, personal declaration of suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**: ""Only a matter of when"" confirms a current desire to die without ambiguity.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While timing (""when"") is implied vaguely, no specific method, tools, location, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intention (""going to"") but **no past or recent initiated lethal action** (e.g., no reference to trying a method).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") is present, but the absence of any plan/method/preparation rules out ""Behavior."" No past action indicates ""Attempt"" is inapplicable. The clear suicidal intent distinguishes this from ""Indicator.""

77,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol'You're here because of something.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post lists specific substances and quantities: ""Midol 3 bottles,"" ""Prozac 30 20mg pills,"" ""Tylenol bottle,"" and ""Water bottle full of alcohol,"" which are potential means for a lethal overdose.
   - It directly asks, ""Would this kill me?"" indicating a personal consideration of death or suicide using these items.
   - There are no explicit emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair) or references to past actions, but the focus is on the lethality of a combination of substances.
   - The phrase ""You're here because of something"" is ambiguous but may imply a context of preparation or intent, though it's not clearly explanatory.
   - The temporal context is prospective (considering a future action), with no indication of imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") or any initiated action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or directly state a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). Instead, it poses a question about lethality.
   - The question ""Would this kill me?"" implies contemplation of death but is not an explicit expression of a wish to die. There is no negation or statement that these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don't want to"").
   - This leans away from 'Indicator' due to the personal and specific nature of the query, but the lack of explicit desire means it doesn't fully meet 'Ideation' on intent alone.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is clearly mentioned: combining multiple medications (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol) with alcohol for potential overdose. Quantities (e.g., ""3 bottles,"" ""30 20mg pills"") suggest access to means and detailed planning.
   - The listing of items could imply preparation (e.g., having the substances ready), though there's no explicit statement of actions like writing a note or saying goodbye.
   - The presence of a specific method shifts this toward 'Behavior', as it goes beyond general thoughts of death to include actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I took"" or ""I tried""). It is entirely future-oriented, asking about a hypothetical outcome.
   - Without any description of an initiated, potentially lethal act, this does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal consideration of suicide through the question about lethality and the specific method described. However, the desire to die is not directly stated, only implied.
   - The detailed mention of substances and quantities constitutes a plan/method, which aligns with 'Behavior' (defined as expressions of suicidal thoughts with a plan, method, or preparation).
   - It is not 'Indicator' because it is not abstract or general distress; it involves a personal, concrete method. It is not 'Ideation' because a method is specified. It is not 'Attempt' because no action was taken.
   - Following the rule: ""If a plan/method is present, consider 'Behavior'."" Also, ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Here, the method is explicit (specific substances and amounts), so 'Behavior' is appropriate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains multiple expressions of intense despair and suicidal thoughts:
    - Explicit phrases: ""be better off dead,"" ""just want it over,"" ""only way now is well. the obvious,"" ""it's something I have to do,"" ""I can't live like this anymore.""
    - Mentions specific methods: ""find the tallest thing and jump,"" ""run in front of a train,"" and references having pills (""Got pills to take if it gets too much... Or it's curtains for this one!"").
    - Notes preparation/access to means: ""Got pills to take"" implies possession of a potential method.
    - Expresses current desire to die with urgency: ""its going to have to happen soon,"" ""I don't want to [live].""
    - No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct statements include ""be better off dead,"" ""only way now is well. the obvious,"" and ""it's something I have to do."" The desire to die is personal and current.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Specific methods (jumping, trains) are mentioned, and pills are explicitly referenced as an available means (""Got pills to take if it gets too much""). This shows preparation/planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past/recent initiated lethal actions described. References to past thoughts (""I thought I would end it a while ago"") lack concrete action and are framed as ideation. Current focus is on future intent (""its going to have to happen soon"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong suicidal desire (rules out *Indicator*).  
   - Specific methods (jumping, trains) and possession of means (pills) confirm a plan/preparation (rules out *Ideation*).  
   - No initiated action described (rules out *Attempt*).  
   - Falls under *Behavior*: desire to die **plus** explicit mention of methods/means.

79,"I'm still here and I made the decision to live. Life will be challenging going forward, but I'll make it work. I've posted here so many times about how I set a date and then… I keep living past that date. Now my situation is no longer as desperate as it once was. It was extraordinarily painful, but what was hurting me is about to end. The light at the end of the tunnel is almost here. I came extraordinarily close to killing myself. As in, my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses a past state where the author had a set suicide plan (""set a date,"" ""letters were written,"" ""had a set plan""), was very close to acting (""days away from going through with""), and explicitly mentions being ""extraordinarily close to killing myself."" However, the current context is one of recovery: the author states they ""made the decision to live,"" their situation is improving, and they express hope (""light at the end of the tunnel""). There are no current expressions of suicidal desire, plan, or imminent risk.
   - Emotional indicators: Past despair is implied by the closeness to suicide, but current emotions are hopeful and resolved.
   - Plan/method/preparation: Explicitly mentioned in the past tense: ""letters were written"" (preparation) and ""had a set plan"" (method implied, though not specified).
   - References to past actions: Describes preparations (writing letters) and planning (setting dates), but no indication of an initiated lethal action (e.g., no mention of actually attempting the plan, like taking pills or jumping). The author notes they ""keep living past that date,"" confirming no action was taken.
   - Imminence: Past imminence (""days away"") is stated, but not current.
   - Stated desire: Past desire to die is clear (""close to killing myself""), but current desire is explicitly negated (""made the decision to live"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and implies a past desire to die through phrases like ""close to killing myself.""
   - However, the desire is framed in the past tense and is currently rejected (""I made the decision to live""), so there is no current personal expression of a wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, specific preparations are mentioned (""letters were written"") and a ""set plan"" is referenced, indicating past suicidal behavior. No method is detailed, but the plan is explicit.
   - Since this is in the past and no current plan is expressed, it pertains to historical behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past events: historical suicidal thoughts, planning, and preparations, but no initiated lethal action (e.g., ""was days away from going through with"" indicates intent but not initiation). The author survived past set dates, emphasizing no action was taken.
   - No current or future suicidal intentions are expressed; instead, the focus is on recovery.
   - Past actions include preparations (writing letters) but not a concrete, potentially lethal act. For example, there is no description of starting an overdose or other method.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author's current state lacks suicidal desire, so it is not 'Ideation' or 'Behavior' for the present.
   - Past expressions include explicit suicidal thoughts, a plan, and preparations, fitting 'Behavior' (defined as mentioning a plan/method/preparations alongside desire, even if brief or historical).
   - It does not qualify as 'Attempt' because no initiated lethal action is described (e.g., no ""tried to"" or action taken; preparations alone are insufficient for 'Attempt').
   - 'Indicator' is inappropriate because the post explicitly describes personal past suicidal desire with a plan, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - Since the plan and preparations are mentioned, and no ambiguity exists about past suicidal behavior, 'Behavior' is the best fit based on the historical context described.

80,I'm truly running on nothing but shear spite at this point. I really want to check out. I can not really express how much I want to check out at this point. The only thing that seems to be holding me here at this point is shear spite. It is not that I have any moral problem with suicide at this point or even care about what me unexpectedly checking out would do to the other in my life but it just seems like such a waste to go out this way when I have held on for so long but I have come to realize recently that even spite has its limits.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: The post expresses a strong desire to ""check out"" (a common euphemism for suicide/death), repeated twice for emphasis. The author explicitly states they have no moral objection to suicide and are unconcerned about the impact on others. The primary deterrent is ""sheer spite,"" but they acknowledge this motivation is waning (""even spite has its limits"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""running on nothing""), despair, and anhedonia (lack of other sustaining motivations).  
   - No mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""I really want to check out"" is a clear euphemism for suicidal desire, reinforced by contextual despair and the dismissal of moral/social barriers. The desire is personal and current, not negated as unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No. There is no reference to methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or timelines.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past or recent actions described. The focus is entirely on current desire and internal conflict.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a **personal, explicit desire to die** (""I want to check out"") but lacks any plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with **Ideation**.  
   - *Not Indicator*: The desire to die is explicit and personal, not abstract or unwanted.  
   - *Not Behavior/Attempt*: No plan, method, preparation, or past/current action is mentioned.

I refuse to and my resolve not to is winning currently but honestly what the fuck. This shit comes out of nowhere. "", 'I can still win my mental health battles but I am definitely losing the war. and it is slowly destroying me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions a specific method: ""slit my wrists,"" which is a direct reference to self-harm with suicidal potential.
   - Emotional indicators include distress (""extreme impulse,"" ""it has been going on all night,"" ""what the fuck,"" ""this shit comes out of nowhere"") and hopelessness (""I am definitely losing the war,"" ""it is slowly destroying me"").
   - There is no mention of specific plans, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no reference to having a knife, writing a note, or choosing a time/place). The method is part of an impulse, not an articulated plan.
   - The writer explicitly states resistance to acting on the impulse: ""I refuse to and my resolve not to is winning currently."" This indicates the thoughts are unwanted and not desired.
   - No past or recent actions are described; the focus is on current impulses and mental struggle. The temporal context is immediate but not imminent for action due to active resistance.
   - The writer's desire is conflicted: the impulse to self-harm is present, but it is framed as unwanted and actively resisted, with no expressed wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""slit my wrists"" implies a method associated with suicidal intent.
   - However, the writer negates any desire to act: ""I refuse to"" and ""my resolve not to is winning."" This shows the suicidal thoughts are explicitly unwanted and not representative of a current personal desire to die. Therefore, this leans toward 'Indicator' as per the thinking process.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (""slit my wrists"") is mentioned, which could suggest 'Behavior.' However, it is described only as an impulse in the context of being resisted, not as part of a plan or preparation. There is no evidence of planning (e.g., acquiring means or setting a timeline). Given the uncertainty and the lack of explicit planning elements, 'Ideation' should be considered over 'Behavior' as per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current impulse but no past or recent actions. The impulse is ongoing (""all night"") but resisted, so no initiated lethal action occurred. This rules out 'Attempt.'

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key distinction is between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation.' The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""impulse to slit my wrists"") but explicitly states these are unwanted and resisted, indicating distress rather than a genuine desire to die. The primary sentiment is about battling unwanted impulses, not endorsing them. According to the 'Indicator' definition, this fits because it involves ""mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted."" Additionally, the thinking process advises choosing 'Indicator' over 'Ideation' when there is ambiguity about suicidal desire, as here. Mention of a method alone does not elevate it to 'Behavior' because there is no plan or preparation, and the impulse is being actively opposed. 'Attempt' is not applicable due to the absence of action.

Final classification reasoning: The post shows high distress and unwanted suicidal impulses but no desire, plan, or action, aligning best with 'Indicator.'

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""I've got nothing left,"" ""I'm completely used up""), despair, and feelings of being a burden (""I'm sorry I wasn't a better person""). It includes farewell messages (""Love you Mom, Dad..."", ""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt"", ""thank you to those who brought any light""), which may resemble a goodbye note. The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" suggests a desire for an end to suffering, possibly implying death or suicide. However, there are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die""). No specific methods, plans, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note beyond this post) are indicated. No references to past actions, attempts, or imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") are present. The emotional tone is one of deep distress and resignation, but the suicidal desire is implied rather than stated outright.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" expresses a desire for an end, which could be interpreted as a wish to die, but it is not unambiguous (e.g., it could refer to an end to emotional pain without death). The writer does not explicitly state a genuine wish to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or equivalent), nor do they negate or express unwanted suicidal thoughts. Due to the lack of explicit personal desire for death, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""got the pills"") are mentioned. The farewells could be seen as implicit preparation, but they are not described as part of a suicide plan. Without any explicit plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings (e.g., ""feels right now"") with no reference to past or recent actions. No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post indicates severe distress and hopelessness but lacks an explicit, personal expression of a desire to die or commit suicide (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die""). While the farewells and mention of ""the end"" suggest suicidal ideation, they are ambiguous and not direct enough for 'Ideation' per the definitions. The rules state: ""If no desire to die or commit suicide is personally expressed by the author for themselves, consider 'Indicator'"" and ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" There is no plan, method, or preparation for 'Behavior', and no past action for 'Attempt'. Thus, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category, as the primary content reflects general distress and abstract references to an end, without clear suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""attempting"" (referring to suicide) and ""finally going. Progressing."" as explicit expressions of intent to act.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I've tried absolutely everything""), numbness, feeling like a burden (""barely serve a purpose""), and isolation (""couldn't care"" about people around).
   - Specific plans/methods: None explicitly stated (e.g., no tools, locations, substances, or preparations like notes). References ""planning it out"" but lacks concrete details.
   - Past actions: Only describes ""severe passive suicidal thoughts"" historically, no initiated lethal actions. Current state involves ""wanting to plan"" but no execution.
   - Imminence: Conditional on therapy failing (""if it doesn't succeed""), not immediate.
   - Desire: Explicitly states progression from passive thoughts to active desire (""wanting to plan it out and go through with it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Uses ""attempting"" (clearly shorthand for suicide) and ""finally going. Progressing."" (indicating intent to die).
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act""). Distress is present, but the desire is affirmed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Mentions ""planning it out"" but no specifics (method, tools, location, or preparations). General intent without actionable steps.
   - Rules state: If unsure about explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Focuses on future conditional intent (""if therapy doesn’t work"").
   - No past or recent initiated lethal actions described (only passive thoughts historically).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die and suicidal intent place it beyond 'Indicator'.
   - Lack of concrete plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
   - No initiated lethal action (past or recent) rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Core elements align with 'Ideation': Personal desire to die and intent to act, but no specific plan or method detailed.

When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy.

Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""serious thoughts about suicide for days,"" ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself,"" and ""triggers me to actually want to commit suicide."" 
   - Emotional indicators include anger, frustration, hopelessness, and self-doubt (""Am I faking my depression?""). 
   - References researching specific methods (""easy painless ways to kill myself"") but no explicit preparation (e.g., acquiring means, setting a date) or concrete plan. 
   - No past suicidal actions described (e.g., ""I tried to...""). 
   - Temporal context: Ongoing ideation (""thoughts for days"") triggered by family conflicts, but no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""thoughts about suicide,"" ""want to commit suicide,"" and ""kill myself."" The author personally expresses a desire to die, not merely unwanted thoughts (e.g., no negation like ""but I don’t want to act"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Method mentioned**: Researching ""easy painless ways to kill myself."" This implies exploration of methods but lacks specificity (e.g., no named tool/location) or explicit preparation.  
   - **No preparation** (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  
   - Falls under 'Behavior' due to method research, but ambiguity exists (no concrete plan).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes recurring suicidal thoughts and method research but **no past/ongoing concrete actions** (e.g., no ""I took pills"" or ""I tried to jump"").  
   - Focus is on ideation and triggers, not initiated lethal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""want to commit suicide"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Method research (""research for easy painless ways"") indicates planning, leaning toward 'Behavior'. However, ambiguity exists (no *specific* method/preparation), so 'Ideation' is safer per rules (""If unsure, choose 'Ideation'"").  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No past/recent initiated lethal action (e.g., overdose), so 'Attempt' is inapplicable.  
   - **Final Decision**: Despite method research, the lack of specificity/preparation and rule emphasis on choosing 'Ideation' when uncertain tips the classification to **Ideation**.

85,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions past depression, suicidal thoughts, and a past suicide attempt (many years ago). 
   - Expresses current distress: feeling ""pushed back down,"" resurfacing suicidal thoughts, guilt about seeking help, and chronic pain. 
   - Notes a desire for help (set up appointments) and support from wife/friend. 
   - **No explicit current desire to die, plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent.** The suicidal thoughts are framed as recurring symptoms, not active intent.  
   - Focuses on guilt (""feel like a piece of crap"") and relational conflict, not suicidal action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit current desire to die or act on suicidal thoughts.** Mentions past thoughts/attempts but emphasizes seeking help (""I am going to try"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are described as unwanted/recurring (""I believed I was past it all... but this year pushed me back"").  
   - Leans toward **Indicator** due to distress about thoughts without current desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **None mentioned for current state.** Past attempt is historical (not current behavior).  
   - No tools, locations, or preparations discussed for imminent action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Past attempt explicitly stated (""many years ago"").  
   - **No recent or initiated lethal action described.** Focus is on emotional struggle and help-seeking.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Indicator**: Primary focus is distress about recurring thoughts (explicitly unwanted) and guilt over help-seeking. No current desire, plan, or preparation for suicide. The past attempt is contextual but doesn’t override the current lack of intent/plan.  
   - *Not Ideation*: No active wish to die now; thoughts are framed as symptoms.  
   - *Not Behavior/Attempt*: No plan, method, or recent/ongoing suicidal action.

86,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post is a warning about the dangers of overdosing as a suicide method. Key elements include:
   - Detailed description of the physical effects of overdose (vomiting, liver damage, prolonged suffering).
   - Mentions ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" and ""end it with pills"" in a general/educational context.
   - Explicitly discourages pill-based suicide (""Don't take the pills"").
   - No personal expression of suicidal desire, plans, or experiences by the author. The focus is on advising *others* about risks.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The author does **not** express a personal desire to die or suicidal thoughts. Phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I plan to overdose"" are absent. All references to suicide are impersonal or directed at others (""*you* could ever do,"" ""*you'll* feel fine"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - While methods (overdosing) are discussed, these are not tied to the author's personal actions or plans. The post educates about consequences without indicating the author has considered/prepared for self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions by the author. The post focuses on hypothetical scenarios for ""you"" (general audience), not the author's experiences.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author discusses suicide abstractly to warn others, expressing concern about overdose risks.
   - **No personal desire to die, suicidal ideation, plan, or past attempt is expressed by the author**. The content aligns with general distress about suicide (as a societal issue) and harm reduction advice.
   - Meets 'Indicator' criteria: impersonal discussion of suicide with no current personal intent or desire.

I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am.

But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic""No one will care when I'm gone.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: feelings of weakness, embarrassment, being used, and worthlessness (""I'm pathetic"").  
   - Mentions interpersonal conflict (toxic friend, ex) and hopelessness about resolution (""I know it's never gonna happen"").  
   - **Key phrase:** ""No one will care when I'm gone."" This implies a passive acceptance of death/absence but lacks explicit suicidal desire.  
   - No mentions of suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **No explicit mention** of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent terms.  
   - ""No one will care when I'm gone"" suggests a belief about others' indifference to their absence/death but **does not state a personal desire to die**.  
   - No expression of *wanting* to die or acting on suicidal thoughts.

   - **None present**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - **No description** of past or recent self-harm/suicidal actions. Focus is on emotional distress.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The core sentiment is hopelessness and worthlessness (""I'm pathetic,"" ""no one will care when I'm gone""), which indicates severe distress.  
   - **No explicit desire to die**, suicidal intent, plan, or action is expressed. The phrase ""when I'm gone"" is vague and passive, lacking personal agency or intent.  
   - Meets **Indicator** criteria: general distress without current personal suicidal desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""plan on ending it soon,"" which implies suicidal intent. It mentions a specific method: ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" (a misspelling of ""overdosing""), referred to as ""my go-to plan."" Emotional indicators include guilt (""overwhelmed by guilt""), hopelessness (""i dont know what else to do""), and ambivalence due to fear of pain (""pain scares me too much""). There is no mention of past actions or preparations (e.g., acquiring pills or writing a note), and the timing is uncertain (""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon""). The desire to die is present, but the fear of pain introduces some hesitation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through euphemisms like ""ending it soon,"" which, in context, clearly refers to suicide. There is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the guilt and fear are secondary to the expressed intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""overdosibg on ibuprofen,"" and it is identified as the ""go-to plan."" This constitutes a clear reference to a means of suicide, even though no actual preparations (e.g., having pills) are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""plan on ending it soon"") with uncertain timing. There is no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., taking pills or attempting). The content is focused on planning and consideration, not on actions that have been carried out.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of an explicit desire to die (""plan on ending it soon"") rules out 'Indicator'. The mention of a specific method (""overdosibg on ibuprofen"") as part of a plan moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which requires no plan or method). Since no concrete, initiated actions are described, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. Therefore, the post fits 'Behavior' due to the combination of suicidal intent and a stated method/plan.

89,"I wanna die, but other people need me and it sucks. Hello, in the last few months i became pretty okay with sucide, i'm not afraid of death really, i already have a plan and all the reasons, but i feel like i shouldn't leave yet because of the potential guilt i would feel if i leave others. I'm currently living for other people and don't really see a brighter future for myself so it's just a matter of time when i will stop giving a fuck about others as well. I was wondering if there is someone else with similar situation and what is stopping you from offing yourself? Telling your loved ones about it. I decided that it's my time to go, i'm not asking for support or anything, i am sure about this decision but i'm asking you how can i tell my family that it's my final decision and nothing will change my mind? I'm going to starve myself to death because i'm dealing with lots of issues that can't really be solved. I'm 20 years old and my parents are pushing me to live more and don't really understand the situation. They will probably keep telling me to eat which is only natural to say if you care about someone but i've made up my mind. So another question, can they force me to eat if i end up in hospital or drug me? Thanks. I got a question. Does anybody have any experience or knowledge with starvation/VSED? I have lots of health problems and decided it's finally my time to go. Heard it's actually quite peaceful to go this way so i wanted to hear your opinions on that. Thanks.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I wanna die,"" ""okay with suicide,"" ""have a plan,"" and ""my time to go.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""don't really see a brighter future""), feeling like a burden (""living for other people""), and resolved intent (""made up my mind"").  
   - Specific method: ""starve myself to death,"" with references to preparation (researching VSED—Voluntarily Stopping Eating and Drinking) and practical concerns (hospitalization, force-feeding).  
   - Imminence is implied (""matter of time"") but not immediate.  
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I am sure about this decision"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""I wanna die,"" ""okay with suicide,"" and ""my time to go.""  
   - **Yes**: Genuine desire to die is stated (""nothing will change my mind"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (""starve myself to death"") and preparations (researching VSED, asking about hospital protocols).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intentions (""I'm going to starve myself"") and preparatory steps (seeking information).  
   - **No** mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ongoing starvation or hospitalization).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - No evidence of initiated action (e.g., ""I started starving myself yesterday"") rules out **Attempt**.  
   - ""Plan"" and method details align with **Behavior**, not **Ideation** (which lacks concrete plans).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""going to kill myself.""  
   - Clear desire to die: ""decided on it,"" ""ain't no way I'm doing this shit for another year.""  
   - Preparation: ""got my suicidal notes ready.""  
   - Temporal context: Imminent timeframe (""matter of when and how,"" refusal to endure ""another year"").  
   - No past action described; focus is on future intent and current preparations.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes. Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""decided on it"" confirm a personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Yes. Preparations are explicitly stated (""got my suicidal notes ready"").  
   - While no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned, the act of preparing suicide notes constitutes concrete preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes future intent and current preparations.  
   - **No past or recent initiated lethal action** (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) + concrete preparations (suicide notes) = **Behavior**.  
   - Rules: Preparations (like notes) qualify as ""Behavior"" even without a disclosed method.  
   - Not ""Attempt"" because no action was initiated.

91,"not much to say. i'm lonely, crying, and feel empty numb and void. my body is weak and i feel half way dead already'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses emotional distress (lonely, crying, feeling empty, numb, void), physical weakness (body is weak), and a metaphorical state (feeling ""half way dead already""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The phrase ""half way dead"" is used descriptively to convey emotional exhaustion or despair, not as a literal reference to suicide or death. No temporal indicators of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") are present. The focus is on current feelings of hopelessness and numbness without any suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The expression ""feel half way dead already"" does not convey a clear desire to die; it is a figurative description of the author's emotional state. There is no indication of suicidal thoughts, wanted or unwanted. Thus, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned. The content is purely emotional and lacks any planning elements, so it does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings only, with no reference to past actions, future intentions, or initiated suicidal behaviors. Nothing suggests an actual attempt or self-initiated lethal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post fits 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress, sadness, hopelessness, and despair (e.g., loneliness, emptiness, feeling ""half way dead"") but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. The language is metaphorical and abstract, with no explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. Per the rules, since there is ambiguity about suicidal desire and no explicit intent, 'Indicator' is appropriate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including hopelessness (""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence""), self-loathing (""I don't like anything about myself""), and isolation. It explicitly states ""I want to die"" and references suicidal intent (""I am not going to kill myself""). However, it negates immediate action (""not any time soon"") by setting a 5-year timeframe. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions are mentioned. The focus is on emotional pain and a desire to ""exist without feeling anything.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""I want to die"" and ""I am not going to kill myself"" confirm personal suicidal ideation.  
   - Desire to die: Clear with ""I want to die.""  
   - Negation of intent: The author explicitly states they will not act ""any time soon,"" framing the thoughts as non-imminent but not explicitly *unwanted* (e.g., no phrasing like ""I don’t want these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) mentioned. The ""5 more years"" delay implies a lack of current planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes current despair but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""). The ""5 years"" comment explicitly postpones action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Suicidal desire is explicitly stated** (""I want to die""), moving it beyond *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** is indicated, ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of a past/recent initiated lethal action**, ruling out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions another person's potential suicide (""he killed himself"") but focuses on the author's feelings (""feel broken and useless"").  
   - Explicitly states a personal plan: ""i think at saturday i will go lay in some snow until I either freeze, or have a reason to live"".  
   - Method: Freezing to death (implied by ""lay in some snow until I freeze"").  
   - Temporal marker: ""at saturday"" (future plan).  
   - No reference to past actions by the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" for the author, but ""lay in snow until I freeze"" implies lethal intent to die. Desire is clear (""freeze"" as outcome).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Freezing via prolonged exposure in snow.  
   - Plan: Explicit future action (""at saturday i will go lay in some snow"").  
   - No mention of preparations (e.g., note, goodbyes), but method and timing are concrete.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a future intention (""will go"") with a specific timeframe (""saturday"").  
   - No past/current action initiated (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I started"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Expresses personal desire to die via freezing.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific method (freezing) and plan (Saturday) elevate it beyond mere desire.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No past/recent initiated lethal action.  
   - **Behavior**: Explicit future plan + method (""lay in snow until I freeze"") with clear suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions feelings of being ""broken,"" gender dysphoria (""man that feels like a woman""), existential despair (""My being in itself is a prison""), and self-perceived burden (""cause anguish and pain"").  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""Nothing feels right""), isolation (""Only 1 person left""), and distress (""Can't stand this anymore"").  
   - **Key phrase**: ""I'm better off dead"" expresses a passive death wish but lacks explicit suicidal terminology (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself""). No mention of methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit mention of suicide or active desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). The phrase ""better off dead"" suggests a *passive* wish for death rather than intent to act. No negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"") is present.

   - **Not Ideation**: While despair is evident, the lack of explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die"") or active intent rules out 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly describes a past action: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag.""  
   - Specific method is detailed (suffocation with tools and setup).  
   - Emotional indicators include intense frustration (""WHY! WHY! WHY!""), explicit desire to die (""I FUCKING WANTED TO""), and hopelessness (""THIS NEEDS TO END"").  
   - Future intent is stated (""I'm gonna try again tonight"") with a backup plan (""Plan B"").  
   - The core event is a recent, self-initiated, potentially lethal act (suffocation attempt).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""tried to kill myself,"" ""ALMOST FUCKING DIED,"" and ""I FUCKING WANTED TO"" confirm a current, personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (suffocation using mask/plastic bag) and preparations (setup under blankets) are described for the past attempt. Future plans are also mentioned (""try again tonight,"" ""Plan B"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a **concrete past action**: a potentially lethal suicide attempt (""tried to kill myself last night"") that was initiated but failed due to involuntary breathing. This is a self-initiated, life-threatening act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The description of a **past, initiated, potentially lethal action** (""tried to kill myself last night"") meets the definition of 'Attempt'.  
   - Future plans (""try again tonight,"" ""Plan B"") would typically suggest 'Behavior', but the **past attempt takes precedence** per the rules (historic/recent concrete actions override current ideation/plans).  
   - Key distinction: A past *action* (even if failed/interrupted) is 'Attempt', while future plans alone would be 'Behavior'. Here, the focus is on the completed past act.

97,"having a little bit of money helps but i'm still always stressed about it. at least i like my work, and i look forward to being around. well, just people, i guess. and sometimes people will talk to me. i do feel like shit when i come home alone every time though. i have my dog and i love her a lot, and i don't think i'd be able to make it if she wasn't here. but i broke up with my girlfriend of 8 years recently (prompting me to get a job or starve, basically) and i've never felt so alone. i haven't been alone since high school. we were always together. and now i don't have her, any partner, no friends, just. disconcerting silence. i wish i wasn't by myself here. i don't even necessarily want her back i just so desperately want a closeness and loving interdependence with someone. i don't want to disappear. being by myself it's like, am i even really here if there's no one around to see me? love me? talk to me? it just feels like, what's the point? i want to die so badly. i don't want to be lonely. i don't want to be alone. i want someone to just hurry up and come save me, even if i know there's no reason or way that would ever happen. i just. always feel so close to the brink. i don't want to survive long enough to be alone during winter when it's cold and dark. it's already getting like that so quickly. or during the happy holidays. i'm scared. i'm scared i'm scared i'm scareddd""",1,ideation,"<thinking>

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
