I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""thinking about ending my life again"" (explicit) and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" (strongly implied intent).  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Present (hopelessness, self-hatred, worthlessness: ""everything in my life is crap,"" ""I hate being myself"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific method (""jump off a bridge"") and location (""go to a bridge"") are mentioned.  
   - **Past Attempts/Preparations**: ""again"" implies recurring ideation but no described past *actions* (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I prepared"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Suicide Explicitly Mentioned/Implied**: Yes (""ending my life,"" ""jump off"").  
   - **Desire to Die**: Yes (""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific Method**: Yes (""jump off a bridge"").  
   - **Preparations/Imminent Intent**: Method is specified, but no explicit preparation (e.g., ""I am at the bridge"") or timing (e.g., ""tonight""). However, expressing a concrete plan (""go to a bridge"") elevates beyond passive ideation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Current/Future Intent**: Yes (""thinking about ending my life again"" + ""I want to go"").  
   - **Past Attempts**: ""again"" suggests prior ideation, but no description of a past *attempt* (e.g., no action taken).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - It surpasses **Ideation** by detailing a specific method/plan (""jump off a bridge"").  
   - It lacks evidence of a **past attempt** (no action described).  
   - **Behavior** fits: Explicit suicidal intent + specific method/plan, aligning with the definition (""specific plan or method"").

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key Elements**:  
     - Explicit mention of severe emotional distress (""I'm inconsolable"").  
     - Strongly implied desire to end life (""I'm going to die soon""), indicating expectation of self-inflicted death.  
     - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or actions described.  
     - No references to past attempts.  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - Suicide is **strongly implied** (""die soon"" in context of distress). → **Yes**  
     - Direct expression of wanting to die/not be alive. → **Yes**  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). → **No**  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Refers to future intent (""going to die soon""), not past actions. → **No past attempt**.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal intent** (""die soon"") but lacks any plan, method, or action.  
   - Severe hopelessness (""inconsolable"") combined with implied intent aligns with **Ideation** (defined as suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).  
   - Does not qualify for:  
     - *Indicator*: Suicidal intent is explicit.  
     - *Behavior*: No plan/action.  
     - *Attempt*: No past/current action described.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense distress (""I hate living"") and hopelessness about existence, framing life as meaningless (""just because two person fucked in a night"").  
   - No explicit mentions of suicide, death, self-harm, or dying (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it"").  
   - No implied expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone""); instead, it focuses on resentment toward life itself.  
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, past attempts, or imminent intent (e.g., no tools, locations, timing like ""tonight"").  
   - Emotional indicators include despair and frustration but lack suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.  
   - **Expressions of wanting to die?** No (distress is directed at living, not a desire to cease living).  
   - **Context**: Severe hopelessness without implied suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Methods mentioned?** No.  
   - **Preparations/actions?** No.  
   - **Imminent intent?** No.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References are general/ongoing (""sometime I think""), not past actions or future plans.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows profound distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit/implied suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Vague dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""hate living"") without expressing a desire to die or take action.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post contains the direct phrase ""Help me kill myself,"" which is an explicit expression of suicidal intent. The request for assistance to end one's life confirms a strong desire to die. (Yes)  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: While despair is implied (pleading for help), the focus is on actionable intent rather than emotional states alone.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: The method (""barbiturates/Nembutal"") is explicitly named, and the request to ""find"" these drugs indicates active preparation to acquire lethal means. (Yes)  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No mention of past actions or attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"") and expresses a direct desire to die. (Yes)  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific drugs (barbiturates/Nembutal) are mentioned as the method.  
   - Preparatory actions (seeking help to obtain the drugs) are evident.  
   - Immediacy is implied through the urgent plea (""Help me"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The language (""help me,"" ""find"") points to current/future intent, not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Ideation**: Insufficient, as the post includes a specific method and preparation.  
   - **Behavior**: Matches—explicit suicidal intent combined with method specification (barbiturates) and active preparation (seeking drugs).  
   - **Attempt**: Does not describe a past or initiated action.

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""I want to sleep forever"" strongly implies a desire to end life, and ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain"" directly references dying methods. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm tired,"" ""I feel worthless""), shame (""selfish,"" ""lazy""), and isolation.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: The post asks generally about a ""painless way to die"" but does **not** specify a concrete method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note). No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future desires (""I want to sleep forever""), with no mention of past attempts or actions taken.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses **explicit desire to die** (""sleep forever"") and **directly references dying methods**, meeting the threshold for suicidal ideation.
   - However, it lacks **specific plans, preparations, or imminent intent** required for ""behavior."" No past actions are described, ruling out ""attempt."" General distress alone would be ""indicator,"" but the strong implied intent elevates it to ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""why shouldn't we just kill ourselves,"" and ""I still want to die"" explicitly express a desire to end life. The post also includes strong implications of suicidal intent (e.g., ""life is all pointless,"" ""none of it will matter when you're dead"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Clear hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""life is all pointless,"" ""huge waste of time""), but these are secondary to explicit suicidal expressions.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., buying tools), or actions taken are mentioned. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on persistent thoughts (""for a year straight"") and current ideation (""I still want to die""), but **no past attempts or actions** are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""why shouldn't we just kill ourselves"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present.  
   - **Conclusion**: Explicit intent confirms suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing.  
   - **Conclusion**: Lacks criteria for ""behavior"" or ""attempt.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes ongoing thoughts (past year) and current desire to die, but **no past attempts or actions**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post contains **explicit expressions of suicidal desire** (""kill myself,"" ""want to die"") without plans, methods, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Strong suicidal thoughts without concrete steps toward action.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Explicit suicidal intent moves beyond vague distress.  
   - *Not Behavior/Attempt*: No plans, actions, or past attempts.

Please, I don't want it to continue, I can't handle it, I want it to stop. I hate everything, I need peace.",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post contains strong implications of suicidal intent (""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I don’t wanna survive it""). These phrases express a clear desire to end life, not just distress.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe mental pain, desperation (""I can’t handle it""), and a plea for cessation (""I want it to stop"") amplify the suicidal context.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned. However, the phrase ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" hints at self-harm as a potential pathway, though it is not explicit. Crucially, **imminent timing (""tonight"")** is repeatedly emphasized.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on **current/future intent** (""tonight""), with no references to past attempts.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to end life (""I want to be gone tonight"") and refusal to survive align with **suicidal ideation**.
   - However, the **imminent timeframe (""tonight"")** elevates this beyond passive thoughts. Category definitions specify that strong intent with imminent timing (even without a method) warrants **'behavior'**.
   - No concrete actions (e.g., acquiring tools) or past attempts are described, ruling out 'attempt'. General distress is overshadowed by the urgency of intent, ruling out 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""I just wanna die"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die. The statement ""It's the best for me"" reinforces suicidal intent.  
     - *Explicit suicide mention*: **Yes**.  
     - *Expression of wanting to die*: **Yes**.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I don't have a purpose""), despair (""sick of feeling pain""), and worthlessness are present.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes current feelings (""I'm just feeling sick"") and desires (""I just wanna die""). No reference to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I just wanna die""), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - No evidence of plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts exists. The distress and hopelessness alone would default to *Indicator*, but explicit suicidal intent elevates it to **Ideation**.

It's so tiring to try to love yourself when your own mind is against you. I know really know what this is a symptom of. I just feel tired and lonely because of these thoughts.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself,"" indicating direct suicidal thoughts. However, the writer clarifies, ""but I don’t actually want to,"" showing ambivalence.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong distress is present (e.g., ""tired,"" ""lonely,"" self-critical thoughts like ""I’m ugly and stupid""), but these alone do not elevate the category without explicit suicidal intent.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, plans, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The thoughts are intrusive but lack actionable steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes ongoing intrusive thoughts (""keeps telling me""), with no reference to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself""), and the writer expresses a desire to reject these thoughts. The emotional context (distress + explicit suicidal language) confirms suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent are present. The absence of concrete plans or actions rules out ""behavior"" or ""attempt.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current intrusive thoughts, not past actions. No reference to attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post contains **explicit suicidal ideation** (""kill myself"") but lacks plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions. The writer’s ambivalence (""I don’t actually want to"") does not negate the presence of active suicidal thoughts. This aligns with the **Ideation** category (explicit thoughts without plans/actions).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Direct statements include ""kill myself,"" ""I want to die now, right now,"" and ""shoot their heads off like me."" Strong emotional despair (e.g., ""I’m damaged,"" ""void,"" ""no space for me"") reinforces intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are mentioned: ""run towards a cop with a knife"" and ""find a dealer with some opioids."" Imminent intent is explicit (""die now, right now"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intent (""want to die now""). No past attempts described—only current plans and ideation.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** due to explicit suicidal intent (e.g., ""kill myself"").
   - It surpasses **Ideation** because specific methods (knife/opioids) and imminent timing (""right now"") are stated.
   - **Attempt** is ruled out as no past/concluded actions are described.
   - **Behavior** fits: Combines explicit ideation (""want to die"") with methods and imminent intent, aligning with the definition of actionable plans without completed attempts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""I just want to get it over with"" strongly implies a desire to end life, especially when paired with ""the pain if I go through with it."" This is not vague hopelessness but indicates active suicidal intent (Yes).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Mentions of deterioration, fear of harm, isolation, and refusal of hospitalization reinforce severe distress.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: While fear of pain (""how much it will hurt"") references a potential method, no specific plan, tools, or preparations are described. The post focuses on contemplation, not actionable steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: All statements reflect current/future intent (""if I go through with it""). No past attempts are mentioned.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out—explicit implied intent exists.
   - **Behavior**: Ruled out—no specific method, preparation, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Attempt**: Ruled out—no description of past actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or implied references to suicide, death, self-harm, or dying (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""die,"" ""end it,"" or equivalents). The phrase ""I’d leave myself if I could"" expresses a desire to escape emotional pain but lacks suicidal intent (e.g., it’s metaphorical, not literal).  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""everyone leaves you eventually""), despair (""it still hurts""), and self-blame (""I push people away""). However, these remain in the realm of general distress without crossing into suicidal desire.  
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., notes, research), or actions taken toward self-harm.  
   - **Past Attempts**: No references to prior suicide attempts or self-injurious behaviors.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on recurring feelings and relational patterns (""I always think""), not current/future intent or past actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses severe hopelessness and isolation but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent** (e.g., no wish to die, no references to ending life).  
   - Emotional distress (e.g., ""it still hurts"") and defeatist thoughts (""I’d leave myself if I could"") align with **Indicator**, as they reflect generalized despair without progression to ideation, plans, or behaviors.

Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""the only way out is suicide"" and ""I’ve considered hanging.""
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I feel so empty,"" ""things are crushing""), despair (""I’m never good enough""), and shame (""it’s just so embarrassing"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific method mentioned (""hanging""). However, the post explicitly states no action was taken (""I can’t seem to go through with it""). No preparations or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are indicated.
   - **Temporal Context**: All references are to *current* thoughts (""I feel,"" ""I’ve considered""). No past attempts described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly referenced (""suicide"") and strongly implied (""make my escape"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (""the only way out is suicide"").  
   - **Conclusion**: Strong evidence for suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A method (""hanging"") is specified.  
   - **However**, the post denies taking action (""I can’t seem to go through with it,"" ""I don’t have the guts""). No preparations or imminent intent are described.  
   - **Conclusion**: Method mentioned, but no behavior/action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future ideation (""I feel,"" ""I’ve considered"").  
   - No past attempts disclosed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No. Explicit suicidal intent moves beyond vague distress.  
   - **Behavior?** No. Despite mentioning a method, there is no evidence of preparation, action, or imminent intent.  
   - **Attempt?** No. No past or current suicidal actions described.  
   - **Ideation?** Yes. The post expresses active suicidal thoughts (""I’ve considered hanging"") and desire to escape via suicide, but explicitly rules out action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - ""kill myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide.  
     - ""suicidal notes"" strongly implies intent to die.  
     - **Conclusion**: Explicit intent is clear (Yes/Yes).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - ""decided on it"" and ""matter of when and how"" indicate active planning.  
     - ""I already got my suicidal notes ready"" confirms **preparation** (a concrete action taken).  
     - No specific method (e.g., pills) is stated, but preparations exist.  
     - **Conclusion**: Preparations (notes) elevate this beyond mere thoughts.  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Refers to future intent (""going to kill myself,"" ""not doing this for another year"").  
     - No mention of past attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal intent** (""kill myself""), moving it beyond *Indicator*.  
   - It includes **preparations** (suicidal notes ready), which is a key criterion for *Behavior*.  
   - While no specific method or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated, preparations alone qualify as *Behavior* per the definition.  
   - This does not describe a past *Attempt*, and ideation is present but superseded by preparatory actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or implied references to death, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""end my life,"" or ""be gone forever""). The desire to ""be someone else"" expresses identity distress, not suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong feelings of self-loathing, hopelessness, and body dysmorphia are present (e.g., ""I hate everything about myself,"" ""I feel so ugly"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: No references to past attempts or future plans for self-harm; focuses on ongoing emotional distress.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.  
   - **Expressions of wanting to die?** No. The core sentiment is a wish to escape self-image (""be someone else""), not to cease living.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific methods/preparations?** None. Actions described (dying hair, changing clothes) relate to self-image modification, not self-harm.  
   - **Imminent intent?** No time-bound urgency (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Past attempts?** None mentioned.  
   - **Current/future intent?** Distress is chronic, not actionable.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but lacks **explicit/implied suicidal intent** required for *Ideation*.  
   - No evidence of plans, preparations, or actions (*Behavior*) or past attempts (*Attempt*).  
   - Fits *Indicator*: Vague unhappiness (e.g., ""I wish I could be someone else"") without suicidal desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post discusses *others* who post about suicide (""anyone that posts they are going to kill themselves""), questioning their motivations.  
   - No explicit or implied expressions of the author’s own suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or intent (e.g., no ""I want to die,"" ""I have a plan,"" or past personal attempts).  
   - Emotional tone is analytical/opinion-based (e.g., ""in my opinion""), not personal despair or hopelessness.  
   - Focuses on interpreting others' behavior (""looking for help""), not self-referential risk.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**: Suicide is mentioned only in reference to third parties, not the author. No direct/implied desire for self-harm by the author.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No description of methods, preparations, or imminent intent by the author.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **No**: References others’ potential actions, not the author’s past or current suicidal behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses no personal suicidal ideation, plan, or action. General discussion of suicide without self-involvement aligns with **Indicator** (distress/vague references lacking explicit personal intent).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"" explicitly mention suicide. Other statements (e.g., ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""so tired of being alive"") strongly imply a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. The post expresses hopelessness (""its never going to happen""), despair (""Im so tired and sad""), and worthlessness (""every thing you do... hurts the people you love"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The focus is on past actions and general intent.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: Yes. The user explicitly states, ""the past two times ive tried ive failed,"" indicating concrete past suicide attempts with suicidal intent, even if incomplete.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""no point in being alive anymore"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"").  
   - **Verdict**: Yes, clear suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are described.  
   - No imminent timing (e.g., ""now,"" ""tonight"") is indicated for future actions.  
   - **Verdict**: Absent. The post emphasizes past actions, not current plans or behaviors.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The phrase ""the past two times ive tried"" explicitly references prior suicide attempts, confirming they occurred in the past.  
   - Current statements (e.g., ""I want to... kill myself"") reflect ongoing ideation, but the core evidence points to historical actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes suicidal ideation (explicit desire to die) but is elevated by the clear description of past attempts (""tried two times"").  
   - Per the rules:  
     - **Attempt** applies when a past suicide attempt (even incomplete or interrupted) is described with suicidal intent.  
     - The example for Attempt (""I put a belt around my neck tonight but stopped..."") mirrors this post's structure (past action + interruption).  
     - Even with current ideation (""I want to kill myself""), the disclosure of past attempts takes precedence for classification.  
   - **Why not other categories?**  
     - Not **Indicator**: Explicit suicidal intent and past attempts go beyond vague distress.  
     - Not **Ideation**: While ideation is present, the past attempts move it to a higher-risk category.  
     - Not **Behavior**: No current plans, methods, or imminent actions are described.

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""desire to kill myself,"" ""Killing myself is painful,"" and strong implications like ""I just want out of that tunnel... I'd honestly choose [getting hit by a train].""
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""Why bother?""), despair (""waste your energy""), and worthlessness (""it's meant literally nothing"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Mentions overdosing as a method but only in the context of **past actions** (""I've attempted an overdose twice within the past two weeks""). No current plan or imminent preparation (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: Explicitly describes past suicide attempts: ""attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (train metaphor). **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (overdosing) are referenced but **only for past attempts**. No current plan, preparation, or imminent timing (e.g., ""now,"" ""tonight"") is indicated for future actions. **No current behavior**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **past attempts** (""I've attempted...""). Current expressions (""desire to kill myself"") reflect ongoing ideation but lack actionable steps or immediacy.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post describes **concrete past suicide attempts** (overdoses), which meets the 'Attempt' definition: ""a past suicide attempt, including incomplete... actions.""  
   - Current suicidal thoughts (""desire to kill myself"") are present but secondary to the clear disclosure of past attempts. Per the rules: ""If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""end it"" strongly implies suicidal intent, especially in context. Expressions like ""NO hope left"" and ""time to end it"" show a clear desire to die.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, but ""Now it’s time to end it"" signals imminent intent.  
   - **Temporal Context**: References to past actions (""I tried. And I tried again..."") indicate repeated suicide attempts. The phrase ""tried"" implies concrete past actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes **past attempts** (""I tried..."") with suicidal intent.  
   - Even with current ideation (""Now it’s time to end it""), the **clear description of past attempts** overrides other categories.

   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") mentioned.
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal thoughts are described as recurring (""everyday"") but not tied to a past or current action. The phrase ""In the pas[t] I tried to hide this..."" refers to masking emotions, not a suicide attempt.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal ideation (""thinking about suicide"").
   - **Behavior**: Absent—no plans, methods, or preparatory actions described.
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no mention of past suicide actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" with suicidal intent).

   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The post outlines two specific options: (1) going to the ER to disclose suicidal intent for hospitalization, or (2) acting on suicidal urges. Preparatory language includes ""I plan on going to a hospital"" and ""tell them I'm going to kill myself."" Imminent intent is implied (""last post ever,"" ""Goodbye"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intent (""still debating,"" ""haven’t left home yet"") with no reference to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (e.g., ""kill myself"") and strongly implied (e.g., ""last post ever""). **Yes**.  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present. **Yes**.  
   - Context confirms active suicidal intent, moving beyond vague distress.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct phrases like ""I can't kill myself"" and ""I'm suicidal,"" confirming explicit expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I'm not special to anything or anyone""), despair (""there's no me at this point""), and distrust (""they insist they care but I don't believe it"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method (jumping off a ""clif"" [cliff]) and location (4–5km away) are mentioned. The phrase ""I know a good clif... it’s possible to get there"" indicates consideration of a concrete plan, even though ambivalence is expressed (""I just can’t commit to it"").
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. The post discusses current suicidal thoughts and plans but does not describe any past suicide attempts or actions.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intentions (e.g., ""I can’t kill myself"" implies present struggle; the cliff plan is framed as a feasible but unconsummated action). No past attempts are mentioned.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator Ruled Out**: Explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself,"" ""suicidal"") moves this beyond vague distress.
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: While passive thoughts are present, the specific method (cliff) and logistical details (distance, accessibility) constitute a ""plan"" under the *Behavior* definition, even if commitment is lacking. The ambivalence (""can’t commit to it"") does not negate the presence of a concrete plan.
   - **Attempt Ruled Out**: No description of past actions taken toward suicide (e.g., visiting the cliff or self-harm).
   - **Final Fit**: *Behavior* best aligns due to explicit suicidal intent coupled with a specific plan/method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post contains expressions of severe distress (e.g., ""i wish i was never born,"" ""i just want it all to stop""). However, these are **vague wishes to escape pain or existence** rather than explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent (e.g., no direct phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong themes of hopelessness, exhaustion, self-loathing, isolation, and despair are present.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: **No specific methods, plans, preparations, or imminent timing** (e.g., pills, dates, locations) are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context/Attempts**: Refers solely to **current emotional struggles**; no references to past actions, attempts, or concrete steps.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**. Phrases like ""I wish I was never born"" suggest a desire to escape life but lack explicit/immediate suicidal intent (e.g., ""I will end my life"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None**. No methods, preparations, or imminent actions described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **ongoing feelings**; no past behaviors or attempts referenced.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **extreme distress and hopelessness** but does not cross into explicit/implied suicidal intent, plans, or actions.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Vague references to suffering (e.g., ""want it all to stop"") without clear desire to die or actionable intent. Severe distress alone is insufficient for ""Ideation"" without explicit suicidal thoughts.

28,"Depressed. This month has already been a shit show, texted my mom I think I need to be on anti depressants and she just said 'schedule a doctors appointment' not 'are you okay? Do you want to talk?' I can't wait to fucking kill myself and have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral. It's gonna be one last big fuck you",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"" is a direct, unambiguous expression of suicidal intent. The mention of ""have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral"" further implies a desire for death as retaliation.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""Depressed,"" ""shit show""), anger (""fucking,"" ""fake ass friends,"" ""shitty family""), and hopelessness (feeling dismissed by family) are present but secondary to the explicit suicidal statement.
   - **Plan or Method**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) are mentioned. The phrase ""I can't wait"" suggests intent but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to future intent (""I can't wait to...""), not past actions or attempts. No history of attempts is described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (funeral as ""last big fuck you""). **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are specified. **No**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on future desire, not past actions. **No past attempt described**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal intent (""kill myself"") but lacks specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions. This aligns with **Ideation** (suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).  
   - *Why not other categories?*  
     - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent.  
     - **Behavior**: Requires plans/methods/preparations—none present.

I'm not gonna tell anyone either, all ready tried that before and no one really understands. So goodbye everybody, I doubt anyone will care.",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""end it all"" and ""goodbye everybody"" strongly imply suicidal intent. The statement ""I’m finally ready"" confirms a current desire to act.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""no one really understands,"" ""I doubt anyone will care"") and isolation (""I’m not gonna tell anyone"") are present but secondary to explicit intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The user states, ""I already know how I’m gonna do it,"" indicating a specific method. Preparation is implied by ""I’m gonna wait a few weeks,"" showing intent with a timeline.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on future intent (""gonna wait a few weeks""). The phrase ""all ready tried that before"" refers to past help-seeking (not a suicide attempt), so no past suicidal actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is strongly implied (""end it all"") → **Yes**.  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die (""I’m ready to just end it all"") → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method is mentioned (""I already know how I’m gonna do it"") → **Yes**.  
   - Preparations are implied (waiting period) → **Yes**.  
   - Imminent intent is not immediate (""wait a few weeks""), but a concrete plan exists → Leans toward **Behavior**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to future intentions (""gonna wait a few weeks"") → **Current/Future**.  
   - No past attempts described (""tried that before"" refers to seeking help, not suicidal actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes explicit suicidal intent (""end it all"") and a specific plan (""know how I’m gonna do it""), satisfying the **Behavior** category (defined as suicidal thoughts plus a plan/preparations).  
   - It does not describe a past attempt (ruling out ""Attempt"") and goes beyond vague distress or passive ideation due to the stated plan (ruling out ""Indicator"" and ""Ideation"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct statements: ""I can't even fucking kill myself"" and ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong themes of hopelessness (""I'm a disappointment""), worthlessness (""I'm everything wrong with the world""), and perceived burden (""My existence screws up everyone's lives"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The phrase ""I hold the blade"" indicates a specific method (cutting with a blade) and an action taken (physically holding the tool).
   - **Temporal Context**: The language (""I hold the blade,"" ""I can't fucking do it"") describes a current, active struggle with acting on suicidal thoughts. No mention of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Suicide Explicitly Mentioned**: Yes (""kill myself,"" ""if I did it"").  
   - **Expressions of Wanting to Die**: Yes (""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"").  
   - **Emotional Context**: Severe distress with explicit intent, confirming beyond ""indicator.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific Method**: Yes (""blade"" for self-harm).  
   - **Preparations/Actions Taken**: Yes (""I hold the blade"").  
   - **Imminent Intent**: Implied through present-tense action (""I hold""), leaning toward ""behavior.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current actions/intent** (holding the blade now). No references to past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds ""ideation"" due to the **specific method (blade)** and **action taken (holding it)**, placing it in ""behavior."" The absence of a completed or past attempt rules out ""attempt."" General distress alone is insufficient for ""indicator"" given explicit suicidal intent and preparatory action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""how about i die then"" strongly implies a desire to die, framed as a rhetorical question (""is that what you ask for?""). This goes beyond vague distress.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""life's not about being yourself""), despair (""depressed 16 year old""), and perceived rejection (""family doesn't like... but doesn't deal with him"") are present.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - ""killing myself will happen"" → Explicit mention of suicide.  
     - ""I will be taking my own life"" → Explicit declaration of intent.  
     - **Conclusion**: Strongly implies desire to die (**Yes**).  

   - **Plan/Method Identification**:  
     - Preparation: ""I have this [suicide intent] on my computer wallpaper now"" (daily reminder).  
     - Timeline: ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday (2023)"" → Future intent but **no specific method** (e.g., pills, jumping) or **imminent timing** (e.g., ""tonight"").  
     - **Conclusion**: Preparation exists, but lacks concrete method/immediacy.  

   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Focuses on **future intent** (""will happen,"" ""I will be taking"").  
     - ""At least I DID try"" likely references past struggles, **not a suicide attempt** (no action described).

   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/current suicidal **action** (e.g., ""I tried to..."").

     - *Ideation*: Explicit desire to die (""taking my own life"") + generalized timeline (before 2023) but **no method/immediate plan**.  
     - *Behavior*: Requires either (1) method, (2) preparation **with action** (e.g., ""bought pills""), or (3) imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight""). The wallpaper is passive preparation, not an action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct phrases like ""kill myself"" (stated twice) and expresses regret for not acting on a past opportunity to die (""I was a pussy... I shouldn’t have talked myself down""). Strong desire to die is evident (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness, regret, and emotional exhaustion (""I’m so tired... criticized and unloved"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method, plan, or preparation for a future attempt is mentioned. The reference to a past ""opportunity"" lacks details about methods or actions taken. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on a past event (""6 months ago"") where the user considered suicide but did not act. Current statements express ongoing ideation (""Everyday I want to..."") but no recent actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit mention: **Yes** (""kill myself"").  
   - Desire to die: **Yes** (regret over not acting, daily wish to die).  
   - Emotional context supports suicidal intent (severe regret + hopelessness).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method/preparation: **No**.  
   - Imminent intent: **No** (no timeframe like ""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past event: Referenced (""6 months ago""), but no action occurred (self-interrupted before attempt).  
   - Current/future intent: Ideation is present (""Everyday I want to...""), but no actionable steps.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire and regret over a past opportunity but **lacks details of a plan, method, or preparatory actions**. The reference to ""6 months ago"" describes contemplation, not an attempt (no action was initiated). Current statements reflect persistent ideation without behavioral escalation.  
   - **Indicator?** No: Explicit suicidal intent moves beyond vague distress.  
   - **Behavior?** No: Absence of plans, methods, or imminent actions.  
   - **Attempt?** No: No description of a concrete past action (e.g., ""I started but stopped""). The user only mentions an opportunity they did not act upon.

I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No. The post describes emotional distress (""I'm pathetic,"" ""embarrassing myself,"" ""weak"") and interpersonal struggles, but there are no explicit or strongly implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""end it all,"" or equivalents).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. The author expresses hopelessness (""it's never gonna happen""), shame (""I'm pathetic""), and helplessness (""too weak,"" ""continue to be used""). However, these remain confined to relational distress without implying suicidal intent.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No. No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: No references to past suicide attempts, actions, or future plans. Focus is on ongoing emotional pain and relational conflict.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post lacks **explicit/implied suicidal intent** (required for Ideation/Behavior/Attempt). Distress is present but centers on feelings of worthlessness and social conflict.
   - Severe hopelessness alone is insufficient for escalation beyond **Indicator** per guidelines; suicidal ideation must be explicit or strongly implied.

My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - The phrase ""I just want to not exist"" strongly implies a desire to cease living, aligning with passive suicidal ideation.  
     - The metaphorical use of ""kill myself"" (referring to overworking) is not literal but contextualized as non-suicidal.  
     - **Verdict**: *Yes* (strongly implied desire to not exist).  

   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) are mentioned.  
     - No preparations (e.g., gathering tools) or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") are described.  
     - **Verdict**: *No*.  

   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Focuses on current emotional pain (e.g., ""I feel nothing but sadness,"" ""I just want to not exist"").  
     - No references to past attempts, actions, or future plans.  
     - **Verdict**: *Current/future intentions without action*.  

   - **Emotional Indicators**:  
     - Intense hopelessness (""Never have I felt a lasting happiness""), isolation (""No one in my life understands me""), self-loathing (""God I fucking hate myself""), and worthlessness (""morally abhorrent piece of crap"").  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core statement **""I just want to not exist""** is a hallmark of passive suicidal ideation, indicating a desire to die without active planning.  
   - While despair and self-hatred are severe, they lack:  
     - Explicit plans/methods (ruling out *behavior*).  
     - Descriptions of past actions (ruling out *attempt*).  
     - Vague distress alone (e.g., ""life isn’t worth living"") would fit *indicator*, but the explicit wish to ""not exist"" elevates it to *ideation*.  
   - **Conclusion**: Fits *ideation* (explicitly implied desire to die without plans/actions).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""suicide watch,"" ""end it,"" and ""take a bunch of pills,"" directly implying suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""wasn’t made for life,"" ""loathe myself""), despair (""can’t keep doing this""), and shame (""accomplished nothing"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Specific method mentioned (""take a bunch of pills"") and timing (""while everyone’s asleep"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to current/future intentions (""could take pills"") with no mention of past attempts.
   - **Intent vs. Hesitation**: While fear of pain and guilt are noted (""too scared,"" ""don’t want to make my mother sad""), the explicit plan and timing override passive ideation.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds **Ideation** due to the specific method (pills) and preparatory timing (waiting until others are asleep).
   - It fits **Behavior** because it combines explicit suicidal desire (""end it"") with a concrete plan and imminent context, despite expressed fears.
   - No past actions or attempts are described, ruling out **Attempt**. General distress alone is insufficient for **Indicator**.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

     - The post explicitly references the friend's suicidal intent: ""Friend may kill himself soon"" and ""he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days).""  
     - **Yes**, suicide is strongly implied for the friend (e.g., ""commit suicide,"" ""kill himself"").  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools) is mentioned for the friend.  
     - However, the post notes **imminent timing** (""could be days""), indicating strong intent without explicit method details.  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - The friend’s suicidal intent is described as current/future (""going to commit suicide... near future"").  
     - The user mentions their *own* past attempt (""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009""), but this does not apply to the friend.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The friend’s situation involves **explicit suicidal intent** (""commit suicide,"" ""kill himself"") with **imminent timing** (""days"").  
   - No specific method or preparation is described, but the combination of explicit intent + imminent timing aligns with **Behavior** (per guidelines: ""strong intent with imminent timing... even without a method"").  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past/current concrete action initiated by the friend (e.g., ""I tried"").  
   - **Not Ideation**: The imminent timing elevates it beyond passive thoughts.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit suicidal intent disqualifies this category.

Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""lol kermit sewer slide"" is a clear euphemism for ""commit suicide"" (phonetically similar). The post explicitly references recurring suicidal thoughts (""I still get the... thoughts"") and describes them as ""tempting.""
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I'm scared therapy won't work""), shame (""live every moment in shame""), and exhaustion (""tired of always being afraid"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent actions (e.g., no tools, locations, or timing like ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to ongoing suicidal thoughts (""still get... thoughts"") with no mention of past attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied through euphemistic language (""kermit sewer slide""), and there are direct expressions of persistent suicidal ideation (""tempting a lot of the time"").  
   - **Verdict**: Yes (Explicit/Implied).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent described.  
   - **Verdict**: No.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current ideation without references to past actions.  
   - **Verdict**: Present/future thoughts only.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post confirms suicidal ideation (explicit euphemism + recurring temptation) but lacks plans, preparations, or references to past/current actions.  
   - **Indicator?** No: Explicit ideation moves beyond vague distress.  
   - **Behavior?** No: Absence of methods/preparations.  
   - **Attempt?** No: No description of concrete actions taken.  
   - **Ideation?** Yes: Fits the definition of explicit suicidal thoughts without plans or actions.

But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit suicide mentions**: Yes (""I want to kill myself so badly,"" ""wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train"").  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Strong despair, self-loathing, hopelessness (e.g., ""I hate myself,"" ""I shouldn’t exist,"" ""my life is disgusting"").  
   - **Plan/method identification**: Specific method mentioned (""jump in front of a train"") and practical considerations (e.g., concerns about belongings/phone).  
   - **References to past attempts**: None.  
   - **Temporal context**: Current/future intent (""want to kill myself,"" ""wish I had the guts""), no past actions described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""jump in front of a train"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: Yes.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Yes (""jump in front of a train"").  
   - Preparations/actions: Indirectly referenced (end-of-life logistics like belongings/phone).  
   - Imminent intent: Not explicit (e.g., no ""tonight""), but method specificity is clear.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current desires/future intent. No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out—explicit suicidal intent is present.  
   - **Ideation**: Suicidal thoughts are explicit, but the specific method (""jump in front of a train"") and practical preparations (belongings) push beyond passive ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post opens with ""I want to kill myself,"" which is an explicit declaration of suicidal intent. Repetitive phrases like ""everyone would be better off with me dead"" reinforce a strong desire to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Extreme distress (""I can't breathe""), self-loathing (""I'm useless""), and hopelessness (""everyone would be better off with me dead"") are present but secondary to the explicit suicidal statement.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The language reflects current intent (""I want to kill myself"") with no references to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit statement ""I want to kill myself"" meets the **Ideation** threshold: strong desire to die without evidence of planning, preparation, or past actions.  
   - Emotional distress alone would fall under *Indicator*, but the explicit suicidal intent overrides this.  
   - Absence of methods/preparations rules out *Behavior*; no past actions rule out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""thought about slitting my wrists"" explicitly references a suicidal method (self-harm via wrist-slitting) and implies a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Present (e.g., ""mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" ""feeling more alone""), but these support rather than define the category.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: A specific method (""slitting my wrists"") is mentioned, but the post explicitly states no action was taken (""but i didnt do it""). No preparations, imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""), or actions are described.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a recent thought (""today"") with no indication of past attempts. The phrase ""but i didnt do it"" confirms the thought did not escalate to action.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal ideation** (specific method: wrist-slitting) but lacks evidence of preparation, enactment, or imminent intent. The statement ""but i didnt do it"" confirms it remained a thought, not behavior or attempt.
   - **Ideation** is the best fit: Strong suicidal desire with a method is described, yet no action occurred. Emotional distress alone is secondary to the explicit ideation.
   - *Not Behavior*: No actions/preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) or imminent intent (e.g., ""doing it now"").
   - *Not Attempt*: No description of initiated or interrupted actions.
   - *Not Indicator*: Suicidal intent is explicit, moving beyond vague distress.

I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" explicitly references suicidal ideation.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Shame (""I feel so ashamed""), hopelessness (""paying the price""), and physical pain (teeth pain) are present, but these support rather than define the category.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of specific methods (e.g., pills), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to recurring feelings (""coming back""), not a past attempt or current action.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core statement ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" confirms **explicit suicidal thoughts** (Ideation).  
   - No evidence of plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent (ruling out Behavior).  
   - No description of past/current suicide actions (ruling out Attempt).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post directly references ""suicide notes"" and uses phrases like ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""goodbye letters,"" strongly implying imminent self-harm. The statement ""My minds made up"" confirms intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Desperation and resolve are evident (e.g., ""Don't say please don't go. Stay. My minds made up"").
   - **Plan or Preparation**: Yes. The user seeks help to write suicide notes, a concrete preparatory action tied to suicidal intent. The phrase ""leaving soon"" implies imminent timing.
   - **Past Attempts**: None mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly referenced via ""suicide notes,"" and intent is strongly implied (""leaving soon,"" ""goodbye letters""). **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific actions are described (preparing suicide notes), confirming preparatory behavior. Imminent timing (""leaving soon"") reinforces this. **Yes**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""I'm leaving soon,"" ""need help on the goodbye letters""). No past attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *ideation* by detailing preparatory actions (writing suicide notes) and expressing imminent intent (""leaving soon,"" ""minds made up""). This aligns with **Behavior**, defined as suicidal intent coupled with concrete preparations or actions, even without a specific method mentioned.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon,"" and ""save some flowers for me"" strongly imply suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness, distrust (""I TRuST NOT 1 SINGLE soul""), trauma, and despair are present.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: A specific timeline is stated (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it""), indicating imminent intent.
   - **Temporal Context**: References past attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts"") and current/future plans (""I end thing v v soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied (""suicide date,"" ""end thing"") and paired with imminent timing. **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A concrete timeline is provided (May 14, 2021, or sooner), signaling imminent intent. **Yes**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts"") and future intent (""suicide date"") are both present. However, **current imminent plans dominate**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes suicidal ideation (""I wanna live if I could get help"") but exceeds this by specifying a near-future plan (""suicide date"") without detailing methods. This aligns with **Behavior**, defined as ""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method.""  
   - Past attempts (""constant attempts"") alone would suggest ""Attempt,"" but the primary focus is on impending action (""This Friday... or before it""), making ""Behavior"" the most urgent classification.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post includes strong implications of wanting to die or cease existing (e.g., ""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35""). While no direct terms like ""suicide"" are used, the emotional context (hopelessness, distress) and phrases like ""in my grave I lay"" imply a desire to end life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""pointlessness,"" ""sickening""), hopelessness (""I don’t want to look on the bright-side""), and rejection of existence (""I want to be the missing pixel"").  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions taken are mentioned. The reference to dying by age 35 lacks immediacy or concrete steps.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on future intent (""I will die by 35"") without references to past attempts or actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Strongly implied expressions of wanting to die?** Yes (""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35"").  
   - **Severe distress with implied intent?** Yes (hopelessness + desire to cease existing).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific methods?** No.  
   - **Preparations/actions?** No.  
   - **Imminent intent?** No (timeframe ""by 35"" is distant, not immediate).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References future intent (""die by 35""), not past events or attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a strong desire to die/cease existing (""disappear forever,"" ""die by 35"") and severe hopelessness, meeting **Ideation** criteria.  
   - Lacks plans, methods, or actions, ruling out **Behavior**/**Attempt**. Vague despair alone would be **Indicator**, but explicit desire to die elevates it to **Ideation**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal desire (""I'm trying to die"") and evaluates methods, placing it beyond *Indicator* (general distress without intent).  
   - While methods are mentioned, there is **no indication of preparation, imminent intent, or action taken**. This aligns with *Ideation* (thoughts with method consideration but no concrete steps).

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""nobody loves or cares for me""), self-loathing (""coward"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific method (pills) + preparation (""count my pills"" nightly).
   - **Temporal Context**: Recurrent behavior (nightly counting) and regret over inaction. No past attempt described.
   - **Intent**: Imminent risk due to daily cycle of preparation and rumination.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or strongly implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""suicide,"" or ""end my life""). The post describes intense distress (""unbearably strong thoughts,"" ""downward spiral"") but frames it as a struggle to cope, not an intent to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""making it through the day is a struggle""), isolation (""keeping this a secret""), and fear of hospitalization. However, these lack explicit suicidal intent.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods, preparations, or imminent actions (e.g., no tools, locations, or timing like ""tonight"").

I know it sounds so stupid to want to die over not having a boyfriend but it's seriously affecting my mental health.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress (loneliness, emptiness, hopelessness) and explicitly states, ""I’ve lost all will to live.""  
   - There are **strong implications of wanting to die** (e.g., ""lost all will to live"") but **no explicit mentions of suicide methods** (e.g., pills, jumping) or **preparations** (e.g., writing a note).  
   - No references to **past attempts** or **imminent actions** (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Focus is on persistent despair due to rejection and isolation, not concrete plans.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Lost all will to live"" strongly implies a desire to cease living.  
   - **Yes**: Emotional context (hopelessness, worthlessness) reinforces suicidal ideation.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Discusses past rejections but **no past suicide attempts** described. Feelings are current/future-oriented.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is a **strong desire to die** (""lost all will to live"") tied to emotional pain, but it lacks plans, methods, or actions. This aligns with **Ideation** (explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).  
   - Rules out:  
     - *Indicator*: Vague distress alone would fit, but ""lost all will to live"" implies suicidal intent.  
     - *Behavior*: No plans/preparations.  
     - *Attempt*: No description of past actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - **Key Elements**:  
     - Explicit mention of death (""what kind of impact will my death have"") and suicide (""when I off myself"").  
     - Strong expressions of suicidal intent: ""I don’t want to live anymore,"" ""I can’t keep living,"" ""I can’t continue to live for decades.""  
     - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, and guilt about impacting the mother.  
     - **No specific methods, plans, preparations, or actions** (e.g., tools, locations, timing like ""tonight"").  
     - **No references to past attempts**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**  
   - **Yes**: ""Off myself"" is an explicit slang reference to suicide.  
   - **Yes**: ""I don’t want to live anymore"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**  
   - **No methods** (e.g., pills, weapons) mentioned.  
   - **No preparations or actions** (e.g., gathering tools).  
   - **No imminent timing** (e.g., ""tonight"")—only vague future intent (""when I off myself"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**  
   - Focuses on **current/future intentions** (""I can’t continue to live"").  
   - **No past attempts** described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**  
   - **Explicit suicidal intent** is present, ruling out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plans, methods, or actions** are described, ruling out *Behavior* and *Attempt*.  
   - Falls under **Ideation**: Strong desire to die with no concrete steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""just killing myself"" is a direct, unambiguous reference to suicide. The statement ""what's the point in not"" strongly implies intent to act on suicidal thoughts.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: High distress, hopelessness (""what's the fucking point""), and despair about financial/health struggles are present but secondary to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, location) or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools) is mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The phrasing (""I'm going to end up..."") indicates future intent, not a past or current action. No reference to prior attempts exists.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""killing myself"") and links it to hopelessness, satisfying the threshold for suicidal ideation.  
   - However, it lacks:  
     - Concrete plans/methods (required for *behavior*).  
     - Descriptions of actions taken (required for *attempt*).  
   - General distress alone would fit *indicator*, but explicit suicidal intent overrules this.

55,"""You look like you're about to die"". Yeah no shit mom, Iam depressed af and tried to kms yesterday, what do you want from me?",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. ""tried to kms yesterday"" uses ""kms"" (common abbreviation for ""kill myself""), explicitly referencing suicide.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method is mentioned, but the phrase describes a past action (""tried"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a past event (""yesterday""). The phrase ""tried to kms"" confirms a concrete action was taken.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Depression (""depressed af"") and distress are present but secondary to the explicit suicide attempt reference.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** (""tried to kms yesterday""), which meets the definition of **Attempt**: a concrete action initiated with suicidal intent, even if incomplete or interrupted.  
   - Rules clarify that mentioning a past attempt overrides current emotional context or vague suicidal language.

I cant live anymore.,1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - ""I cant live anymore"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" strongly implies seeking a method to end life (e.g., ""do this"" contextualized with suffering).  
     - *Verdict*: **Yes** to implied suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**:  
     - Extreme hopelessness (""I absolutely cannot fight anymore""), despair (""non stop pain and suffering for 28 years""), and self-blame (""question if I did something horrific"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**:  
     - ""Non painful way to do this"" references considering methods but lacks specificity (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions). No preparations or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
     - *Verdict*: **No** concrete plan, preparation, or immediacy.  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Focuses on current/future intent (""I cant live anymore"") without references to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **strong suicidal intent** (""I cant live anymore"") and implies a desire to die (""non painful way to do this""), moving beyond vague distress (Indicator).  
   - However, it lacks specifics about plans, methods, preparations, or imminent actions needed for **Behavior**.  
   - No past or ongoing suicide actions are described, ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - **Ideation** fits best: explicit desire to die with implied consideration of methods but no actionable steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrases ""I want to kill myself"" and ""suicide note"" are direct references to suicide. Expressions like ""I want to do it"" (contextually tied to ""kill myself"") and ""write a suicide note"" confirm a strong desire to end life.  
     - *Explicit suicide mentioned*: **Yes**.  
     - *Expressions of wanting to die*: **Yes**.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Specifics include:  
     - Method: ""with drugs.""  
     - Preparations: ""I just have to write a suicide note.""  
     - Imminent intent: ""next week"" establishes a timeframe, and the note-writing is an active step toward enactment.  
   - **Temporal Context**: All statements refer to **future intentions** (""next week""). No past attempts are described.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (vague distress) due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - It surpasses *Ideation* (thoughts without plans) by detailing a method (drugs) and preparation (writing a note).  
   - It does not describe a past action, ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - The combination of **explicit intent + specific method (drugs) + preparation (writing a note)** aligns with **Behavior**, which covers plans/preparations for imminent suicide.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""life is so cyclic,"" ""i'm tired of being sick,"" ""it's so lonely""), despair (""none of the pills do enough,"" ""i have no motivation""), and isolation.
   - **Suicidal Intent**: The phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" implies a desire to end suffering but **lacks explicit terms** like ""suicide,"" ""die,"" or ""kill myself."" It suggests emotional exhaustion rather than a clear wish to die.
   - **Plan/Method**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., buying tools, writing a note), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Past Actions**: No references to prior suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.
   - **Key Ambiguity**: ""Get this over with"" could contextually imply ending life but is vague and not strongly coupled with suicidal language (e.g., ""I want to die""). It aligns more broadly with escaping distress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit terms (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""die"")? **No**.  
   - Strongly implied desire to die? **Unclear**—""get this over with"" is indirect and lacks concrete suicidal intent. Severe distress alone is insufficient for ""ideation.""  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method? **No**.  
   - Preparations/actions? **No**.  
   - Imminent intent? **No**—""soon"" is non-specific and not tied to action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current struggles**, not past attempts or future plans.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness and weariness but **lacks explicit/strong suicidal intent, plans, or behaviors**. The phrase ""get this over with"" is ambiguous and, without clearer suicidal language, falls under general distress.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Vague references to ending suffering without actionable intent, plans, or self-harm.

I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""I have overdosed"" directly describes a self-harm action. While the post states ""I don't want to die,"" the act of overdosing (even with non-lethal intent) implies suicidal behavior for self-punishment (""it'll punish me""). Strong emotional distress (regret, suffering, self-blame) is present.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: A specific method is disclosed (""I took 500mg Zoloft""). The action has already been taken (""I finally went through""), and physical symptoms are actively occurring (""I’m getting a headache"").
   - **Temporal Context**: The overdose is described as a recent event (""It hasn’t been that long""), with current physical consequences. This is not a past attempt but an ongoing behavioral outcome.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes a **concrete action taken** (overdosing) with suicidal intent (to ""punish"" oneself), aligning with the **Behavior** category. The admission of non-lethal intent (""it won’t kill me"") does not negate the suicidal nature of the act, as the definition of ""Behavior"" includes actions with self-harm intent, regardless of lethality. References to active symptoms confirm the behavior is immediate/recent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. ""I'm doing it in the near future"" and ""ready to go"" strongly imply suicidal intent (ending life). ""I feel so at peace... knowing I'm going to"" reinforces intent without explicit terminology.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Resignation (""ready to go""), calmness (""at peace""), and closure (spending time with a favorite person) suggest resolve.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, location) is mentioned. However, ""in the near future"" indicates imminent intent, and preparatory actions are implied (resolving relationships).
   - **Temporal Context**: Future-oriented (""near future,"" ""going to,"" ""ready to go""). No past attempts described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Strongly implied intent (e.g., ""doing it,"" ""ready to go"") → **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No explicit method, but imminent timing (""near future"") + preparatory behavior (closure with loved one) → **Leans toward behavior**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Future intent → **Not past attempt**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **strong suicidal intent** (""doing it,"" ""ready to go"") with **imminent timing** (""near future"") and **preparatory actions** (emotional closure).  
   - This fits **Behavior** (suicidal intent + imminent timing/preparations), even without a specific method.  
   - *Not Ideation*: Strong intent + timing pushes beyond passive thoughts.  
   - *Not Attempt*: No description of past/initiated actions.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Explicit intent moves beyond vague distress.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""i was suicidal,"" confirming past suicidal thoughts. No current expressions of desire to die or imminent intent are present.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Frustration and distress about past institutional handling, but no current expressions of hopelessness or despair implying active suicidal intent.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of specific methods, preparations, or actions. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal thoughts are explicitly framed in the past (""it was 4 yrs ago""). No reference to current/future intent or actions. No description of past attempts—only ideation is mentioned.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core of the post is a retrospective account of past suicidal thoughts (""i was suicidal""), which aligns with **Ideation** (explicit suicidal feelings without plans/actions). 
   - It lacks current intent, specific plans, preparations, or descriptions of actions taken (ruling out **Behavior** and **Attempt**). General frustration alone is insufficient for **Indicator**, as suicidal intent is explicitly stated (though past-tense).

   - **References to Past Attempts**: None. The post focuses on current thoughts and emotions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""i should die"" and ""kill myself,"" showing direct expressions of wanting to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I am just rubbish""), despair (""I hate my family""), shame (""sucking at everything""), and isolation (""I have no friends"").
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: Explicitly stated: ""I have prepared everything."" This confirms concrete steps toward suicide.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a recent decision (""a few days ago"") and current readiness (""prepared everything""), indicating imminent intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""i should die"").  
   - Clear desire to die expressed.  
   **→ Yes/Yes.**

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is named, but ""prepared everything"" signals tangible actions or preparations.  
   - Imminent intent is implied by recency (""a few days ago"") and readiness.  
   **→ Leans toward 'behavior' due to preparations.**

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post includes strong implications of wanting to die (""vanish without a trace,"" ""no one will find my body""). Specific methods are named (using a ""pistol"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: The user details a concrete plan: emptying their bank account, leaving belongings, walking to a secluded spot, and carrying a pistol. Preparations are explicit (e.g., ""Only things I plan to have on me... a pistol"").
   - **Temporal Context**: The plan is future-oriented (""When that happens...""), but the specificity of the method (firearm) and preparations (disposing of belongings) indicate imminent intent once triggered.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""nothing to look forward to"") and perceived rejection (""they never seemed to enjoy my company"") reinforce intent but are secondary to the explicit plan.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond passive ideation by outlining a method (firearm), location (""secluded spot""), and preparatory actions (disposing of assets). This aligns with **Behavior**, defined as suicidal intent coupled with specific plans/preparations. The absence of a past attempt rules out ""Attempt,"" while the concrete steps elevate it beyond ""Ideation.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post directly states, ""I want to die,"" which is an explicit expression of suicidal intent. Phrases like ""I give up now"" and ""life is shit"" reinforce hopelessness but do not dilute the explicit suicidal desire.

Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct statements like ""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years"" and ""when i do do it"" (referring to suicide). Strong implications include ""making it easier to do something"" and discussing self-harm history.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (e.g., ""rotting away in my flat,"" ""disconected,"" ""dark depressive state""), hopelessness (""no one cares,"" ""long term fix""), and isolation.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific plans are described: choosing a woodland location, leaving notes for dog walkers to alert police, and avoiding home to delay discovery. The method (e.g., ""got a rope"") is indirectly referenced but not acquired. Imminent timing is implied (""on the edge... a tragedy away"").
   - **Past Attempts**: No. Childhood self-harm (scratching/punching) is mentioned, but no suicide attempts are described. The psychologist’s advice (""whenever I put a plan into an action"") is hypothetical, not an actual attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal"") and strongly implied (""do it""). Emotional context confirms intent beyond vague distress.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific preparations are confirmed: location (woodland), actions (leaving notes), and logistical planning (avoiding home). This shows concrete steps toward acting on suicidal thoughts, despite no immediate tools (e.g., rope not yet acquired). Imminent risk (""edge"") elevates this beyond ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Suicidal ideation is chronic (10 years), but plans (woodland, notes) are recent/current. No past suicide attempts are indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Ideation**: Excluded due to specific plans/preparations.  
   - **Behavior**: Fits best. The post includes explicit suicidal intent (""suicidal for 10 years"") coupled with actionable preparations (location, notes, logistics). This aligns with the definition: ""specific plan or method"" and ""preparations or actions taken"" without a completed attempt.  
   - **Attempt**: Excluded; no description of past/initiated suicidal actions.

I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post includes direct expressions like ""I hate my life, I wanna off myself"" and ""I don’t even wanna live anymore."" These are explicit declarations of suicidal intent (Yes).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong emotions of anger (""selfish as a bitch""), hopelessness (""I got everything taken away""), and despair (""I’m so sick and tired"") are present, reinforcing distress.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions taken are mentioned. The phrase ""wanna off myself"" implies desire but lacks concrete steps or timing (No).
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal expressions (""wanna off myself,"" ""don’t wanna live"") reflect current/future intent. No references to past attempts or actions exist.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""off myself"") and strongly implied (""don’t wanna live anymore""). Emotional context confirms intent (Yes).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are indicated (No).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - All suicidal references are about present/future feelings. No past attempts described (No).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal desire (""off myself,"" ""don’t wanna live"") but lacks plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions. This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as suicidal thoughts without concrete steps. Emotional distress alone (e.g., anger at mother) is insufficient for ""Indicator,"" and the absence of plans/actions rules out ""Behavior"" or ""Attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The user explicitly states ""suicidal"" and strongly implies intent with ""tonight's the night I guess."" Phrases like ""help me stay alive"" and ""no one will miss me when I'm gone"" reinforce a desire to end life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""feeling kinda hopeless""), desperation (""desperate to get help""), and isolation (""no one cares,"" ""no one to talk to"").  
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned. However, ""tonight's the night"" indicates **imminent intent** (temporal urgency).  
   - **Past Attempts**: None described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Direct reference to being ""suicidal"" and implied intent (""tonight's the night"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No method or preparation described, but **imminent timing** (""tonight"") signals strong intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future intent** (""tonight""), not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - It surpasses *Ideation* because imminent timing (""tonight"") implies concrete intent, moving it toward action.  
   - *Attempt* is excluded as no past/current action is described.  
   - **Behavior** fits: Strong suicidal intent with imminent timing (even without a method), aligning with the definition.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. ""Cutting an artery"" is a direct reference to a lethal self-harm method, implying intent to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Distress/isolation (""I don’t know who else to ask""), but the focus is on method planning.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are named (""oxy"" and ""cutting an artery""), with a practical question about pain reduction, indicating active planning.
   - **Temporal Context**: Future-oriented (""wouldn’t taking oxy lessen the pain""). No mention of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied via method-focused language (""cutting an artery"" → fatal outcome).  
   - Expressions of wanting to die are inferred from the context (seeking pain mitigation for a lethal act).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods are named (""oxy"" for sedation, ""cutting an artery"" for blood loss).  
   - Question about efficacy (""lessen the pain"") signals active preparation, not just abstract thought.  
   - Imminent intent is implied through urgency (""who else to ask"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - No past attempts described. Language centers on future intent (""wouldn’t taking..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post moves beyond passive thoughts (Ideation) by detailing methods and planning.  
   - Fits **Behavior**: Explicit suicidal intent combined with specific methods and implied preparation (optimizing pain management for the act).  
   - Does not describe a completed/in-progress action (Attempt) or vague distress without suicidal intent (Indicator).

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument.

   - Emotional context includes distress over the relationship (e.g., ""Her words have really hurt me,"" ""I can barely speak to her"") and feelings of being misunderstood due to mental illness (BPD/CPTSD).  
   - No references to personal death wishes, methods, preparations, past attempts, or imminent intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is mentioned only in the context of the **friend's statement** (""kill myself,"" ""commit suicide"").  
   - **The user themselves expresses no direct/implied desire to die**, end their life, or engage in self-harm.  
   - **Verdict**: No (for the user's own intent).

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""i feel like a failure who might as well die""), despair (""i hate them and my parents""), and isolation (""i dont have money, a license, friends, nothing"") are present.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) are mentioned. The phrase ""one day"" implies non-imminent intent, and vague ideas like ""run away to a forest"" lack concrete planning.
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal intent is future-oriented (""one day"") with no references to past attempts or actions taken.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct expressions like ""kill myself,"" ""end it all,"" ""prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself,"" and repeated wishes for death (e.g., ""hoping to be murdered,"" ""pray for some random person to murder me""). These are explicit statements of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""life is so sisyphean,"" ""losing more hope""), shame (""defective and unfit to be alive""), isolation (""how alone I am""), and hopelessness (""terminal illness no one recognizes"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. The user expresses a passive wish for death via external means (murder or assisted suicide) but describes no personal plans, methods, preparations, or actions (e.g., no tools, locations, or steps taken). Phrases like ""walk through sketchy areas"" reflect a hope for external intervention, not a self-initiated plan.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future desires (""every day,"" ""pray for some random person to murder me""). No references to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"") and strongly implied through intense death wishes. Emotional context confirms severe distress with clear intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods or preparations are described. The reliance on murder/assisted suicide is hypothetical and externally dependent, not self-directed. No imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") for personal action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Concerns ongoing/future ideation. No past attempts mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post falls under **Ideation** because:  
     - It expresses explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself,"" ""end it all"") and intense death wishes.  
     - There is no evidence of a concrete plan, method, preparation, or action (required for *Behavior*).  
     - Passive reliance on external factors (murder/assisted suicide) does not constitute a personal plan.  
     - No past attempt is described (which would trigger *Attempt*).  
     - While distress is severe, the absence of actionable steps or imminent intent keeps it within *Ideation*.

   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I always felt unwanted""), despair (""8,000 fucking days of this shithole""), and exhaustion (""I can’t take no more"").  
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations (e.g., tools, locations, actions).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Strongly implied desire to die (e.g., ""I’m going to die,"" ""I’m going to leave""). Farewell phrasing (""See you all on the other side"") reinforces intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post includes strong implications of suicidal thoughts but no direct terms (e.g., ""suicide""). Key phrases: ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""wave the white flag"" (implying surrender to death), and ""My soul is hurting, I don’t think I can do it anymore."" These express a desire to cease existing.  
     - *Explicit/Implied*: **Yes** (strongly implied desire to die).  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""happiness... out of my reach for beyond a decade""), despair (""tired of being a burden""), and isolation (""no one is here for me"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions taken. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: References past struggles (e.g., failed medications, coping attempts) but **no past suicide attempts**. Focus is on current/future intent (""starting to want to wave the white flag"").  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator?** No. While there is distress and hopelessness, the implied desire to die (""don’t wanna be here,"" ""wave the white flag"") exceeds vague references.  
   - **Behavior/Attempt?** No. Absence of plans, methods, preparations, or descriptions of past actions.  
   - **Ideation?** Yes. Strongly implied suicidal intent (""don’t wanna be here,"" ""can’t do it anymore"") without concrete plans or actions aligns with passive to active ideation.

I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago, he lost his mother to cancer, got bullied, got kicked out of school because of a false accusation which stated that he was planning a rebellion and how they were making a very small amount of money. The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life. I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother, so he could live the life he deserves. I don't deserve, nor want to live. But he does. I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The user states, ""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" which is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. This strongly implies suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness and worthlessness are evident (e.g., ""I don’t deserve... to live"").  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or actions are mentioned. The metaphorical wish to ""donate my life"" does not indicate a concrete plan or imminent intent.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal ideation is expressed in the present tense (""I don’t want to live""), with no reference to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**  
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire not to live, meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt, ruling out **Behavior** and **Attempt**.  
   - While severe hopelessness is present, the explicit statement of not wanting to live moves this beyond **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon"" are strong expressions of a desire to end life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""healing is a fucking joke"") and despair.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Stopping antidepressants, anti-anxiety, and blood pressure medications is an active preparation to hasten death. The line ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" and ""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid"" imply passive methods, reinforcing intent.
   - **Temporal Context**: Current/future intent (""I'm stopping all my meds today,"" ""Hope it all ends soon""). No past attempts described.
   - **Key Risk Factors**: Concrete actions (discontinuing medication, quitting therapy) paired with explicit suicidal desire.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond passive thoughts (Ideation) by detailing active preparations (stopping medications) to facilitate death. This aligns with the **Behavior** category: suicidal intent + specific actions/preparations, even without a traditional ""plan"" like acquiring tools. The immediacy (""today"") and method-like actions (medication cessation) elevate it from Ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""I just want to disappear"" and ""free from all this pain"" strongly imply a desire to escape life/end suffering, leaning toward suicidal ideation.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe despair (""broken remainings of my soul,"" ""pain"") and hopelessness reinforce intent to cease existence.  
   - **Plan or Method**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Past Attempts**: No references to prior actions or attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strongly implied desire to end suffering/escape life (via ""disappear"" and ""free from pain"") aligns with **ideation**.  
   - Lacks plans, methods, or actions required for ""behavior"" or ""attempt.""  
   - Emotional distress exceeds ""indicator"" due to clear intent to stop existing.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes (""kill myself,"" ""plan for suicide"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Distress is present but secondary to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Explicitly states seeking a plan (""I just need a plan for suicide""), indicating active preparation.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intent (""need a plan""), with no reference to past actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"") and **actively seeks a plan**, moving beyond passive thoughts. This aligns with the **Behavior** category (suicidal intent + preparation/planning).  
   - No specific method is named, but seeking a plan qualifies as preparatory behavior.  
   - Not an attempt (no past/current action described) or ideation (planning elevates it beyond thoughts alone).

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong expressions of distress, loss of control, and self-deprecation (e.g., ""am I crazy?"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Simulated actions are described (e.g., ""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out""), but these are metaphorical, not concrete plans.  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: Explicit mention of a ""most recent failed attempt"" (""I wish I stayed in the car"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""hurt myself really badly""). **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned for future intent. The finger-gun gesture is a symbolic action, not a plan. **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to a past event: ""my most recent failed attempt."" This confirms a concrete action was taken with suicidal intent.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The **core determinant** is the clear description of a past suicide attempt (""failed attempt"").  
   - Rules specify: ""If the post describes a past suicide attempt [...] classify as 'attempt'.""  
   - Current ideation (""I'm going to kill myself"") and behavioral simulations (finger-gun gesture) are present but secondary to the explicit acknowledgment of a prior attempt.

People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them.

The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains explicit statements: ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal."" These are direct expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair, hopelessness, anger, and distress are present (e.g., ""I hate my life,"" ""I’ve lost all my sanity""). However, these emotions support but do not override the explicit suicidal language.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) are mentioned. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: None. The post describes past abuse and bullying but no suicide attempts (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried to..."").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal"") and strongly implied (""do not want to live anymore""). The emotional context (anger, despair) reinforces suicidal intent, pushing this beyond vague distress.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent are described. The focus is on feelings, not actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The suicidal statements reflect current/future intentions (""I’m angry and suicidal,"" ""do not want to live""). Past experiences (abuse, bullying) are noted, but no past suicide attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses clear suicidal intent (e.g., ""suicidal,"" ""do not want to live"") but lacks specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts. This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete steps or actions. The emotional distress supports this but does not elevate it to Behavior or Attempt.

   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) are mentioned. The phrase ""kill myself **now**"" implies immediacy but lacks concrete actionable steps.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal desire (""now"") reflects a current/future intention. No reference to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**, suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"").  
   - **Yes**, there is a direct expression of wanting to die (""I’d rather kill myself now"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""I want to kill myself,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out,"" and ""thoughts of how it would feel to die."" These are direct expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""every single day I still have the urge""), fear (""I'm scared""), guilt (""I don’t want to leave my cats/friends""), and isolation (""say something to people who might care"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: The method ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger"" implies firearms. However, no evidence of preparation (e.g., accessing a gun) or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight""). The user explicitly states inability to act: ""I can never bring myself to actually do it.""
   - **Temporal Context**: Describes recurring urges (""every single day"") and current thoughts (""I lay in bed at night""), but no past attempts or actions taken.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrases ""kill me,"" ""murder me,"" and ""end my horrible life"" are direct expressions of wanting to die. The post explicitly communicates a desire for death.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair and hopelessness are present (e.g., ""horrible life,"" ""beg of you""), reinforcing suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: The method mentioned (""murder me"") involves another person acting on the user. However, the user does not describe a *personal* plan, preparation, or action (e.g., self-initiated methods like pills or self-harm). The plea for someone else to ""come here"" implies intent but lacks concrete, self-directed steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post reflects a current/future desire (""please come here"") with no reference to past attempts or actions taken by the user.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct expressions like ""kill me"" and ""end my horrible life"" leave no ambiguity about suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific personal method or preparation**. While the user references ""murder"" and offers an address, this relies on external intervention. No self-directed tools, locations, or actions (e.g., ""I bought pills"") are described. Imminent intent (""come here"") is present but lacks a clear *personal* plan, leaning toward ideation over behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intent (""please come here"") with no mention of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal desire** (""kill me,"" ""end my life"") but lacks evidence of a personal plan, preparation, or self-initiated action. The appeal to a third party does not constitute a concrete step under the ""behavior"" criteria. It aligns with **Ideation** (strong desire to die without actionable steps).

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct references to suicide, self-harm, or phrases like ""I want to die."" The closest statement is ""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore,"" which implies emotional exhaustion but lacks explicit or strong implication of suicidal intent. The user explicitly denies intent: ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen.""
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong themes of hopelessness (""I don't see a way out""), dread, isolation, and worthlessness (e.g., ""I deserve it,"" ""everything I've done has been wrong""). However, distress alone is insufficient for higher categories without suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). The phrase ""I haven’t been afraid of dying"" is passive and non-actionable.
   - **Past Attempts**: No references to prior suicide attempts or self-injurious actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Suicide Explicitly Mentioned/Implied?** No.  
   - **Expressions of Wanting to Die?** No. The statement ""things would be better if I didn’t have to try anymore"" suggests escapism or resignation, not active desire to die.

   - **Specific Methods?** No.  
   - **Preparations/Actions?** No.  
   - **Imminent Intent?** No.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current distress and past life events (e.g., job struggles, upbringing). No references to past/ongoing suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and passive resignation (e.g., ""I don’t see a way out""). However, it lacks **explicit/strong suicidal intent**, **specific plans**, or **actions** required for Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt. The denial of deliberate self-harm (""I don’t think I’m gonna deliberately make it happen"") further supports this.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" and ""i still thought about suicide."" This confirms direct expressions of suicidal ideation.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. While suicidal thoughts are described as intensifying, no specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal thoughts are described as recurring (""even for the majority of the time i felt ok i still thought about suicide"") and current. There are no references to past attempts or actions taken.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""i can't keep getting false hope"") and despair (""crushed and empty"") are present, but these alone do not override the need for explicit suicidal intent or behavior.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post explicitly describes ongoing suicidal thoughts but lacks any specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past/current actions. This aligns with the **Ideation** category (suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).  
   - Rules applied:  
     - Explicit suicidal intent is confirmed (""suicidal thoughts"").  
     - No evidence of behavior (plans/preparations) or attempts (past actions).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Direct statements (""kill myself"") and desire to die are unambiguous.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Ideation**: Excluded. While ideation covers explicit suicidal thoughts, the imminent plan (""tonight"") pushes this to 'behavior'.

   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned and strongly implied (e.g., ""practicing hanging myself,"" ""I will succeed"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it"").  
   → **Conclusion**: Strong evidence for suicidal intent beyond vague distress.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Hanging.  
   - Actions taken: Repeated practice to overcome survival instinct.  
   - Imminent intent: Urgency in language (""can't wait,"" ""will be over soon"").  
   → **Conclusion**: Moves beyond ideation into actionable behavior.

   - Refers to ongoing/future actions (""practicing,"" ""going to keep practicing"").  
   - No past attempt described (only preparation).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent and method.  
   - **Ideation**: Ruled out—specific method and active preparations exceed passive thoughts.  
   - **Behavior**: Fits best. The post details suicidal intent, a concrete method (hanging), and ongoing preparatory actions (practicing to overcome instinct).

My family always says its because she sees me as 'weak' because i was scared of dogs when we first got her. That makes me feel like absolute shit and its all i can think of every time this happens. Tonight it happened twice. the first time i screamed at her to shut up and the second time i screamed i would kill her and whipped a blanket at her. My mom was there and she said i scared her. I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about. I dont want to get into any relationships (not that i would anyway) because i can snap like this.

I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""I want to die"" (direct expression of wanting to die) and ""one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone"" (strong implication of ending life).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I feel like one day i will hurt someone""), shame (""I know i'm a piece of shit""), and despair (""I am on the edge"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools) is mentioned. The phrase ""take myself away"" is vague and non-specific. Imminent intent (""if not tonight"") is present but lacks concrete actions or plans.
   - **Temporal Context**: All suicidal references are future-oriented (""one day i will take myself away""). No past attempts or actions are described.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Excluded because suicidal intent is explicit (""I want to die"").
   - **Behavior**: Excluded due to absence of specific methods, preparations, or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"" is conditional and unsupported by concrete steps).
   - **Attempt**: Excluded—no description of past/initiated self-harm.
   - **Ideation**: Best fit. The post expresses active suicidal desire (""I want to die"") and future intent (""take myself away""), but lacks plans, methods, or behaviors. Urgency (""if not tonight"") leans toward ideation without crossing into behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post includes phrases like ""I just don't want to exist,"" which implies a passive desire to cease living. However, the user explicitly denies suicidal intent (""Im not suicidal or something"") and labels suicide as ""selfish."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't have any purpose""), shame (""I feel like disapointment""), and anxiety.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The distress is described as ongoing (""for almost a week"") and rooted in past events (lockdown, academic stress). No references to past suicide attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses severe distress and vague references to not wanting to exist but lacks **explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent** due to the direct denial (""not suicidal"").  
   - Emotional suffering (hopelessness, purposelessness) and passive wishes (""don't want to exist"") align with **Indicator**, as they stop short of expressing a desire to die or act.  
   - No plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts are present, ruling out **Ideation** (requires explicit/intent), **Behavior** (requires plans/actions), or **Attempt** (requires past actions).

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Multiple direct statements: ""I don't know what I truly want besides death,"" ""I want to take my life,"" ""the thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating,"" and ""I attempted suicide last week.""
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness""), worthlessness (""useless... no use to society""), and despair.
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: No active plans or imminent intent for future actions. However, a **past attempt** is explicitly described: ""I attempted suicide last week... my attempt had failed.""
   - **Temporal Context**: Direct reference to a past suicide attempt (""last week""), including details about drafting a note and the act itself. Current feelings of ideation are present but are secondary to the disclosed past action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. Direct expressions of wanting to die and a stated past attempt.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   No future plans/methods, but a **past attempt** is confirmed (action taken with suicidal intent).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   Past attempt clearly described (""last week""), with outcomes noted (failure, aftermath).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes suicidal ideation (e.g., ""I want to take my life"") but **explicitly describes a past suicide attempt** (""I attempted suicide last week... failed"").  
   - Per the rules: ""If the post describes a past suicide attempt... classify as 'attempt'."" This overrides concurrent ideation.  
   - Fits the **Attempt** definition: A concrete past action with suicidal intent (even if incomplete/failed).

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct references to suicide (""suicide attempts,"" ""suicide note,"" ""swallowed every single [pill]"") and strong expressions of not wanting to live (""I don’t want to live at all"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""I don’t want to live at all"") and confusion/scariness about surviving (""it’s like I just don’t die"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific methods are described (e.g., overdosing on pills, cutting neck with a razor, prescription drug cocktail). Preparations/actions are explicit (e.g., buying pills, writing a note, using tools).  
   - **Temporal Context**: All suicidal actions are **past events** (e.g., attempts at ages 16 and in November 2020). The motorcycle incident is framed as accidental, not suicidal.  
   - **Explicit Suicide/Intent**: Strongly present (e.g., ""Some of these are suicide attempts"").  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No. Explicit suicidal intent and past actions go beyond vague distress.  
   - **Ideation?** No. While current hopelessness exists, the post focuses on **past actions**, not just thoughts.  
   - **Behavior?** No. No *current/imminent* plans or preparations are described.  
   - **Attempt?** **Yes**. The core of the post details **multiple past suicide attempts** with methods (pills, cutting, drug cocktail), including incomplete/self-interrupted actions (e.g., lying to avoid treatment, surviving despite intent). The definitions specify that describing past attempts—even if survived—falls under ""Attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct, explicit mention of suicide. The statement ""too tired of life"" implies strong despair but is contextualized by the explicit suicidal language.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned. The user references fear of consequences (""suicide is illegal here... might get arrested"") but describes no actions, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: All statements reflect current feelings (""too scared,"" ""tired of life"") or hypothetical future outcomes (""if I fail""). No references to past attempts or actions taken.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""too tired of life"") and fear (""scared,"" ""too scared to kill myself"") are present, but these support the explicit suicidal intent rather than diluting it.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**, suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"").  
   - **Yes**, there is a direct expression of wanting to die (""too tired of life"" in context).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** methods, preparations, or imminent timing are indicated. Fear of failure/consequences is a deterrent, not a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future** thoughts without past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post contains **explicit suicidal intent** (""kill myself"") but lacks any specific plan, preparation, or reference to past/ongoing actions. The fear of acting (""too scared"") reinforces that this is **ideation without progression to behavior**.  
   - **Rules Applied**:  
     - Suicidal intent is tied to the author, not others.  
     - ""Indicator"" is ruled out due to explicit suicidal language.  
     - ""Behavior"" requires a plan/preparation/imminent intent—none exist.  
     - ""Attempt"" requires description of past actions—not present.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post does not use direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but phrases like *""end this bullshit for good""* and *""This will be my second to last post""* strongly imply a desire to end one’s life. The context of despair (""*human life has no fucking purpose*"") reinforces this intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Extreme hopelessness (""*We are rotting away*""), anger (""*Fuck this fucking world*""), and existential despair (""*living as a slave*"") are present.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: The post explicitly references a plan: *""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good.""* The trip’s purpose (ending life) and the timeframe (""*April*"") indicate preparation and imminent intent.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The plan is future-oriented (""*in April*""), and there are no references to past attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post moves beyond **Indicator** (vague distress) due to strong implied intent to die.  
   - It exceeds **Ideation** (thoughts without plans) because of the specific plan (trip in April) and action-oriented language (""*taking a trip to end this*"").  
   - It does not describe a **past Attempt** (e.g., ""I tried last week"").  
   - **Behavior** is the best fit: The post expresses suicidal intent (""*end this bullshit for good*"") combined with a clear plan (""*trip in April*"") and preparatory action (""*taking a trip*"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but strong implications of wanting to die (e.g., ""wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds""). Emotional context shows severe despair and isolation.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific methods mentioned (e.g., overdose, being hit by a car), but no evidence of preparation, actions taken, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Describes current emotional state and wishes (""I just wish...""), not past attempts or actions.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""no one left to turn to""), worthlessness (""fucked myself over""), and emotional numbness (""I don’t feel like anything"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Strongly implied desire to die** (Yes): Wishes for lethal harm (e.g., ""od on meds"") indicate intent to end life.  
   - **Severe distress with implied intent** (Yes): Supports ideation over indicator.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Methods mentioned** (Yes): Overdosing (""od on meds"") and fatal accidents (""hit by a car"").  
   - **Preparation/actions taken** (No): No evidence of gathering tools, writing notes, or acting.  
   - **Imminent intent** (No): No time-bound language (e.g., ""tonight"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future** desires (""I just wish""), not past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **strong suicidal intent** via implied methods but lacks actionable steps (preparation/imminence). This aligns with **Ideation** (explicit desires without concrete plans/actions).  
   - *Why not Behavior?*: No evidence of preparation, imminent intent, or initiation of a plan.  
   - *Why not Attempt?*: No description of past actions taken to harm oneself.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or implied references to suicide, self-harm, or a desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end it all""). The phrase ""jump out of bed"" is metaphorical (expressing hypothetical enthusiasm if attractive), not literal.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, envy, and perceived lifelong suffering due to appearance. However, these focus on external circumstances (ugliness) rather than internal suicidal intent.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: References past/present suffering but **no description of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions**. Hypothetical statements (""I would jump out of bed"") are aspirational, not actionable.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: The post expresses severe distress, anger, and hopelessness linked to appearance-based suffering. However, it lacks explicit/implied suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions. Vague references to suffering (e.g., ""daily torture"") do not meet thresholds for ideation/behavior without suicidal intent.
   - **Ideation/Behavior/Attempt Ruled Out**: No suicidal desire, plans, methods, or descriptions of past/current self-harm actions. Metaphorical language (""jump out of bed"") is contextualized as envy, not self-harm.

   - **References to Past Attempts**: Clear evidence of past suicide attempts (""tried to kill myself 8 times"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal,"" ""kill myself"") → **Yes**.  
   - Expressions of wanting to die are explicit → **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific *current* methods, preparations, or imminent timing mentioned → **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References to past suicide attempts (""I've tried..."") are explicit and concrete → **Past events dominate the post**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post confirms **past suicide attempts** (""tried to kill myself 8 times""), which meets the definition of **Attempt** (incomplete or interrupted actions with suicidal intent).  
   - Although current suicidal ideation is implied (""me being suicidal""), the clear description of past attempts overrides other categories per the rules.  
   - Rules reminder: ""If the post mentions a past attempt, classify as 'attempt' even with current ideation.""

103,bruh. they always say if something/someone makes you sad then you're better off without them right? but when i say i'm better off dead everyone's like no don't do that :D,0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""i'm better off dead"" strongly implies a desire not to be alive. While not using words like ""suicide,"" it directly expresses a wish for death. The emotional context (frustration, irony) reinforces intent.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post discusses a recurring thought (""when I say..."") rather than a past attempt or immediate plan.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core message (""better off dead"") fits **Ideation**: It explicitly expresses a desire to die but lacks plans, actions, or references to past attempts. The sarcastic tone doesn’t negate the suicidal intent implied in the statement.  
   - *Why not other categories?*  
     - **Indicator**: Vague distress alone (e.g., ""life isn’t worth living"") would apply here, but ""better off dead"" is a clear expression of suicidal desire.  
     - **Behavior/Attempt**: No evidence of plans, actions, or past attempts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""i took 44 paracetamol"" directly implies a suicide-related action (overdose). The context (""i dont think i want to die but something is stopping me"") shows ambivalence but does not negate the suicidal intent behind the act.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Present (e.g., ""I feel like a burden,"" guilt over self-harm).
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific method (44 paracetamol overdose) and actions taken (consumption confirmed). Physical symptoms (stomach pain, sweating, shaking) corroborate the action.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a recent action (""almost an hour ago""), indicating current/imminent risk. No mention of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied via the overdose action, even with stated ambivalence. Physical distress confirms the behavior occurred.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (paracetamol overdose) and preparation/action (consumption) are explicit. Imminent risk is evident due to recent timing and acute symptoms.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes a current behavior (overdose occurred ~1 hour prior), not a past attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded—explicit suicidal action (overdose) exists.  
   - **Ideation**: Excluded—specific method and action taken go beyond thoughts.  
   - **Attempt**: Excluded—no description of a *completed* past act (e.g., ""I tried but survived""). The post describes an *ongoing* crisis.  
   - **Behavior**: Best fit—details a specific method (paracetamol), preparation/action (ingestion), and imminent risk (""almost an hour ago,"" active symptoms).

   - No emotional descriptors (e.g., hopelessness) are present, but the intent is clear.  
   - No methods, plans, preparations, or timelines are mentioned (explicitly states ""no idea how, when or anything else"").  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - ""End it"" strongly implies suicidal intent (equivalent to ""I want to die"").  
   - **Answer**: Yes.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method, preparation, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated. The user explicitly denies having a plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""completely hopeless""), exhaustion (""I'm exhausted""), emotional numbness (""I feel nothing""), and perceived lack of support (""no one realizes how bad I am"").
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or implied references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or ending life (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""end it all,"" or similar). Emotional distress is present but lacks suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current emotional state and cyclical struggles; no references to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide not explicitly/strongly implied (No).  
   - No expressions of wanting to die (No).  
   - Severe distress without suicidal intent → leans toward **indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses a bipolar diagnosis, therapy, past struggles (depression, breakdowns, near-abusive behavior), and current improvement (""been way better tho"").  
   - Emotional indicators include loneliness, fear of becoming manipulative, and references to past ""rock bottom"" (depression, breakdowns).  
   - **Death/suicide mentions**: The phrase ""there's nothing lower but death"" is contextualized as a general observation about hitting rock bottom, not a personal desire. No explicit terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or strong implications of wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone"").  
   - **Plan/method**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., tools, timing like ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal context**: All distress references (""puking everyday,"" ""mental breakdowns"") are past events (2+ years ago), with current emphasis on recovery.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**. Death is mentioned abstractly (""nothing lower but death"") as part of a motivational statement, not as personal intent. No expressions of wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No methods, preparations, or imminent timing.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - All severe struggles (depression, breakdowns) are explicitly in the past (""2 years ago""), contrasted with current improvement.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress (loneliness, fear) and references past suffering but lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent, plans, or actions.  
   - The mention of ""death"" is generalized advice (""everyone has to hit rock bottom..."") and not self-directed.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Vague references to hardship without suicidal ideation/behavior; focus on coping and recovery.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""plan on ending it soon"" and ""i dont know what else to do"" strongly imply suicidal intent and a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Present (e.g., guilt, overwhelm, fear of pain).
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific method mentioned (""overdosing on ibuprofen"") and tentative timing (""tonight or this week"").
   - **Preparations/Actions**: No explicit actions taken (e.g., no note-writing or acquiring tools). The post focuses on plans and considerations.
   - **Past Attempts**: None referenced.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. ""Ending it soon"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent, and the context confirms a desire to die.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   Yes. A specific method (ibuprofen overdose) is identified as the ""go-to plan,"" and timing is considered (""tonight or this week""). This indicates preparation and intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   Refers to future intentions (""tonight or this week""). No past attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - It surpasses **Ideation** because a specific method and timing are mentioned, moving into actionable planning.  
   - **Behavior** fits best: Suicidal intent is explicit, a method is specified (""ibuprofen""), and imminent timing is considered (""tonight"").  
   - **Attempt** is inapplicable as no concrete past/current action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit suicide mention: ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"" is a direct statement of suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I feel like shit,"" ""some people are born/meant to be fucked up"").
   - Plan/method: A specific method (using a gun) is mentioned, but conditionally (""If I had a gun""). No evidence of preparation, access to tools, or actions taken.
   - Temporal context: Refers to current/future intent (""right now,"" ""in the future""). No mention of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. The phrase ""I'd kill myself"" is an explicit declaration of suicidal desire.  
   - **Yes**. ""I'd kill myself"" directly expresses wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Method mentioned**: Yes (""gun""), but hypothetical (conditional on access).  
   - **Preparations/actions**: No evidence (e.g., no mention of owning a gun, writing a note, or setting a timeline).  
   - **Imminent intent**: No (lacks timing cues like ""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future ideation (""right now,"" ""in the future""). No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal intent (""kill myself"") with a method (gun), but the method is conditional and lacks preparation/imminent action. This aligns with **Ideation** (explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).  
   - Does not meet **Behavior** criteria (no plan enactment, preparation, or imminent intent) or **Attempt** (no past/current action). General distress alone is insufficient for **Indicator** due to explicit suicidal intent.

   - It does not describe a specific plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent, ruling out **Behavior**.
   - No past or current suicide attempt is mentioned, ruling out **Attempt**.

I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help.

Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues.

I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The user explicitly references ""suicidal thoughts"" and confirms they are currently recurring (""I've begun having those thoughts again""). They also mention a past suicide attempt.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (e.g., chronic pain causing helplessness, guilt about seeking help) and shame (""I feel like a piece of crap"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific current methods, plans, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The focus is on thoughts and past events.
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicide attempt is explicitly stated as historical (""many years ago""). Current suicidal ideation is described as recurring thoughts without actionable steps.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is explicitly stated via ""suicidal thoughts"" and acknowledged recurrence. **Yes**.  
   - Expressions of wanting to die are implied through the resurgence of suicidal thoughts. **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""doing it now"") are described. The post emphasizes seeking help and emotional struggles. **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past attempt is clearly referenced but framed as historical. Current suicidal ideation is explicitly stated but lacks connection to recent actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post confirms **current suicidal thoughts** (""I've begun having those thoughts again""), satisfying the core criterion for *Ideation*.  
   - No evidence of plans, methods, or preparatory actions moves this out of *Behavior*.  
   - The past attempt is noted but does not override the classification of current ideation (per rules: *Attempt* requires a recent/concrete action, not historical mentions).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) and distress, but there are **no explicit or strongly implied references to suicide, death, dying, or a desire to end life** (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I won’t be here tomorrow""). Self-harm is referenced as a coping mechanism (""I can't even cope in the way that works best""), not as a means to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""It’s getting to be too much""), isolation, fear of abandonment, and shame are present. However, these are **coupled with self-harm ideation as a coping strategy, not suicidal intent**.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: **No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or imminent intent** (e.g., timing like ""tonight"") are mentioned. Self-harm (""cut"") is discussed but framed as an inaccessible coping tool, not a suicide attempt.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes **current emotional struggles and self-harm ideation** but **no past suicide attempts or actions**.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress, depression, and self-harm ideation but lacks **any explicit/implied suicidal intent, plans, methods, or actions**.  
   - Self-harm (e.g., cutting) is distinct from suicidal behavior; here, it is presented as a coping mechanism the writer feels unable to use.  
   - Per the rules:  
     - **Indicator** fits because the content expresses emotional pain and vague harmful thoughts without clear suicidal desire.  
     - **Ideation** requires explicit suicidal intent (absent here).  
     - **Behavior/Attempt** require plans, actions, or past attempts (none present).

Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key Elements**:  
     - Explicit suicidal intent: ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" ""finally ending,"" ""22 years on this earth was enough,"" and a farewell (""Goodbye"").  
     - Emotional indicators: Relief (""feel so relaxed""), hopelessness (""the last 1 year the less said the better"").  
     - **No specific method** (e.g., pills, jumping) or **preparations** (e.g., buying tools, writing a note) mentioned.  
     - **Imminent timing**: ""one last time before I end it all"" implies action will follow immediately after playing the game.  
     - **No reference to past attempts**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. ""End it all"" and ""call it quits"" are strong, culturally unambiguous implications of suicide.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method** or preparation described.  
   - **Imminent intent is present**: ""before I end it all"" ties the act directly to completing the game, indicating immediacy.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Future intent**: Focuses on impending action (""before I end it all""), not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal intent is explicit and strong (beyond vague hopelessness), ruling out **Indicator**.  
   - No description of past actions (e.g., ""I tried""), ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - While no method/preparation is specified, **imminent intent** (""one last time before..."") elevates it beyond passive thoughts (**Ideation**) to **Behavior** (per rules: ""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method"").

She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis  

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes **another person's suicide attempt** (""she had tried to kill herself"") and the author's concern for her safety.  
   - The author expresses **fear and helplessness** (""I'm scared,"" ""pls tell me how do I know if she is ok"") but **no self-referential language** about death, suicide, or self-harm.  
   - **No explicit or implied suicidal intent** from the author. No plans, methods, preparations, or expressions of wanting to die are mentioned for the author.  
   - **Emotional context**: Distress is tied to worry for another person, not personal hopelessness or suicidality.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**. Suicide is mentioned only regarding a third party. The author does not express any desire to die or end their own life.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No methods, preparations, or imminent intent are described for the author.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References to suicide (""tried to kill herself three days ago"") are **past events involving another person**, not the author.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author shows **general distress** but **zero evidence of personal suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt**.  
   - Distress is solely reactive (concern for another person), falling under vague emotional struggle without self-directed suicidal intent.  
   - **Rules reminder**: Categories apply **only to the author**, not others mentioned.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I will hang myself now"" and ""that will kill me"" explicitly state suicidal intent and method.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The method (hanging) is specified, and actions are described (""looking for something to tie""). Imminent timing (""now"") and preparation efforts are clear.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes **current/future intentions** (""I will hang myself now"") with active steps underway. No past attempts are mentioned.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness, loneliness, and despair are present (e.g., ""nobody has ever liked me,"" ""I’ve been alone since I was 5""), but these support rather than override the explicit suicidal intent and actions.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond suicidal thoughts (Ideation) by detailing a **specific method (hanging)** and **immediate preparations** (""looking for something to tie""). This aligns with the **Behavior** category, defined as explicit suicidal intent plus plans/preparations or imminent timing.
   - Rules clarification: The absence of a past attempt rules out ""Attempt,"" while the explicit plan and actions disqualify ""Indicator"" and ""Ideation.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The post expresses intense distress (""shattered,"" ""miserable,"" ""ripped apart""), hopelessness (""don't know how to live anymore""), and functional impairment (""can barely function,"" ""shaking"").  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The user explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" directly **denying** active suicidal desire. No phrases imply death/suicide (e.g., ""want to be gone,"" ""end my life"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current emotional suffering; no references to past attempts or future plans.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows severe distress but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent** (denied by the user).  
   - Vague hopelessness (e.g., ""don’t know how to live"") without suicidal desire aligns with **Indicator**.  
   - No evidence of ideation (desire to die), behavior (plans/preparations), or attempt (past actions).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post contains direct statements: ""I just want to kill myself"" and ""I want out now."" Both are explicit expressions of suicidal intent (Yes).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""I can't handle it,"" ""Tf is this life?""), hopelessness (""I don't see the need""), and urgency (""I want out now"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) are mentioned. Urgency (""now"") lacks concrete steps or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intent (""I want out now""). No references to past attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""I want out now""). Emotional context confirms severe distress with clear intent (Yes/Yes).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent actions described. Urgency alone is insufficient for ""behavior"" without a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes current ideation, not past actions (e.g., no mention of prior attempts).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself,"" ""I want out now"") but lacks any plan, method, or action. This aligns with **Ideation** (explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).

You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post opens with ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (clear misspelling of ""die"") and later states, ""if you change your mind and you want to do it,"" directly referencing suicide.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Extreme hopelessness (""you are depressed, you have no skills""), self-loathing (""everyone hates themselves""), and blame toward society (""the world wronged you"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are detailed: ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"" to cause destruction, and explicit instructions to ""learn how to make nitroglycerin at home"" and target ""one of the biggest power plants.""  
   - **Preparations/Actions**: Yes. The post urges research (""research where to find the parts"") and logistical planning (""take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on future intent (""if you want to do it,"" ""go out with bang""), with no mention of past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct expressions include ""I WANT TO DOIE"" and ""want to do it."" Strong implications like ""go silently into the night"" (alluding to death) further support suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Methods (nitroglycerin, wire cutters), locations (power plants), and preparatory steps (research, acquiring materials) are explicitly outlined. Imminent intent is implied through urgent language (""do your best"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Future-oriented**. The post discusses hypothetical actions (""if you change your mind"") and planning, with no reference to past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Ideation** due to specific methods (bomb-making, infrastructure sabotage) and preparations (research, acquiring tools). It lacks description of a past **Attempt**. The combination of suicidal intent (""want to do it"") with concrete plans/preparations fits **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes severe bullying directed at the author's friend, including explicit commands from the bully (e.g., ""go kill yourself"") and threats of violence.  
   - The author expresses concern for the friend's mental state (e.g., ""mentally disturbing,"" ""constantly tired,"" refusal to eat/go out, feeling overwhelmed).  
   - **No explicit or implied suicidal intent from the author**. The phrase ""go kill yourself"" is attributed to the bully targeting the friend, not the author.  
   - Emotional indicators (helplessness, anger) relate to the friend's situation and frustration with the bully. No personal expressions of hopelessness, self-harm desires, or suicidal thoughts from the author.  
   - **No plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts** by the author. The focus is solely on external events (bullying) and advocacy for justice.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**. Suicide references (""go kill yourself"") are quotes from the bully targeting a third party (the friend). The author does not express personal suicidal ideation.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No methods, preparations, or imminent intent are mentioned by the author.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes ongoing bullying (5 days) and its impact on the friend. **No past/current suicidal actions** by the author.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author shows distress about their friend’s well-being but **lacks any explicit/implied personal desire to die, plans, or actions**.  
   - The quoted suicidal language is from the bully, not the author. The author’s emotional state (frustration, protectiveness) falls under general distress without suicidal intent.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Vague references to death (""go kill yourself"") are contextualized as bullying, not the author’s intent. Severe distress alone is insufficient for higher categories.

Strong expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself,"" ""I really don’t know how much longer I could last"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""I feel so alone,"" ""I have nothing to look forward to""), hopelessness (""I am a loser""), and isolation are noted.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method is explicitly stated: ""I want to hang myself."" Imminent intent is implied (""how much longer I could last"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intentions (""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""I want to hang myself""). No mention of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned and strongly implied (Yes/Yes). The emotional context confirms severe distress with clear intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (""hang myself"") is stated. Urgency (""how much longer I could last"") signals imminent intent, leaning toward 'behavior'.

   - References current/future ideation and intent. No past attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (explicit suicidal intent present).  
   - It surpasses *Ideation* due to a specific method (""hang myself"") and imminent urgency.

   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a **past attempt** (""last night I attempted"") and ongoing ideation (""still want to attempt again"").

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core of the post describes a **concrete past suicide attempt** (""last night I attempted once again"") and references multiple past attempts (""15th time"").  
   - The mention of ongoing ideation (""still want to attempt again"") does not override the clear description of a past attempt.

   - **Temporal context**:  
     - References past similar episodes (""as I’ve done this before"") but focuses on **current** feelings of despair and passive death wishes. No description of a past attempt.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes **strongly implied suicidal intent** (""I hope I don’t wake up"") without methods, preparations, or imminent timing.  
   - This aligns with **Ideation**: passive to active suicidal thoughts without concrete plans or actions.  
   - Rules out **Behavior** (no plan/action) and **Attempt** (no past/concrete action described). Severe hopelessness alone is insufficient for **Indicator** due to the implied death wish.

   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. Mentions past *intent* (""I never did it"") but no description of actions taken. Focus is on current/future actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""tried to pass a week ago,"" ""suicidal episodes,"" and ""i swallowed bleach"" explicitly reference suicide/self-harm.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""depressed,"" ""cry at midnight,"" ""hidden things"") and distress are present but secondary to the explicit suicidal actions.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Specific method (swallowing bleach) and preparation (leaving a suicide note) are described.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: Yes. The user details a concrete past action: swallowing bleach with suicidal intent, followed by vomiting and physical aftereffects (heartburn). The phrase ""tried to pass a week ago"" confirms this was an initiated attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. Direct references to suicide (""suicidal episodes,"" ""tried to pass"") and self-harm (swallowing bleach) are present.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   Yes. Specific method (bleach) and preparatory actions (writing a suicide note) are explicitly stated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   Past event. The attempt occurred ""a week ago,"" and the user describes it retrospectively.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** with clear initiation of action (swallowing bleach) and suicidal intent (""tried to pass,"" suicide note).  
   - This fits the **Attempt** category, which includes incomplete or interrupted attempts (vomiting prevented completion).  
   - Current well-being (""im a little okay now"") or recovery context does not override the past attempt classification.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key Elements**: The post mentions severe emotional distress (""lost all will to live,"" ""anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse""), explicit desire to die (""I still want to die""), and a protective factor (not acting due to parents' potential grief). No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - **Yes**: ""I still want to die"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**: Strong hopelessness (""lost all will to live"") reinforces intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No**: No methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The protective factor (parents) implies restraint, not action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - Refers to **current/future intentions** (""I still want to die""). No past attempts described (e.g., ""I tried"" refers to coping efforts, not suicide).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and hopelessness align with **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts rules out **Behavior** and **Attempt**.

I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - The post explicitly states: ""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end."" This directly references suicidal thoughts.  
     - Phrases like ""my end will only get nearer"" and ""I'm fine with either outcome"" (where one outcome is implied death) strongly imply acceptance of death as a possibility.  
     - **Conclusion**: Yes, suicidal intent is explicit and strongly implied.  

   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - Mentions using LSD (""take a few tabs of acid"") as an intervention, but frames it as a trial with two outcomes: recovery or worsening suicidality.  
     - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) is described.  
     - No preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) or actions taken toward suicide are mentioned.  
     - No imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated; the timeline remains vague (""months on end"").  
     - **Conclusion**: No plan, method, or behavioral steps are present.  

   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - References ongoing suicidal thoughts (""thinking of suicide for months on end"") and future uncertainty (""if it doesn’t [help]... my end will only get nearer"").  
     - No mention of past attempts or actions.  
     - **Conclusion**: Focuses on current/future ideation, not past behaviors.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""thinking of suicide"") and a resigned acceptance of death (""my end will only get nearer,"" ""I'm fine with either outcome"").  
   - However, it lacks:  
     - A specific suicide plan or method.  
     - Preparations or actions taken toward suicide.  
     - Imminent intent or references to past attempts.  
   - This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as expressing suicidal thoughts without concrete plans or actions. The LSD use is framed as a potential coping mechanism, not a suicide method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""end it all,"" or ""not be alive"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Expresses distress (""hit a new low,"" ""haven’t felt ok""), hopelessness (""not sure what to do""), and uses substances (hydrocodone/alcohol) to cope—but **no suicidal intent** is stated or implied.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Mentions stealing hydrocodone and drinking, but frames it as seeking temporary relief (""to feel ok for one night""), **not** as a suicide plan or preparation.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Describes current actions (""tonight"") with no reference to past attempts or future suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**. No explicit or implied desire to die (e.g., ""feel ok"" contrasts with suicidal intent).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. Substance use is contextualized as coping, not a method for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Current distress only**. No past attempts or future plans described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and harmful coping (substance misuse) but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal ideation, plans, or actions**.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: General distress without suicidal intent (e.g., ""not sure what to do"" aligns with helplessness, not a desire to die).

131,31/m - I see no point in living anymore. I don't have any friends. Nothing in my life is working out,0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post states ""I see no point in living anymore,"" which strongly implies a desire to not be alive. While ""suicide"" isn’t explicitly mentioned, the phrasing conveys a clear intent to cease existing.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""Nothing in my life is working out"") and isolation (""I don’t have any friends"") are present.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes current feelings (""I see no point"") with no reference to past attempts or future plans.  
   - **Explicit/Implied Intent**: **Yes**—""no point in living"" is a strong implication of suicidal ideation.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator?** No—vague distress alone (e.g., ""life is hard"") would fit here, but the explicit desire to cease living moves beyond this.  
   - **Ideation?** **Yes**—the post expresses a strong desire to die (""no point in living"") without plans, methods, or actions.  
   - **Behavior?** No—lacks specific plans, preparations, imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight""), or actions.  
   - **Attempt?** No—no description of past or current concrete actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow"" strongly implies suicidal intent through a lethal action. Emotional context (guilt, burden) reinforces severity.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method (""pills"") is mentioned, and the action has been taken (""taken""). Imminent timing (""might not wake up tomorrow"") confirms execution.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a recent/current action (""taken pills""), not past events or future plans. The phrasing indicates the act is completed, with consequences pending.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes a concrete suicidal action (ingesting pills) with explicit intent to die (""might not wake up tomorrow""). This aligns with the **Attempt** category, which includes descriptions of initiated self-harm with suicidal intent, regardless of outcome certainty.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""planning out my suicide,"" ""fear of failing an attempt once again,"" and ""I will go through with this"" explicitly state suicidal intent and past actions.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""I can't find a reason to continue living""), isolation (""I don’t want to tell anyone""), and fear of repeated failure.
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: A specific timeline is stated (""January 1st, by my latest""). While no method is detailed, active planning (""planning out my suicide"") and preparation to avoid detection (""silently reminisce"") are evident.
   - **Past Attempts**: Directly referenced (""fear of failing an attempt once again"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide,"" ""attempt""). Strong desire to die is clear (""I will go through with this"").  
   - **Result**: Yes/Yes. Moves beyond *Indicator*.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific timing (""January 1st"") and active concealment plans (""unbeknownst to them"") indicate preparation.  
   - Imminent intent is implied (""beginning of the new year"").  
   - **Result**: Leans toward *Behavior* due to planning + timeline.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References past attempts (""failing an attempt once again"").  
   - Focuses on future intent (""January 1st"").  
   - **Result**: Current/future plans dominate; past context supports severity but doesn’t override current risk.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent + specific timeline/preparation fits *Behavior* (defined as ""suicidal thoughts plus preparations or strong intent with imminent timing"").  
   - *Ideation* is insufficient due to active planning.  
   - *Attempt* requires description of a past/completed action; here, the attempt is planned for the future.  
   - *Indicator* is ruled out by explicit intent and planning.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct expressions of suicidal intent: ""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore"" and ""kill myself."" The phrase ""I should just do it now"" strongly implies a desire to act on suicidal thoughts.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""hate being alive,"" ""wish I was never born"") and guilt (""weigh down my family and friends"") are present, reinforcing distress.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. The phrase ""do it now"" suggests urgency but lacks concrete planning.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intent (""should just do it now"") without referencing past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""do not want to live anymore"").  
   - Clear expressions of wanting to die, despite fear as a barrier.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods or preparations described. Urgency (""do it now"") leans toward ideation without crossing into behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Discusses current/future intentions (""now,"" ""later""), not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire and intent but lacks specific plans, methods, or actions. Fear of consequences (""too scared,"" ""hurt them more"") and ambivalence (""wish I was never born"") do not negate the core ideation. This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as suicidal thoughts without concrete steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly mentions ""attempt suicide"" and describes the method (""hang myself"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Describes recurring actions tied to suicidal intent (""half heartedly attempt suicide frequently"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific method (hanging) and preparation (""leave a chair or elevated object"") are detailed. Actions are taken repeatedly.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to **past actions** (""i hang myself but always...""), confirming completed behaviors (even if self-interrupted).

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes **concrete, repeated actions** (hanging with a safeguard) initiated with suicidal intent.
   - This fits the **Attempt** category:  
     - Definition includes ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions"" (e.g., standing on a chair to prevent death).  
     - Past attempts are explicitly stated (""frequently"").  
     - The presence of a method (hanging) and preparation (chair) reinforces this.  
   - *Not Ideation/Behavior*: While ideation and planning are implied, the core focus is on **reported past actions**.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Explicit suicidal actions rule this out.

I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The user explicitly states ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now"" and references a past suicide attempt (""I had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out""). Current despair is evident (""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don’t really feel like I want to go on anymore"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness, loneliness, and helplessness (e.g., ""I’m stuck,"" ""I’m alone,"" ""watching everyone move on with their lives"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific current method, plan, or imminent intent (e.g., no tools, locations, or timing like ""tonight""). Mentions past ""close calls"" but no active preparations now.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: Explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""I had an attempt when I was 14"") and subsequent ""close calls.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Direct references to being ""suicidal"" and a past attempt.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No. No current methods, preparations, or imminent timing mentioned.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on past events (attempt at age 14 and later ""close calls""). Current statements express ongoing ideation but no active steps.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes both current suicidal ideation (""I don’t want to go on"") and a clear description of a **past suicide attempt**.  
   - Per the rules: ""If the post describes a past suicide attempt [...] classify as 'attempt'."" This overrides concurrent ideation.  
   - Does not meet ""Behavior"" (no current plan/preparation) or ""Ideation"" (past attempt is the dominant suicidal element).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No. The post contains frustration (""fuckkkkkkkk"") and life dissatisfaction (""29 still live with my parents""), but there are no explicit or strongly implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""end my life""). The emotional tone is agitated but lacks despair/hopelessness tied to suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: General distress (shame/frustration about living situation) is present, but it is vague and not coupled with expressions of hopelessness, isolation, or intent to die.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. No methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., buying tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The nonsensical text (""4kdjejdne..."") appears to be keyboard smashing, not coded language for suicide.
   - **Temporal Context**: No references to past attempts or future plans. The post describes current frustration only.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows distress but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent**, specific plans, actions, or references to past attempts. It aligns with **Indicator**, defined as expressing general distress without clear suicidal desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""killing myself,"" ""properly hang myself,"" and ""wish I could die in my sleep."" These are direct expressions of suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness and resignation are implied (e.g., ""I’ll break killing myself regardless"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are named (""hang myself,"" ""cutting""), and preparation is indicated (""figured out how to properly hang myself""). Imminent intent is implied (""one of these days I’ll finally do it"").  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: Ambiguous. ""I’ve done it many times"" could imply past actions, but lacks clarity on whether these were attempts, rehearsals, or ideation. No concrete past actions (e.g., ""I tried"") are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit or strong implications of suicidal intent? **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods mentioned? **Yes** (hanging, cutting).  
   - Preparations/actions described? **Yes** (""figured out how to properly hang myself"").  
   - Imminent intent? **Yes** (""one of these days I’ll finally do it"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Primarily future-focused intent. ""I’ve done it many times"" is vague and insufficient to confirm past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (explicit suicidal intent present).  
   - It surpasses *Ideation* due to specific methods and preparations.  
   - *Attempt* is not applicable: No clear description of a past concrete action (e.g., ""I tried"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""thoughts... telling me to end it all"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent. ""End it all"" is a common euphemism for suicide, and ""if I kept existing"" directly expresses a desire not to be alive.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. Phrases like ""feeling doomed"" and ""something worse was coming to me"" convey hopelessness and despair.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions are mentioned.
   - **Temporal Context**: The thoughts are described as persistent over ""a year,"" but there is no reference to past attempts, immediate intent (e.g., ""tonight""), or concrete actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is strongly implied (""end it all"") and paired with emotional distress (hopelessness/doom). This exceeds vague distress and confirms active suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""today"") are indicated. The absence of these elements rules out ""behavior.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""end it all"") and a desire to cease existing, fitting **Ideation**. It lacks plans/preparations (needed for ""behavior"") or descriptions of past actions (needed for ""attempt""). General distress alone would be ""indicator,"" but the strong suicidal intent elevates it to **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains explicit descriptions of suicide attempts: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor..."" Terms like ""chickened out"" confirm suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong themes of hopelessness (""lost cause,"" ""hell""), guilt/shame (""useless, shameless, pathetic loser""), and isolation are present, but these support rather than override explicit suicidal actions.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific methods are named (drowning, hanging, jumping). Actions were taken (""tried""), though interrupted by self-stopping (""chickened out"").
   - **Temporal Context**: All suicide references are past events (""tried,"" ""chickened out""). No current/future plans are stated.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Excluded. The post goes beyond vague distress with explicit suicide actions.
   - **Ideation**: Excluded. While suicidal thoughts are implied, concrete past actions dominate.
   - **Behavior**: Excluded. ""Behavior"" requires current plans/preparations. Here, actions are past.
   - **Attempt**: **Matches**. The post describes multiple past suicide attempts (drowning, hanging, jumping) with clear initiation of actions (""tried""), even if self-interrupted (""chickened out""). This fits the definition: ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions.""

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. The post describes hopelessness (""Living is not for me""), frustration, anxiety, and isolation.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. While the user mentions gaining ""confidence to kill myself,"" there is no reference to a specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), preparation (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. The statement ""I would have been gone when I was 15"" implies past suicidal thoughts but no actual attempt or action taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - Strong expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""I would have been gone"").  
   → **Result**: Yes/Yes. Clear evidence of suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") are described. Confidence to act is mentioned, but this is still a thought, not an action or plan.  
   → **Result**: No. Does not meet criteria for ""behavior.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References to suicide (""would have been gone at 15"") are past hypotheticals, not descriptions of actions taken. Current statements (""I might get the courage"") are future-oriented intentions without evidence of past attempts.  
   → **Result**: No past attempt described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal intent** (""kill myself"") and a **desire to die** (""I would have been gone"").  
   - However, it lacks **specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent** required for ""behavior.""  
   - There is **no description of a past or ongoing attempt** (required for ""attempt"").  
   - General distress and hopelessness are present, but explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond ""indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" strongly imply imminent death by suicide. ""The pain is too much"" and ""if you wanted to die"" contextualize suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""pain is too much""), shame (""taught me to hide it better"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific methods are named (Trazodone overdose combined with alcohol). Preparations are stated (""I have enough Trazodone,"" ""will get alcohol today"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Future/imminent intent (""be dead in less than 24 hours""). No past attempts described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. ""Be dead in less than 24 hours"" is a direct implication of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   Yes. Specific methods (Trazodone + alcohol) and preparations (acquiring pills/alcohol) are stated. Imminent timing (""less than 24 hours"") reinforces intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   Future-focused (""will get alcohol today,"" ""be dead in less than 24 hours""). No past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   The post exceeds *Ideation* due to concrete plans (method + preparation) and imminent intent (""less than 24 hours""). It does not describe a past action (ruling out *Attempt*). This aligns with **Behavior**: explicit suicidal intent combined with specific plans/preparations and imminent timing.

Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or strong implications of suicide (e.g., ""die,"" ""suicide,"" ""end my life""). Phrases like ""I want to give up"" and ""Why am I alive?"" convey existential despair but lack explicit/implied suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""life has no worth""), guilt, and chronic distress are present.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods, preparations, timelines, or actions.  
   - **Past Attempts**: No references to prior suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide not explicitly mentioned or strongly implied (No).  
   - Expressions like ""I want to give up"" suggest emotional exhaustion, not a direct desire to die (No).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on ongoing struggles (""struggling since childhood"") without past attempts or immediate plans.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses severe hopelessness and worthlessness but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent, plans, or past attempts**.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Distress is evident (e.g., ""life has no worth""), but suicidal ideation/action is absent per rules.

(Maybe cushion the pain idk. )I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""let myself pass away,"" ""slowly kill myself,"" and ""for it to finally kill me"" are explicit expressions of wanting to die. The statement ""I'm going to die"" reinforces suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness is evident (e.g., planning death to ""cushion the pain"" for others), but this is secondary to explicit suicidal statements.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The user specifies a method (""anorexia""), a quantifiable plan (""goal weight is 78 pounds... might have to go lower""), and preparation (adjusting weight to ensure death). The intent is active and progressing.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future actions (""I'm going to,"" ""slowly kill myself""), not past events. No mention of prior attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""let myself pass away"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present.  
   **Verdict**: Strongly indicates suicidal ideation or beyond.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Starvation via anorexia with a target weight (78 pounds or lower).  
   - Preparation: Actively pursuing weight loss to achieve fatal consequences.  
   - Intent: Imminent through ongoing behavior (""slowly kill myself"").  
   **Verdict**: Shifts classification from *ideation* to *behavior* due to concrete method and actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes current/future intent (""I'm going to,"" ""it will give people time""). No reference to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *indicator* (explicit suicidal intent) and *ideation* (specific method and active preparation).  
   - It fits *behavior*: Explicit desire to die + specific method (anorexia/weight loss) + ongoing actions to achieve death.  
   - Not *attempt*: No description of a past or immediate concrete action (e.g., ""I started starving myself today to die"").

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The word ""suicide"" is directly stated. The question (""Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?"") explicitly references ending one’s life.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The post specifies a method (""charcoal bbq in a tent"") and seeks confirmation about its feasibility for suicide. This indicates concrete consideration of a plan.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on future intent (hypothetical viability of the method), not past actions. No references to attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and identifies a specific method (charcoal bbq in an enclosed tent), fitting the **Behavior** category. It shows progression beyond ideation by evaluating a concrete plan, even if phrased as a question.  
   - Rules applied:  
     - Suicide is self-referential (""suicide from charcoal bbq"").  
     - No past attempt described → not ""Attempt"".  
     - Specific method + explicit intent → exceeds ""Ideation"" and ""Indicator"".

My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains a direct expression of suicidal desire: ""everything that makes me want to die is my own fault."" While the user later states, ""I don’t feel like actually committing die,"" the explicit phrase ""want to die"" indicates suicidal ideation. Emotional context (intense self-loathing, hopelessness, worthlessness) reinforces this intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. There are no references to methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). The user explicitly denies intent to act.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current feelings. No mention of past attempts, actions, or interrupted plans.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator?** No. While there is severe distress, the explicit phrase ""want to die"" moves beyond vague hopelessness (e.g., ""life isn’t worth living"").
   - **Ideation?** Yes. The post expresses active suicidal thoughts (""want to die"") without plans, methods, or actions. The clarification about not acting aligns with ideation (passive/active desire without concrete steps).
   - **Behavior?** No. Absence of plans, preparations, or imminent intent.
   - **Attempt?** No. No description of past or current suicidal actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct expressions of suicidal intent: ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don’t want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying."" These are strong, unambiguous declarations of a desire to end life.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe distress, hopelessness (e.g., ""I don’t care,"" ""Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down""), and self-blame are present but secondary to explicit suicidal statements.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, actions, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The language remains focused on emotional pain and passive despair.
   - **Temporal Context**: All references are to current feelings and recent events (the fight). No mention of past attempts, actions, or preparations.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""want to die,"" ""don’t want to live"") and strongly implied (""feel like dying"").  
   - **Result**: Yes/Yes. Moves beyond *Indicator*.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, tools, locations, or preparatory actions described.  
   - No imminent intent (e.g., timing like ""tonight"").  
   - **Result**: No. Insufficient for *Behavior* or *Attempt*.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Exclusively current/future-oriented despair (""I feel like dying"").  
   - No references to past attempts or actions.  
   - **Result**: Confirms absence of *Attempt*.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses active suicidal desire without plans, methods, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Fits *Ideation*: Explicit wishes to die (""I want to die"") dominate, but lack concrete steps or historical attempts.  
   - Emotional distress supports severity but does not override the explicit suicidal intent required for *Ideation*.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it.

Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key Elements**: The post expresses intense emotional distress (hopelessness, self-loathing, confusion) and describes intrusive thoughts about violence, self-invalidation, and a desire for severe harm (e.g., wanting sexual assault or illness to ""feel valid""). 
   - **Metaphorical Language**: The extended metaphor of self as a ""sick dog"" waiting to be ""put down"" strongly implies a desire to end life. Phrases like ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down"" equate the user’s suffering to euthanasia, indicating suicidal intent.
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions?**: No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but the ""put down"" metaphor is a strong implication of wanting to die (e.g., ""the 'dog' put itself down""). **Yes** to implied expressions of not wanting to be alive.
   - **Plan or Method?**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools). The ""3 weeks"" timeframe suggests intent but lacks imminence or concrete actions. **No**.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future suffering (""I'm giving it 3 weeks"") with no references to past suicide attempts or actions. **No past attempts described**.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** due to strong implied suicidal intent (metaphor of being ""put down"" and devaluing human life). 
   - It lacks specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions, ruling out **Behavior** and **Attempt**.
   - Falls under **Ideation**: Strong implied desire to die (passive: ""waiting to be put down""; active: ""the 'dog' put itself down"") without concrete plans or actions. Emotional despair reinforces suicidal thoughts but no steps toward enactment.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" and ""suicide pact"" directly reference suicidal intent. Emotional context includes shame, guilt, and feeling ""obligated"" to act.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The user describes ""plotting"" suicide for months and explicitly mentions drafting a will as a preparatory action (""Yesterday, I drafted my will""). This constitutes concrete preparation.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The drafting of the will is a recent action (""yesterday""), and plotting has occurred ""on and off for months,"" indicating ongoing intent. No past attempts are described.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post moves beyond **Ideation** (general desire to die) due to specific preparations (drafting a will).  
   - It fits **Behavior** because:  
     - Preparatory actions are taken (will drafting).  
     - Strong intent is implied through prolonged plotting and feelings of obligation.  
   - **Attempt** is ruled out—no description of initiating self-harm.  
   - **Indicator** is insufficient due to explicit suicidal intent and actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""I want to die""). Phrases like ""i want it to stop"" refer to ending emotional pain or interpersonal conflict, not life. Emotional distress (hopelessness, isolation) is present but lacks clear suicidal desire.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight""). The focus is on relational distress, not actionable steps toward self-harm.
   - **Temporal Context**: No references to past attempts or self-harm actions. The post describes current emotional reactions to interpersonal events.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong distress, feelings of abuse, hopelessness (""i have no one""), and frustration. However, these alone do not imply suicidal intent without explicit ideation.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses severe distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit/implied suicidal thoughts, plans, or past actions. Vague statements like ""i want it to stop"" address ending suffering, not life. This aligns with **Indicator**, defined as general distress without clear suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct phrases: ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" and ""I want to kill myself."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. The author describes feeling overwhelmed, ""in a rut,"" having a ""very small support system,"" and self-loathing (""too weak and pathetic"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: 
     - A specific timeframe is mentioned (""tomorrow while my mom is out""), indicating imminent intent. 
     - No concrete method (e.g., pills, jumping) or physical preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are described.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on future intent (""tomorrow"") with no references to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Direct statements like ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I want to die tomorrow"" leave no ambiguity about suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method?** No.  
   - **Preparations/actions?** No physical steps (e.g., writing a note, gathering tools) are described.  
   - **Imminent intent?** Yes. The phrase ""I want to die tomorrow"" signals strong intent with a clear timeline.  
   - *Conclusion*: Imminent intent without a method still qualifies for 'behavior' under the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Future-oriented (""tomorrow""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""yeet myself"" is slang implying suicidal intent (equivalent to ""kill/harm myself""). This is a strong implication of a desire to end life, supported by emotional despair (e.g., ""dead inside,"" ""beyond saving"").  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes current feelings (""I just want"") and general hopelessness, but no reference to past attempts or actions taken.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe despair (""beyond saving""), anhedonia (""still anhedonic""), and hopelessness about the future (""they won’t last"") reinforce suicidal intent.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal intent is explicit via ""yeet myself,"" aligning with **Ideation** (strong desire to die without plans/actions).  
   - No methods, preparations, or past attempts shift it away from **Behavior**/**Attempt**. General distress alone would be **Indicator**, but explicit suicidal intent overrules this.

God im such a fucking loser. i could really use someone to talk too. All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all. I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""I tried to end it once before"" explicitly references a past suicide attempt. The follow-up, ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded,"" strongly implies ongoing suicidal ideation linked to that attempt.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""I’m such a fucking loser""), isolation (""could really use someone to talk to""), and despair are present but secondary to the explicit suicide reference.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The suicidal reference is solely about the *past attempt*.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The phrase ""tried to end it **once before**"" and ""wish i succeeded"" clearly reference a **past attempt**, not current/future actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out—explicit past suicide attempt is mentioned.  
   - **Ideation**: Ruled out—ideation focuses on *current* thoughts without actions, but this describes a concrete past action.  
   - **Behavior**: Does not apply—no current plan, preparation, or imminent intent is stated.  
   - **Attempt**: **Fits perfectly**—the post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""tried to end it"") with regret it wasn’t successful. Per the rules, a clear past attempt (even if incomplete) overrides concurrent ideation.

156,Can I please ! Talk to someone ? I'm having a bad panic attack. 18 and over please I just wanna kill myself out of fear,1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""I just wanna kill myself"" is a direct, unambiguous expression of suicidal intent. The emotional context (panic attack, fear) supports severe distress but doesn't diminish the explicit desire to die.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned. The statement is a declaration of desire without actionable steps.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes current feelings (""I'm having a bad panic attack"") and present ideation (""I just wanna kill myself""), with no reference to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly states a desire to die (""kill myself""), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - It lacks any plan, method, preparation, or reference to past/ongoing actions, ruling out **Behavior** and **Attempt**.  
   - Emotional distress (panic attack) alone doesn't qualify as **Indicator** since suicidal intent is explicit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - The phrase ""get it over with"" strongly implies a desire to end life (e.g., equivalent to ""end it all"").  
     - ""Why keep going?"" signals active suicidal ideation (desire not to continue living).  
     - **Result**: Strongly implied suicidal intent (**Yes**).  

   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparations (e.g., writing a note).  
     - No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") or actionable steps.  
     - **Result**: Absence of plans/actions (**No**).  

   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Focuses on current mental state (""Now my brain is screaming..."") and recurring despair (""Every time I am back here"").  
     - **No mention of past actions or attempts**.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **active suicidal desire** (""get it over with,"" ""why keep going?"") and extreme hopelessness (""I'll never be out of this torture cycle"").  
   - However, it lacks specifics about **methods, preparations, or past actions**.  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Explicitly implied intent to die without plans or behaviors.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states, ""I currently have suicidal thoughts."" This is a direct expression of suicidal ideation.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. The user describes feeling ""annoyed,"" ""stupid,"" and ""offended,"" with shame about crying and hopelessness about others' behavior. However, these support the context but are secondary to the explicit suicidal statement.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal thoughts are described as current (""currently have suicidal thoughts""), with no reference to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. ""I currently have suicidal thoughts"" is an unambiguous declaration of suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No. No methods, preparations, or imminent intent are indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current thoughts only. No past attempts or actions are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I currently have suicidal thoughts"") but lacks any reference to plans, methods, preparations, or past actions. This aligns with the **Ideation** category, defined as explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete steps or behaviors.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""planning to commit suicide,"" ""I have to go,"" and ""end it."" Strong implications include ""I'll never be happy if I continue to live"" and ""no choice but to end it.""
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""my life won’t ever be the same""), despair (""I’ll never be happy""), anger, and sadness are present.
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., buying tools, writing notes) are mentioned. The phrase ""planning to commit suicide"" implies intent but lacks concrete details.
   - **Past Attempts/Immediacy**: No references to past attempts or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). Focus is on current/future intent without actionable steps.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""commit suicide"") and strongly implied (""I have to go,"" ""end it"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are clear (e.g., ""no choice but to end it"").  
   - **Result**: Strong suicidal intent is evident.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are described.  
   - **Result**: Insufficient for 'behavior' classification.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""planning,"" ""I have to go""). No past attempts or actions described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post states: ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide."" These are explicit references to suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong shame (""mortifying and embarrassing""), dread (""I'm dreading this""), and distress (""I feel nauseous"") are present but secondary to explicit suicidal statements.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned. The focus is on avoiding suicide by moving home.
   - **Actions/Preparations**: No current actions (e.g., acquiring tools) are described. However, the phrase ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" implies imminent past intent halted by texting the mother.
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal crisis is past-tense (""I was so close,"" ""I dumped everything""). The post describes an incomplete attempt (self-interrupted by reaching out) and current distress about moving, but no active plans.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is confirmed (""attempting suicide"").  
   - Strong desire to die is implied (""so close to attempting suicide"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") for future actions. The closest behavior is past self-interruption.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References a past near-attempt (""I was so close to attempting suicide"") interrupted by texting the mother.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a concrete past action (being on the verge of an attempt) with clear suicidal intent, halted by reaching out. This matches the **Attempt** category definition: ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions"" where a ""concrete action must have been initiated."" Current distress doesn’t override the past attempt reference.  
   - *Not Ideation/Behavior*: While suicidal thoughts are present, the core of the post centers on a past aborted attempt.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond vague distress.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course,"" directly denying suicidal intent. There are **no explicit or implied expressions of wanting to die** (e.g., ""I want to be gone"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Describes severe distress (""I cant take it,"" ""pain makes me want to scream,"" ""excruciating""), but these reflect emotional overwhelm, not suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: **None mentioned**. No methods, plans, actions, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are referenced.  
   - **Past Attempts**: **Absent**. No references to previous actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly **denied** (""I wont kill myself"").  
   - **No implied desire to die** exists.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No. The post discusses gender dysphoria, discomfort with feminine expectations (""I hate wearing makeup... girly clothing""), and a desire to transition (""I want to be a male now""). There are **no explicit or implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm** (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""end my life,"" or metaphorical equivalents).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Distress is present (e.g., ""obsessing,"" ""intensified my dysphoria,"" ""hate""), but it centers on gender identity struggles, **not hopelessness/despair tied to suicidal intent**.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: None. No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., gathering tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on **current feelings/desires** (e.g., ""I want to be a male now""), with **no references to past attempts or actions**.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses psychological distress (gender dysphoria) and a desire for gender transition but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal ideation, plans, behaviors, or past attempts**.
   - Distress alone without suicidal intent falls under **Indicator**, per the definition: ""general distress... without a clear desire to die."" Severe hopelessness alone is insufficient for higher categories without suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit suicide mentions**: Yes. The post includes strongly implied suicidal intent through phrases like ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" and ""loathe my existence."" These express a clear desire to die, even if the writer states they lack the courage to act.  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""hate myself,"" ""loathe my existence"") and despair are present but are secondary to the explicit suicidal ideation.  
   - **Plan/method identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or actions are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent timing like ""tonight""). The writer explicitly states they lack courage to act.  
   - **Temporal context**: Refers to current feelings (""wish I had"") with no mention of past attempts or actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied (""end it all"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die (""wish I had the courage to end it all"") are present.  
   - **Verdict**: Yes.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent. The statement ""I wish I had the courage"" implies inaction.  
   - **Verdict**: No.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current ideation (""wish,"" ""want"") without references to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal desire (""end it all"").  
   - **Behavior**: Excluded—no plan, method, or preparatory action.  
   - **Attempt**: Excluded—no description of past or ongoing suicidal actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit suicide mention: ""almost committed suicide"" is a direct reference to a suicidal act. ""I still consider"" implies ongoing suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: Severe anxiety, hopelessness (e.g., ""spend [birthday] alone,"" ""no friends,"" ""sick of my family"").
   - Plan/method/preparation: States they lacked means (""didn't have anything to do it with"") but confirms intent to act. The phrase ""almost committed suicide"" implies initiation of an action.
   - Past attempt: Explicitly describes an incomplete attempt (""almost committed suicide... but stopped due to lack of means"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   **Yes**. ""Committed suicide"" is explicit, and ""I still consider"" reinforces current suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   **Indirectly present**. While no specific method is named, the acknowledgment of lacking tools confirms they had considered actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   **Past event + current intent**. The attempt (""almost committed suicide"") occurred ""a few days ago,"" while ""I still consider"" indicates ongoing ideation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post centers on a **past incomplete suicide attempt** (""almost committed suicide but didn’t have anything"").  
   - Rules prioritize classifying as **Attempt** for any described past attempt (even if interrupted or incomplete), regardless of concurrent ideation.  
   - Emotional distress and ongoing thoughts (""I still consider"") are secondary to the concrete past action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post directly uses ""suicide"" three times and phrases like ""suicide with me"" and ""anyone suicide with me together"" strongly imply a desire to die. The language is explicit and urgent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: While distress is implied (e.g., seeking others to join), the focus is on active suicidal intent rather than emotional states like hopelessness alone.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: None. The post discusses current/future intentions (""want to suicide too""), not past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""suicide"") and strongly implied (""suicide with me""). Expressions like ""can anyone suicide with me together"" convey a direct wish to die.  
   - **Conclusion**: Explicit intent is clear (Yes).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timelines are described. The post focuses on recruiting others but lacks concrete steps.  
   - **Conclusion**: No plan/action identified.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The post references current/future intent (""for those want to suicide too""), not past events or attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""suicide with me"") but lacks plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions. This aligns with **Ideation** (explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).  
   - Rules applied:  
     - Intent is personal (author-focused).  
     - No past attempts → not ""Attempt"".  
     - No plans/imminence → not ""Behavior"".  
     - Explicit suicidal intent → beyond ""Indicator"".

I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains multiple explicit statements: ""I want to kms"" (kill myself), ""I really want to hang myself right now,"" ""I kill myself,"" and ""can't stop thinking about killing myself."" These are direct expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. The user expresses hopelessness (""I am a burden,"" ""It is what I deserve""), despair (""I can't focus on anything except trying again""), and fear of failure.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The user specifies hanging as a method (""hang myself,"" ""put the rope around my neck"") and describes preparatory actions (""practice hung for a minute or two""). They also mention logistical plans (packing the apartment, resigning from work) but note these are incomplete.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes both **current/future intent** (""want to hang myself right now,"" ""can't stop thinking,"" ""trying again"") and a **past action** (""I put the rope around my neck... but I stopped""). The past action is a concrete, self-interrupted suicide attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself"").  
   - Strong expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""I want to kms,"" ""can't wait any longer"").  
   → **Yes** to both.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Hanging (mention of rope and ""practice hung"").  
   - Preparations/actions: User physically placed a rope around their neck and engaged in a partial hanging.  
   - Imminent intent: ""right now,"" ""can't wait any longer.""  
   → **Yes** to all. Actions cross into behavioral territory.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References a **past attempt**: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped."" This is an incomplete suicide attempt (self-interrupted action with suicidal intent).  
   - Also expresses **current ideation/urge**: ""I really want to hang myself right now,"" ""can't focus on anything except trying again.""  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (explicit suicidal intent is present).  
   - It exceeds *Ideation* due to specific methods (hanging) and **actions taken** (partial hanging with a rope).  
   - *Behavior* applies to preparations/imminent intent, but the key here is the **description of a past suicide attempt** (incomplete hanging).  
   - **Rule application**: The category *Attempt* explicitly includes ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions"" (e.g., the user stopping mid-action). The post clearly describes such an attempt (""practice hung... but I stopped""), which takes precedence over concurrent ideation/behavior per guidelines.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""violently suicidal,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" and ""I don’t want to be here any more."" Strong implications of suicidal intent are present (e.g., ""I’m finally doing it,"" ""I’m finally going to actually do it"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe distress (sobbing for hours, feeling overwhelmed, worthlessness) and hopelessness (""I’m a fucking failure and I’ll die a failure"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: A method is vaguely referenced (""I’ve always thought I was going to get a gun""), but there is **no evidence of preparation** (e.g., obtaining a gun) or specific plan details (e.g., location, timing). The phrase ""I don’t know how exactly I’m going to do it"" weakens this.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on **current/future intent** (""I’m finally doing it,"" ""it’s finally fucking time"") with no mention of past attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit or strongly implied desire to die? **Yes** (e.g., ""I just want to fucking die"").  
   - Severe distress with implied intent? **Yes** (supports ideation/behavior).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method? **Vague reference** (gun) but no details.  
   - Preparations/actions? **None described**.  
   - Imminent intent? **Yes** (""finally doing it,"" ""finally fucking time"")—this suggests urgency but lacks concrete steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Current/future intent** dominates. No past attempts mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal intent** and **imminent timing** (""finally doing it""), aligning with **Behavior** (defined as ""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method"").  
   - However, the lack of a concrete plan or action (e.g., ""I don’t know how exactly"") prevents escalation to **Attempt**.  
   - **Ideation** is ruled out due to imminent intent beyond passive thoughts.

There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes **driving to the mountains with ""full intentions to end things""**, indicating explicit suicidal intent.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""people in my life are apathetic about my existing"") and despair (""be numb"").  
   - **Specific preparation/action** is confirmed: They traveled to a location (mountains) to act on suicidal intent.  
   - The event is **past-tense** (""I just finished driving,"" ""I don’t think I’m going to do it""), confirming an action was initiated but halted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. ""End things"" strongly implies suicide, reinforced by ""at the edge"" and context of isolation.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Location (mountains) is specified as part of the plan. Action (driving there) constitutes preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes a **past event** (driving to mountains) with aborted intent (""I don’t think I’m going to do it"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post goes beyond ideation due to **concrete action** (traveling to the mountains) with suicidal intent.  
   - This fits **Behavior**: Preparatory actions with intent, even if halted. *Not* Attempt (no description of initiating the act itself).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. ""I'm ready to die"" is a direct expression of willingness to die. ""Go out the way I want"" strongly implies ending one’s life.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""nothing in my life is changing""), despair (""Fuck this world""), and resolve (""ready to go"").
   - **Plan/Method/Preparations**: Yes. ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"" confirms active preparations. ""Strapped in and ready to go"" suggests imminent action and possible method specificity (e.g., restraint/vehicle imagery). ""The date was set a while ago"" indicates planning and timeline.
   - **Past Attempts**: None mentioned. Focus is on future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. ""I'm ready to die"" is an explicit desire to die.  
   - Yes. ""Go out the way I want"" strongly implies suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. Preparations are confirmed (""Preps being made"").

   - Future-focused (""date was set,"" ""Preps being made,"" ""ready to go""). No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Ideation** (explicit desire to die) due to confirmed **preparations** (""Preps being made"") and **imminent intent** (""strapped in and ready to go"").  
   - No description of a past or ongoing **Attempt** (no action initiated yet).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post contains a direct statement: ""Im thinking of ending my life."" This is an explicit expression of suicidal intent. Emotional context includes hopelessness (e.g., ""I hate my course,"" ""dont have much choices""), loneliness (""friends ditched me""), and distress over academic/personal struggles.  
     - *Explicit/Implied Suicide?*: **Yes** (""ending my life"").  
     - *Desire to Die?*: **Yes** (directly stated).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, tools), preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or actions taken are mentioned. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.  
     - *Method/Plan?*: **No**.  
     - *Preparation/Action?*: **No**.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Suicidal thoughts (""thinking of"") are current. Past events (e.g., OCD onset, school expulsion) are referenced, but **no past suicide attempts** are described.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""ending my life"") but lacks any plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent.  
   - This aligns with **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die without concrete steps toward action. Emotional distress alone (e.g., hopelessness) would not suffice for higher categories, but the direct suicidal statement elevates it beyond *Indicator*.  
   - Rules applied:  
     - Intent is personal (author-focused).  
     - No past attempts or behaviors override the current ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post includes phrases like ""hopefully this is my last post"" and ""pls let me never wake up."" These strongly imply a desire to cease living (e.g., ""never wake up"" = death).  
   - Emotional indicators: Desperation (""pls let me..."") and finality (""last post"").  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or actions are mentioned.  
   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is **strongly implied** (""never wake up"" = desire for permanent death).  
   - Direct expression of **not wanting to be alive** is evident.  
   - Emotional context confirms severe distress with suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons).  
   - **No** signs of preparation or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight,"" actions taken).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""im gonna do it,"" ""ready to die,"" and context (""saying im gonna do it"") strongly imply suicidal intent.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are mentioned (swallowing ""unnamed pills,"" ""old antidepressants,"" and ""allergy medicine""). Preparations are clear (""i actually have the means""). Imminent timing is explicit (""tonight"").

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Despair (""im really out of it""), hopelessness (""antidepressants [...] obviously didnt work""), and resolve (""so ready to die"").

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes the explicit phrase ""kill myself"" and strong implications like ""I want to be done"" and ""I just want to be done with everything,"" indicating a clear desire to end life.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I don't feel like anyone loves me""), loneliness (""I'm very lonely""), and despair (""tire of being an unwanted nuisance"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions taken are mentioned. The phrase ""kill myself"" is generic.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intentions (""more and more often it feels like..."") with no references to past attempts or actions. Timing is non-imminent (e.g., no ""tonight"" or immediate plans).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is explicit (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""I want to be done""). Emotional distress (loneliness, hopelessness) supports intent, but the key is the direct statement. → **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are described. → **No**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes current/future ideation only. No past attempts (e.g., ""I tried last week"") are referenced. → **Current/future intent only**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"") but lacks plans, methods, or actions. This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete steps. Emotional distress alone would be ""Indicator,"" but explicit suicidal intent elevates it to ""Ideation.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrases ""I really want to check out"" and ""how much I want to check out"" are strong euphemisms for suicide, implying a clear desire to end life. Emotional indicators like hopelessness (""spite has its limits"") and detachment from consequences (""I don’t care about what me unexpectedly checking out would do"") reinforce suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) are mentioned. There is no imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete actions described.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on **current/future intentions** (""I want to check out,"" ""spite has its limits""). No references to past attempts or actions.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""want to check out"") but lacks plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions. This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as suicidal thoughts without concrete steps. The emotional context (spite as a barrier) does not elevate it to ""behavior,"" as no actionable intent is present. It exceeds ""indicator"" due to strong implied intent to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""im going to do it"" strongly implies suicidal intent (e.g., ""it"" likely refers to suicide in this context), especially combined with ""i cant handle it anymore,"" ""im done,"" and a farewell (""thank you to the people...""). Emotional indicators include extreme distress (""im in so much pain"") and hopelessness (""i cant do this anymore"").  
     - *Explicit/Implied Intent*: **Yes** (implied desire to end life).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. However, ""im going to do it"" conveys **strong imminent intent** (e.g., immediate timing is implied by the urgency of the language).  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on **current/future intentions** (""im going to do it""), with no reference to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **strong suicidal intent** (""im going to do it"") and **imminent risk** (urgent tone, farewell), but lacks a specific method or preparation.  
   - This aligns with **Behavior**: Defined as suicidal ideation with strong intent and imminent timing, even without a method (per rules: ""strong intent with imminent timing... lean toward 'behavior'"").  
   - *Why not Ideation?* Ideation requires no imminent intent; here, the declaration ""im going to do it"" signals impending action.  
   - *Why not Attempt?* No description of past/initiated actions.  
   - *Why not Indicator?* Explicit suicidal intent is strongly implied, moving beyond general distress.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct, explicit reference to suicide. The post also expresses a desire to die as a solution to stress and hopelessness (""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""why not"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""never really seen myself going anywhere in life"") and distress (""a lot of stress"") are present, but the explicit suicidal intent supersedes these.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The user explicitly asks for a ""mostly painless way to kill myself,"" indicating active consideration of methods. Though no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is named, the request for a painless method implies research or preparation.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on current/future intentions (""right now,"" ""would be easier""). No past attempts are mentioned.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post goes beyond vague distress (Indicator) due to explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"").  
   - It exceeds Ideation (passive thoughts) because the user is actively seeking methods, signaling preparatory behavior.  
   - No concrete actions (e.g., acquiring tools) or past attempts are described, ruling out Attempt.  
   - **Behavior** fits best: The combination of explicit suicidal intent and method-seeking aligns with ""preparations or actions taken"" (here, researching methods).

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses the physical consequences of overdosing on pills but does **not** express the author's personal desire to die, self-harm, or suicidal intent.  
   - Emotional context is informational/warning-focused (e.g., ""Don’t take the pills""), not expressions of hopelessness or despair about the author's own state.  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes, ""commit suicide"" and ""end it with pills"" appear, but these are general statements or warnings directed at others, **not** the author’s own feelings or plans.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Methods (overdosing) are described, but as cautionary examples. **No** indication the author has prepared, acted, or has imminent intent.  
   - **Temporal Context**: No references to the author’s past attempts or current/future actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author’s intent is to dissuade others from suicide, not to express personal suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors.  
   - Mentions of suicide are clinical/educational (e.g., explaining outcomes) rather than personal ideation.  
   - Lacks explicit/implicit desire to die from the author. Severe distress or intent is absent.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: General discussion of suicide methods without expressions of the author’s intent, plans, or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post includes strong implications of suicidal intent: ""im positive im gonna do it"" and ""no motivation to keep on living"" directly express a desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators are present (hopelessness, lack of motivation), but the core focus is the explicit future intent to end life.  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or actions are mentioned (e.g., tools, locations, notes).  
   - No references to past attempts or actions. Temporal context is future-oriented (""gonna do it in the future,"" ""when im fed up"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""im positive im gonna do it"" strongly implies suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**: ""no motivation to keep on living"" expresses a desire not to be alive.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are described.  
   - **No**: Intent is future-focused (""in the future,"" ""when im fed up"") but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers strictly to future intentions (""gonna do it in the future""). No past attempts or actions mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal intent (""gonna do it,"" ""no motivation to keep on living"") but lacks any specific plan, method, preparation, or reference to past actions.  
   - This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as expressing suicidal thoughts without concrete plans or actions. The reassurance (""im good rn"") and future-focused timing do not override the clear desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No. The post describes a terrifying dream about being a victim of mass violence, not self-harm or suicide. Phrases like ""mass murdering people"" and ""slicing up as many people as they could"" refer to external violence, not personal suicidal intent. Emotional distress (panic, terror, anxiety) is present, but there are **no explicit or implied expressions of wanting to die** (e.g., ""I want to be gone,"" ""I can’t go on"").  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. The post focuses on fear from a nightmare and its aftermath (anxiety about sleep). **No methods, preparations, or imminent suicidal plans** are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post discusses a past dream and current anxiety but **no references to past/current suicidal actions or intent**.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress (panic attacks, sleep anxiety) but lacks any explicit or strongly implied suicidal desire, plan, or behavior.  
   - Vague references to death (e.g., the dream’s violence) are **external and victim-focused**, not expressions of personal intent to self-harm.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""do it"" (in context of needing belief to act), ""end this suffering,"" and explicit reference to past overdoses (""overdosed twice... once on purpose"") strongly imply suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe distress (""fear and despair,"" ""suffering""), hopelessness (""I don't want to believe there's nothing""), and desperation (""please give me strength"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific method (overdosing) is mentioned in past actions.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Clear reference to **past suicide attempts** (""I’ve overdosed twice... once on purpose"") and current ideation (""I need something to believe in so I can do it"").  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes **past suicide attempts** (""overdosed... on purpose""), which falls under the **Attempt** category per the rules.  
   - Even with current ideation (""I need... to do it""), the explicit description of a past attempt takes precedence. The Attempt category includes incomplete/interrupted actions, and the post confirms suicidal intent during the overdose (""all I saw was fear and despair"").

   - **Plan/Method Identification**: None. No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to **current** suicidal ideation (""I'm suicidal again"") and a past period of improvement. No description of past attempts or actions.

It's just too hard.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes a direct expression of suicidal desire: ""I want to die more than ever."" This is an explicit statement of wanting to end life.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""I can't have this life it's too painful""), hopelessness (""Every time I try I fail""), and worthlessness (""she thinks I'm worthless"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.
   - **Temporal Context**: All references are to current emotional distress and ideation. No mention of past attempts or actions taken.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit statement ""I want to die more than ever"" confirms **suicidal intent**, ruling out *Indicator*.
   - Absence of plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent excludes *Behavior*.
   - No description of past or ongoing suicide actions (e.g., ""I tried"") rules out *Attempt*.
   - The post squarely fits **Ideation**: strong expressions of suicidal desire without concrete plans or actions.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly mentions ""suicide by hanging"" and discusses a method (""tied the noose""), indicating direct engagement with suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Uncertainty (""im still not sure"") and a plea for honesty about pain, implying distress but not standalone hopelessness.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method (hanging) is named, and **preparatory action is confirmed** (""ive alr tied the noose"").
   - **Temporal Context**: The preparation (""tied the noose"") is a **current action**, not a past attempt. No references to prior attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide by hanging"").  
   - Desire to die is strongly implied through method inquiry and noose preparation.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Hanging.  
   - **Preparation confirmed**: ""tied the noose"" constitutes a concrete step toward action.  
   - Uncertainty (""still not sure"") doesn’t negate preparatory behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current intent/preparation** (e.g., ""alr tied""). No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (explicit suicidal content).  
   - It surpasses *Ideation* due to **confirmed preparation** (tying the noose).  
   - Not *Attempt*, as no past/ongoing act is described (e.g., no mention of initiating hanging).  
   - **Fits *Behavior***: Explicit suicidal ideation + specific method + tangible preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: ""Should I kill myself?"" is a direct reference to suicide. ""I want to die because of them"" explicitly expresses a desire to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Shame (""I'm a pervert""), distress (""I can't help my sexual feelings""), and self-loathing are present.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: All statements reflect current thoughts/feelings. No references to past actions or attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post contains **explicit suicidal intent** (""kill myself,"" ""want to die"") but lacks plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions.  
   - This aligns with **Ideation**: Strong expressions of suicidal desire without actionable steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: ""i just wanna end it"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent (equivalent to ""I want to die"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Extreme anger, hatred toward family, trauma from sexual assault, and despair (""i hate everything"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, timelines, or actions described.  
   - **Past Attempts/References**: No mention of prior suicide attempts or actions.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Desire (""wanna end it"") is present-tense, indicating current ideation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - ""End it"" strongly implies a desire to die (Yes).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current feelings, not past events (No past attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""end it"") but lacks specific plans, methods, or actions. This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts without concrete steps. Emotional distress alone (e.g., hatred, trauma) doesn’t elevate it to ""Behavior"" without a plan/action.

And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses past experiences of extreme distress where the author felt unable to cope, explicitly mentioning being ""on the brink of suicide.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""felt like I couldn’t cope"") and escapism (""walk away from anything bothering you"").  
   - **No explicit/implied desire for self-harm or death by the author**. Instead, the author advocates vagrancy as an *alternative* to suicide.  
   - References to past actions (going vagrant) are **coping strategies**, not suicide attempts. Phrases like ""the road has saved me"" confirm this is a survival narrative.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**. The author mentions suicide only in the context of advising others (""anyone on the brink of suicide""). Their own statements lack personal suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. The author describes past coping actions (e.g., ""went vagrant,"" ""sleeping on cardboard""), but these are alternatives to suicide, not methods/preparations for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past-focused (""on two occasions,"" ""saved me in the past""). No current/future intent. Actions described (vagrancy) are **not suicide attempts**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress and hopelessness but frames suicide as a risk for *others*, not the author. The author’s solutions (vagrancy) are life-preserving escapes.  
   - **Indicator** fits: Vague references to suicide risk (e.g., ""brink of suicide"") lack personal intent. Distress is present, but no desire to die, plans, or actions by the author.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""end it"" strongly imply a desire to die or end life.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Clear hopelessness (""my life has been getting worse""), loneliness, despair (""I fucked up my life""), and isolation.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned. However, ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" indicates **imminent intent** (timing: ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to future intent (""tonight I'm... going to end it""). No mention of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied (""end it"") with severe emotional distress. → **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No method, but imminent intent (""tonight"") is stated. → **Leans toward 'behavior'** per rules (strong intent + imminent timing).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Future-focused intent (""tonight""). No past attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""end it"") and imminent intent (""tonight""), meeting the **Behavior** category criteria (strong intent + imminent timing without a method). Emotional distress alone would be ""Indicator,"" but intent + timing elevates it. No concrete actions (e.g., preparing tools) or past attempts, ruling out ""Attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""successfully end my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent, indicating a desire to die.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods (800mg codeine + ibuprofen) are mentioned, and the user provides personal details (weight, height) to assess lethality, indicating active preparation.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Present/future intent. The post focuses on current capability (""Will I be able to..."") and imminent action.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Not explicitly stated, but the query implies hopelessness/despair tied to suicidal planning.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent (""end my life"").  
   - **Ideation**: Ruled out. While suicidal thoughts are present, the post includes specific methods and preparations, moving beyond ideation.  
   - **Behavior**: Fits best. The post details a concrete plan (drug overdose), preparations (access to pills, dosage calculation), and imminent intent (assessing feasibility based on physical traits).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - Strongly implied expressions of wanting to die: ""resisting the desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""i fuckingcant do this anymore,"" ""i cant stand being here any other moment.""  
     - Severe hopelessness and despair: ""i never been happy since birth,"" ""nobody knows how i suffer everyday,"" ""i cant imagine myself living another year thisway.""  
     - **Verdict**: **Yes** to implied suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions taken (e.g., writing a note).  
     - No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete plans.  
     - **Verdict**: **No** to plans/methods.

     - Focuses on persistent, ongoing suffering (""everyday,"" ""since birth"") and future dread (""rest of my life,"" ""another year"").  
     - **No references to past attempts or actions**.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal intent is **strongly implied** (desire to end life, inability to endure existence) but lacks:  
     - Specific plans/methods → Rules out *Behavior*.  
     - Descriptions of past actions → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Falls under **Ideation**: Explicit expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""resisting the desire to end"") without plans, preparations, or past attempts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""commit suicide"" is direct. The statement ""will probably commit suicide eventually"" expresses a clear desire to end one's life in the future.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness is present (""probably commit suicide eventually""), but the core focus is explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method, preparation, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned. ""Eventually"" implies non-immediacy.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to future intent (""will probably... eventually""). No past attempts described.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent (""commit suicide"") moves this beyond **Indicator**.  
   - No method, preparation, or imminent timing rules out **Behavior** or **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"" is a strong, explicit expression of suicidal intent (""end myself""). This indicates a direct desire to die, not just general distress.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The post includes hopelessness (""I'm losing grip,"" ""I can't cope""), despair (""I can't stop crying""), and isolation (""I don't know who to turn to""). However, these alone are secondary to the explicit suicidal language.
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned. The voices urge action but lack concrete details.
   - **Past Attempts/Events**: References to past financial mistakes and current emotional struggles are noted, but there are no mentions of prior suicide attempts or actions taken toward suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""End myself"" is an unambiguous expression of suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""end myself"" directly implies a desire to die.  
   - **Context**: Emotional distress reinforces intent, pushing this beyond vague hopelessness.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method**: No tools, locations, or techniques described.  
   - **No preparations/actions**: No evidence of steps taken (e.g., writing notes, gathering means).  
   - **No imminent intent**: Timing is unspecified (e.g., no ""now"" or ""tonight""). Voices encourage action but lack urgency or concreteness.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Past events**: Financial mistakes occurred ""years ago,"" but current suicidal thoughts are explicitly *present*.  
   - **No past attempts**: No references to prior suicide actions or self-interrupted behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post contains **explicit suicidal intent** (""end myself""), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of methods, preparations, or imminent timing rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past or ongoing suicide actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - While distress is severe, explicit suicidal intent disqualifies **Indicator**.  
   - **Conclusion**: Suicidal thoughts are clearly expressed, but no plans/actions are indicated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" is a *rejection* of suicidal thoughts. There are no explicit mentions (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strong implications of active desire to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). Instead, the post emphasizes hope and future-oriented resilience.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: While distress is acknowledged (""even if I’m not okay right now""), the tone is predominantly hopeful (""a hopeful thought,"" ""maybe I can find someone,"" ""I can be okay""). No despair, shame, or helplessness suggesting imminent risk.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No references to methods, preparations, timelines, or actions.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on future aspirations (""one day,"" ""for the rest of my life"") with no past attempts or current intent described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide explicitly mentioned? **No** (only negated: ""don’t need to die"").  
   - Direct/implied desire to die? **No** (rejects death as necessary).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past attempts? **No**.  
   - Current/future intent? **No** (rejects dying).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress but lacks **explicit/implied suicidal intent**. The mention of death is vague and framed as unnecessary (""maybe I don’t need to die""), aligning with **Indicator** (general distress without suicidal ideation).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly references ""suicidal thoughts"" and frames them as recurring (""when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there""). The phrase ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" directly ties these thoughts to a potential lethal method.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Boredom and impulsivity are noted, but no explicit despair/hopelessness beyond suicidal ideation.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method (taking 3 Xanax pills) is mentioned, and intent is reinforced with ""i will do it anyway."" The question about lethality implies preparation/consideration of outcomes.
   - **Temporal Context**: Current/future intent is clear (""i will do it anyway""). No reference to past attempts.
   - **Key Takeaway**: Suicidal ideation is explicit, paired with a specific method and declared intent to act imminently.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit mention: **Yes** (""suicidal thoughts"").  
   - Desire to die: **Implied** (lethality question + dismissal of劝阻).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: **Yes** (taking 3 Xanax pills).  
   - Preparations/actions: **Implied** (intent to proceed despite warnings).  
   - Imminent intent: **Yes** (""i will do it anyway"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to **current/future** actions (no past attempts described).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post moves beyond *Indicator* due to explicit suicidal ideation.  
   - It exceeds *Ideation* by detailing a method (""3 xanax pills"") and demonstrating intent to act (""i will do it anyway"").  
   - *Attempt* is inapplicable as no prior action is described.  
   - **Behavior** fits: Specific method + imminent intent (Rules: ""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method"" applies here due to declared action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent. The emotional context (intense guilt, self-loathing, and hopelessness) reinforces this intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific suicide method, timing (e.g., ""tonight""), or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. The self-harm inquiry (""places on the body can be self-harmed"") is distinct from suicidal intent and lacks a suicide plan.
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal intent (""I will wait until I can kill myself"") is future-oriented, not describing a past or current attempt. The self-harm question is general (no action taken).

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"") with future-oriented timing, meeting the **Ideation** threshold.
   - No plan/method, preparations, or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"") are present. The self-harm question does not constitute a suicide plan or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""kill myself soon"" and ""strong urge to [kill myself]"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""life is fucking stupid""), despair (""the only people I have don’t care""), and wish to not exist (""wish I wasn’t even born"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or actions (e.g., tools, locations, notes) are mentioned.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key Elements**: The post explicitly describes a method (""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground""), indicating a concrete suicidal plan. It expresses temptation to act, emotional conflict (""guilt or fear""), and outcomes like becoming a ""cripple instead of a corpse.""
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Strongly implied. ""Plummet to the ground"" and fears of becoming a ""corpse"" signal a clear desire to die.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Specific method (jumping from height) and temptation to act (""so tempted to just go"") indicate preparation and imminent intent.
   - **Temporal Context**: Present-tense language (""so tempted,"" ""if only"") reflects current intent, not past actions. No mention of prior attempts.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds **Ideation** due to the explicit method (jumping) and temptation to act imminently.
   - It aligns with **Behavior**: Specific plan (""plummet to the ground"") + implied preparation (""go to the highest floor"") + strong intent (""so tempted"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct and explicit reference to suicide. The statement also implies a desire to die by framing suicide as a solution to relational pain (""he wont feel that bad if I kill myself"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness and relational distress are present, but these are secondary to the explicit suicidal language.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), preparation (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned. The post poses a hypothetical scenario (""If I deeply hurt my boyfriend"") rather than describing concrete steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post discusses a potential future action (""if I kill myself""), not a past attempt or current/imminent behavior. No history of attempts is referenced.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal intent (""kill myself"") but lacks any specific plan, method, preparation, or imminent timing. This aligns with the **Ideation** category, defined as explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts without concrete actions or plans. The hypothetical framing does not elevate it to ""behavior,"" as no actionable steps are described.

   - **Explicit suicide mentions**: No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but **strong implications** of suicidal intent via ""standing on the ledge... trying to work up the nerve to jump"" and ""hoping... someone will stop me.""  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Hopelessness (""no one notices""), isolation, and despair.  
   - **Plan/method identification**: Specific method (""jump"" off a hospital parking garage) and **repeated preparatory actions** (physically going to the ledge, sitting/standing for hours).  
   - **Temporal context**: Describes **ongoing, current behaviors** (e.g., ""I go hoping..."") and references a past suicide at the location but **no self-reported past attempt**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Strongly implied desire to die via ledge-standing context: **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (""jump""): **Yes**.  
   - Preparations/actions (repeated visits to ledge, testing nerve): **Yes**.  
   - Imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"")? No, but recurring behavior indicates persistent risk.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/repeated behaviors**, not past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit suicidal intent is strongly implied (ledge-jumping context).  
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific method (jumping) and repeated preparatory actions (visiting ledge) exceed passive thoughts.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past/initiated self-harm action (e.g., ""I jumped but survived"").  
   - **Behavior**: Matches due to **specific method + concrete preparatory actions** (physically positioning on ledge multiple times) without a completed attempt.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct references to suicide (""tried committing suicide,"" ""multiple attempts on my life"") and expressions of wanting to die (""my death seems [like] the ultimate answer"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""everything I earned was just mooching,"" ""it gets harder every day""), guilt (""all I caused was problems""), and isolation (""I lie every time someone asks if I’m ok"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The author explicitly states they ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself"" to make it look accidental, indicating active research into methods.
   - **Temporal Context**: References past attempts (e.g., using a phone charger) but emphasizes *current* actions (researching methods) and imminent distress (failing grades, job loss).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""committing suicide,"" ""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""my death seems [like] the ultimate answer""). **Yes/Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific actions are described: researching methods to die by suicide disguised as an accident. This constitutes **preparation**, even if no single method is finalized. Imminent intent is reinforced by worsening life circumstances (e.g., ""it gets harder every day"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past attempts are noted (""first time I tried,"" ""multiple attempts""), but the focus is on *current* suicidal behavior (active method research).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal intent and actions.  
   - **Ideation**: Excluded; while suicidal thoughts are present, the post goes beyond ideation by detailing preparatory actions (method research).  
   - **Behavior**: Fits best. The author describes active steps toward suicide (researching methods) without describing a completed attempt. This aligns with the definition: ""preparations or actions taken.""  
   - **Attempt**: Excluded; past attempts are mentioned, but the *current* risk centers on preparatory behavior, not a recent concrete action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct references to suicide, death, dying, or self-harm (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all""). Phrases like ""more dead inside"" and ""done with everything"" convey severe emotional distress (hopelessness, despair) but lack explicit or strong implication of active suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on past/ongoing emotional pain (betrayal, isolation) with no references to past suicide attempts or future plans to act.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong expressions of worthlessness (""nobody cares""), exhaustion (""done trying""), and hopelessness (""dead inside"")—but these remain in the realm of distress without crossing into suicidal intent.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post reflects intense emotional suffering and generalized despair but lacks **explicit/implied suicidal intent** required for *Ideation*.  
   - Absence of plans, methods, or actions rules out *Behavior* and *Attempt*.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Vague references to emotional collapse (e.g., ""dead inside,"" ""done with everything"") mirror the example (""life isn’t worth living"")—severe distress without suicidal ideation.

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window"" strongly imply suicidal intent (ending life). The statement ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" explicitly expresses a desire to act.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Desperation/courage-building (""I'm getting more courage"") and rationalization of method (""less scary because trees and mud below"") indicate escalating intent.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific method (jumping from a bedroom window) and location (trees/mud below) are detailed. Preparation is evident (""getting more courage"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Current/future intent (""Hopefully I can do it soon"") with imminent timing (""soon"").
   - **Past Attempts**: None mentioned.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (explicit intent present).
   - It surpasses *Ideation* due to a concrete method (jumping from window), preparations (gathering courage), and imminent timing (""soon"").
   - No description of a *past* action (e.g., ""I tried jumping"") rules out *Attempt*.
   - Matches **Behavior**: Explicit suicidal intent + specific method + preparation + imminent timing.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""writing suicide notes"" directly references suicide preparation. This is an explicit mention of a suicide-related action.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""depression hits really hard""), guilt (""waste their time""), and isolation (""keep it to myself"") are present but secondary to the explicit suicide reference.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned. However, **writing suicide notes** is a recognized preparatory action (suicide-related behavior).
   - **Temporal Context**: ""Sometimes depression hits... next thing I know I’m writing suicide notes"" implies recurring past/preparatory actions, not an immediate attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide explicitly referenced? **Yes** (""suicide notes"").  
   - Desire to die implied? **Yes** (notes imply intent).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method? No.  
   - **Preparations/actions taken? Yes** (writing suicide notes).  
   - Imminent intent? No (""sometimes"" suggests past/recurring actions, not immediate).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References past/recurring actions (""sometimes... I’m writing""), not a current attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent + preparatory action (writing notes) = **Behavior**.  
   - *Why not Ideation?* ""Writing suicide notes"" is an action beyond passive thoughts.  
   - *Why not Attempt?* No description of initiating self-harm (e.g., ""I tried to..."").  
   - *Why not Indicator?* Explicit suicide reference and behavior override general distress.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""hope i die"" and ""fuck me fuck da world"" strongly imply a desire to die or cease existing.

   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post expresses current/future desires (""hope i die"") but no references to past actions or attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is strongly implied (""hope i die"") though not explicitly stated (e.g., ""suicide""). The emotional context (despair, self-hatred) reinforces intent. → **Yes**.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis  

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post states: ""Just cut to deep fuck."" The word ""cut"" explicitly refers to a self-harm action, while ""deep"" indicates severity. The phrase implies a physical act has been performed.  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: While suicide isn’t directly named, ""cut to deep"" strongly implies self-harm with potential lethal intent (e.g., deep cutting is a known suicide method). Expressions like ""fuck"" convey intense distress. → **Yes** (strongly implied).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: A specific method (""cut"") is mentioned, and ""deep"" signals preparation/action taken. The phrasing (""Just cut"") suggests the action occurred recently or is ongoing. → **Yes**.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The use of ""Just"" implies the action is current or very recent, not past. No reference to prior attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post goes beyond vague distress (Indicator) or passive thoughts (Ideation) by describing a concrete self-harm **action** (""cut"") with severity (""deep"").  
   - This fits **Behavior**: Explicitly mentions a method (cutting) and implies an action was taken, meeting the criteria for suicidal behavior (preparation/action with intent).  
   - It does not describe a past **Attempt** (e.g., ""I tried to cut"") but focuses on immediate action.

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""every single day I feel terrible""), guilt, anxiety, depression, and fear of burdening others.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: The user mentions ""partially planning to die"" but does not specify methods, tools, locations, or preparatory actions. They note impulsiveness but lack concrete steps (e.g., ""I don’t have many strong and reliable methods"").
   - **Temporal Context**: All references are to ongoing thoughts (""for the past few months"") and future intentions (""if I keep getting worse""). No past attempts or actions are described.
   - **Key Elements**: Suicidal ideation is explicit and persistent, but no evidence of actionable plans, preparations, or past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal thoughts"") and desire to die is strongly implied (""want to justify dying""). **Yes**.  
   - Emotional distress alone is insufficient; the explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond ""indicator.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned. ""Partially planning"" suggests contemplation but not concrete steps.

   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts"").  
   - Expressions of wanting to die are direct (""unbelievably suicidal"").  
   - Emotional context confirms severe distress but does not imply imminent action.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent are present. Focus is on enduring thoughts, not planning/acting.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No. The post discusses depression, anxiety, and needing therapy but contains no explicit or implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""end my life"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. The author expresses hopelessness (""I literally don’t even have the motivation to get up anymore"") and fear of judgment, but these are tied to seeking help, not suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No. No mention of methods (e.g., pills), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current struggles (e.g., inability to afford therapy) and future actions (telling parents). No references to past suicide attempts or self-harm actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post highlights severe distress and barriers to accessing therapy but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent** (required for *ideation*/*behavior*/*attempt*).  
   - General despair (e.g., ""fucked up self,"" ""no motivation"") and vague hardship align with **indicator**, as they show risk factors without suicidal desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and actively suppressing them.  
   - It references a specific suicide method (""putting eye drops in his beverages"") as a ""new suicide method"" inspired by a crime video.  
   - Emotional indicators include distress (""i wish i wasn't like this"") and internal conflict (""i really don’t want to have to do that"").  
   - No evidence of preparation, actions taken, imminent intent (e.g., timing like ""tonight""), or past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct use of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""suicide method.""  
   - **Yes**: Strongly implied desire to die via method ideation (""didn’t give me an idea of a new suicide method"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Method mentioned**: Eye drops as a suicide method.  
   - **No preparations/actions**: No tools gathered, locations scouted, or steps taken.  
   - **No imminent intent**: No time-bound language (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future** ideation (""i just saw a video... gave me an idea"").  
   - **No past attempts** described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal ideation (""suicidal thoughts"") and a specific method (eye drops) place this beyond *Indicator*.  
   - Lack of preparation, action, or imminent intent rules out *Behavior* and *Attempt*.  
   - Fits *Ideation*: Strong desire to die with a method identified, but no concrete steps toward execution.

214,"I think I've come to realize I'm the common denominator in all of my problems. A month ago I wrote a suicide note. I realized the date when I was going through my screenshots and found the note, primed and ready to be posted on social media so nobody wonders why I stopped responding to calls or going to work. Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""free myself of my problems,"" and ""nobody wonders why I stopped responding"" strongly imply suicidal intent and preparation for death.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The user explicitly mentions planning ""a time and place,"" preparing the note for social media posting, and describes self-sabotage during execution.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a past event (""a month ago"") where concrete actions were taken (writing the note, setting time/place). The phrase ""sabotaged myself"" confirms an incomplete attempt.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** with clear preparatory actions (note, timing, location) that was interrupted (""sabotaged myself""). This fits the *Attempt* definition: ""a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions."" Current ideation (""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"") does not override the classification, as the rules prioritize a described past attempt.

I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""I feel like I will never be loved,"" ""I am just a stain upon the world""), despair (""I feel so alone and forgotten""), and chronic emotional/physical pain (""all I can feel is tension and pain"").  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or strongly implied references to suicide, dying, or self-harm (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end it""). Phrases like ""the world would not change at all if I were gone"" and ""I am already just a fading memory"" reflect worthlessness and passive hopelessness but lack explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on ongoing suffering and past trauma (abuse, anxiety) but **no references to past suicide attempts or current plans**.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress, isolation, and worthlessness but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent** (e.g., wanting to die, plans, or actions).  
   - Falls under **Indicator** per definition: ""Vague references to death without a clear desire to die"" (e.g., ""if I were gone"") and ""severe hopelessness alone isn’t enough"" to qualify for higher-risk categories.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrases ""want to die"" and specific descriptions (""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself"") are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I'm done with life"") and self-blame (""all I cause is pain"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Two specific methods are named (""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself""), along with preparations (""get into my broken car,"" ""hang myself from a tree"") and imminent timing (""Tuesday"").
   - **Past Attempts/References**: None mentioned. Focus is on future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""want to die"") and strongly implied through method descriptions. **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods (slitting wrists, hanging) and actions (using a car, selecting a location) are detailed. Imminent timing (""Tuesday"") reinforces intent. **Yes**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to future plans (""Tuesday""), not past events. No history of attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Ideation** due to explicit methods, preparations, and imminent timing.  
   - It aligns with **Behavior**: suicidal intent + specific plan/method + preparation.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post directly states ""having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" and includes strong implications of wanting to die (e.g., ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (questioning life's purpose), emptiness, and guilt (calling suicide ""selfish"") are present but secondary to explicit suicidal ideation.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or actions are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent timing like ""tonight""). The author lists reasons *against* acting (e.g., concern for dog, friends, family).  
   - **Past Attempts**: No references to prior suicide attempts or actions.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on *current* thoughts (""I often feel,"" ""I’m having suicidal thoughts""), not past events.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses **suicidal thoughts and a desire to die** (""better if I was dead,"" ""Sign me up [for eternal sleep]"").  
   - However, it lacks **specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent** (e.g., no mention of pills, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - It also does **not describe past attempts**.  
   - Despite the author’s denial of depression and external stability, the explicit suicidal intent aligns with **Ideation** (thoughts/desires without concrete steps).  
   - Rules applied:  
     - Severe distress alone (e.g., hopelessness) would not suffice, but **explicit suicidal intent** elevates it beyond *Indicator*.  
     - Absence of plans/actions prevents classification as *Behavior* or *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The user explicitly states, ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there,"" directly referencing increased suicidal feelings.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong distress, paranoia, and trauma from past institutionalization are evident, but these support the explicit suicidal ideation.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, timelines (e.g., ""tonight""), preparations, or actions are mentioned. The focus is on avoiding intervention, not enacting self-harm.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The phrase ""made me 10x more suicidal"" refers to a current/persistent state of suicidal ideation triggered by past events (hospitalization). No past attempt is described—only the consequences of seeking help.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No. The explicit use of ""suicidal"" confirms active suicidal intent beyond vague distress.  
   - **Attempt?** No. No description of past/current self-harm actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I did"").  
   - **Behavior?** No. Absence of plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent.  
   - **Ideation?** Yes. The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""more suicidal"") without plans or actions. Trauma and fear of intervention contextualize but do not override the clear ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post states: ""I dont want to live anymore."" This is a **direct expression of not wanting to be alive**, implying a desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include distress (""This is not right"") and social withdrawal (""I just want be by myself""), but these are secondary to the explicit suicidal desire.  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions are mentioned.  
   - No references to past attempts or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I dont want to live anymore"" strongly implies a desire to die, aligning with suicidal ideation.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No methods or preparations** are mentioned. No imminent intent (e.g., ""now,"" ""tonight"") is indicated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The statement reflects **current/future intentions** (""I dont want to live anymore"") with no mention of past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die but lacks plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts. This fits the **Ideation** category (explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).  
   - *Why not other categories?*  
     - Not **Indicator**: Vague distress alone (e.g., ""This is not right"") would fit here, but the explicit ""I dont want to live anymore"" elevates it to Ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalents. References to death (""until I die"") are contextualized as hypothetical outcomes of neglect, not personal intent. Strong emotional distress (rage, hopelessness) is present, but suicidal desire is not explicitly stated or strongly implied (e.g., ""I’m trying to hold on"" counters intent).
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). Focus is on anger toward dismissive attitudes, not actionable plans.
   - **Temporal Context**: Discusses past neglect (""I DID ASK FOR HELP"") and hypothetical future scenarios (""until I die""), but no references to past attempts or current/future suicidal actions.
   - **Key Elements**: Primary themes are frustration with being labeled ""attention seeking,"" feeling unheard, and needing support. Emotional distress is severe but lacks direct expressions of self-harm or suicidal intent.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows **general distress** (hopelessness, rage, feeling neglected) but lacks explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die"" or ""I will end it"").
   - Vague references to death (""until I die"") are framed as others' anticipated reactions, not the user’s desire. The statement ""I’m trying to hold on"" reinforces a lack of active suicidal intent.
   - No evidence of plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts. Meets the **Indicator** definition: distress without clear suicidal intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References current state (""every day,"" ""now""). Past posts (""wrote here before"") discuss feelings, not attempts.  
   - **Verdict**: No past attempt described; focus is on imminent risk.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal ideation (""killing my self"") + specific preparations (note, bills) = **Behavior**.

""Shoot myself on the spot"" expresses a wish, not an active plan.
   - **Temporal Context**: References past actions (discarded suicide notes) and current/future desires (""wanna kill myself even more,"" ""wish I could shoot myself""), but no description of a concrete past attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. Direct expressions of suicidal intent are unambiguous.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods mentioned? Yes (""shoot myself,"" suicide notes).  
   - Preparations/actions? Past preparation (writing/discarding notes) but no *current* actions (e.g., acquiring tools).  
   - Imminent intent? No explicit timing (e.g., ""tonight""). ""On the spot"" reflects intensity, not immediacy.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past events: Discarded suicide notes (preparatory behavior).  
   - Current/future: Strong ideation (""wanna kill myself even more""). No past attempt described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Attempt**: Excluded—no description of a past suicide attempt (e.g., initiating self-harm).  
   - **Behavior vs. Ideation**:  
     - Suicidal intent is explicit, and methods are named (supports *Behavior*).  
     - However, preparatory actions (writing notes) are past and discarded, and there is no evidence of *current* planning, imminent intent, or active steps. The phrase ""shoot myself on the spot"" is hyperbolic expression of ideation, not a plan.  
     - **Conclusion**: Fits **Ideation**—strong, explicit suicidal thoughts with methods referenced but no active planning, preparation, or imminent intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post states ""Think I'm going to OD today"" and explicitly references ""suicide"" (""I've been thinking about suicide for a while"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Describes numbness (""I can't feel anything""), hopelessness (""it's all I can think about""), and persistent suicidal thoughts.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific methods are named (overdosing on ""venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal""). Preparations are implied (possession of a ""month's prescription""). Imminent intent is clear (""today"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future actions (""today"") and references past ideation (""thinking about suicide for a while""), but no past attempts are described.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent and plan.
   - **Ideation**: Insufficient, as the post goes beyond thoughts by detailing a method, preparations, and imminent timing.
   - **Behavior**: Fits best. The post combines explicit suicidal intent (""Think I'm going to OD today"") with a specific method (named medications), implied preparation (possession of pills), and imminent timing (""today"").
   - **Attempt**: Does not apply, as no past or in-progress attempt is described.

Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson. I'm sorry I wasn't a better person.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" strongly implies a desire for life to end, though it avoids explicit terms like ""suicide."" Direct expressions of despair (""I've got nothing left,"" ""completely used up"") and apologies/thank-yous (common in farewell notes) further support implied suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""nothing left""), guilt (""sorry I wasn't a better person""), and emotional exhaustion (""used up"") are present.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a will), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intent (""feels right now""), with no reference to past attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is **strongly implied** (""The end is the only thing that feels right now"") but not explicitly stated. Severe emotional distress + implied intent warrants moving beyond ""indicator.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific methods, preparations, or imminent timing** are indicated. The post expresses desire without actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to **current/future intentions** (""now""), not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a **strong desire to end life** with implied suicidal intent (""the end""), placing it beyond ""indicator.""  
   - Absence of plans/preparations rules out ""behavior"" or ""attempt.""  
   - **Fits ""ideation""**: Explicitly implied intent to die without concrete plans or actions.

Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I was already suicidal"" and ""shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" explicitly express suicidal intent and a desire to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe distress (""feel so bad,"" ""terrible terrible,"" ""overwhelmed,"" ""can't even cry"") and hopelessness are present.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The method ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific, violent means of self-harm/suicide.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Current/future intent (""all I want to do"" implies immediate desire). No past attempts described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly referenced (""suicidal"") and strongly implied (""cutting my god damn throat"" as a method to end life).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method is named (""cutting my throat""). No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), but the method is concrete and actionable.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes *current* suicidal urges (""all I want to do""), not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Ideation** due to the explicit method (""cutting my throat"").  
   - It aligns with **Behavior**: Suicidal intent + specific method (throat-cutting), even without confirmed preparation. The immediacy (""all I want to do"") reinforces this.  
   - No description of a past **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide via the quoted phrase: ""if you want to kill yourself.""  
   - Emotional context: The user shares a quote philosophically reframing suicidal thoughts (suggesting ""keep going"" due to life's meaninglessness) but does **not** express personal despair, hopelessness, or intent.  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or actions are described.  
   - No references to past attempts or imminent intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill yourself""), but it is **attributed to a quote**, not the user’s own statement. The user’s tone is curious/inquisitive (""Anyone know more about it?"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** methods, preparations, or imminent timing are present. The quote is abstract, and the user focuses on sourcing it.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The post discusses a **recently encountered quote**, not personal past/current experiences or intentions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The quote contains suicidal ideation, but **the user does not endorse or express personal suicidal intent**. They are neutrally sharing external content and seeking information.  
   - Lacks explicit/implicit desire to die, plans, actions, or references to attempts by the user.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: General reference to suicide without personal intent or emotional indicators of risk.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""i want to leave earth,"" ""always end up wanting to die,"" and ""ready to join my dog"" strongly imply a desire to end life. Emotional context includes hopelessness (""my life will never get better"") and resignation (""i give up on everything"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., gathering tools) are mentioned. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on recurring feelings (""always end up wanting to die"") and current despair (""now i’m ready""), but no description of past attempts or actions taken.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal intent (e.g., ""wanting to die,"" ""leave earth"") but lacks plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions.

I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct suicidal language (""I was going to kill myself"") and expresses a clear past desire to end life.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned. A timeframe (""before Christmas"") is noted, but no concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) or actions taken are described. The intent is explicitly aborted (""Now, I know I can't do that"").
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal thoughts are explicitly past-tense (""had previously made up my mind,"" ""was going to""). No current intent or active planning exists. The post emphasizes reflection and a decision against acting.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness is implied (e.g., ""Nothing has changed for me""), but the primary focus is on the resolution of suicidal intent due to newfound perspective.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator? No**. The explicit mention of suicidal intent (""kill myself"") rules this out.
   - **Attempt? No**. No description of a past concrete action (e.g., ""I tried to..."").
   - **Behavior? No**. While a timeframe exists, there is no method, preparation, or imminent intent. The plan was conceptual but never acted upon.
   - **Ideation? Yes**. The post clearly describes past suicidal thoughts and intent (""I was going to kill myself"") without evidence of actionable steps. The resolution reinforces this as ideation (thoughts without behavior).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct statements: ""serious thoughts about suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""commit suicide."" Strong emotional distress (anger, hopelessness) is tied explicitly to suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: The user mentions ""research[ing] easy painless ways to kill myself,"" indicating consideration of methods. However, no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparatory actions (e.g., acquiring tools) are described. Timing lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to recurring thoughts (e.g., ""for days"" in February, triggered during fights) and current ideation (""actually want to commit suicide""). No mention of past actions or attempts.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to commit suicide"") and research into methods align with **Ideation**, as there is no evidence of concrete plans, preparations, or actions taken.
   - ""Research[ing] ways to kill myself"" reflects exploration of methods but stops short of specifying a plan or acting (which would elevate to *Behavior*). Emotional triggers reinforce ideation without imminent intent.
   - Past events (February thoughts) are described as ideation, not attempts. Absence of preparatory actions or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") rules out *Behavior* or *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" (""Death and suicide need to be normalized"") and implies a desire to escape life (""Life is useless,"" ""something better on the other side"" without human suffering).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""Life is useless"") and escapism (idealizing a state without ""thought or human Emotions"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, actions, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to abstract concepts (normalizing suicide, afterlife) with no mention of past attempts or immediate intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly named (""suicide""), and the desire to escape life is strongly implied.  
   - **Verdict**: Yes (explicit + implied intent).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent actions are described.  
   - **Verdict**: No (lacks concrete steps).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on philosophical views (normalizing death/suicide) with no reference to past attempts or current/future plans.  
   - **Verdict**: Not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal ideation (""suicide,"" escapism) but lacks plans, actions, or references to attempts.  
   - **Indicator?** No: Explicit suicidal intent moves beyond vague distress.  
   - **Behavior/Attempt?** No: Absence of methods, preparations, or past actions.

232,Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?. To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight. Isn't it just beautiful?,0,indicator,"### Thinking Process  

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key elements**: The post romanticizes death as relief from pain (""never feel pain anymore""), escape from life's burdens (""never deal with the hassle""), and cessation of existence (""to be nothing""). It uses metaphors like ""black sea of infinity"" and ""let go after holding on so tight"" to convey surrender/despair.  
   - **Explicit suicide mentions**: No direct terms (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself""), but death is strongly implied as a desirable escape. Phrases like ""to never feel pain anymore"" and ""to be nothing"" express a clear wish to not be alive.  
   - **Plan/method identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent timing mentioned.  
   - **Temporal context**: Abstract/future-oriented (""Isn’t it just beautiful?""), no past actions or attempts.  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Profound hopelessness, exhaustion (""holding on so tight""), and idealization of death as peace.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No—vague distress alone would fit, but the post strongly implies a *desire for death* as relief, moving beyond general sadness.  
   - **Ideation?** **Yes**—death is explicitly framed as beautiful and freeing, expressing a passive wish to cease existing. No plans/actions elevate it further.  
   - **Behavior/Attempt?** No—no methods, preparations, or references to past/current actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct statements: ""if I'm positive, I’ll kill myself,"" ""I’ll use any method,"" and ""the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide."" Strong implied desire to die is also present (""I don’t see another day"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""my will to live is hanging by a thread""), isolation (""no one I can go to""), and despair (""it wouldn’t matter anymore"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method is named (e.g., pills, hanging), but the phrase ""use any method"" implies consideration of means. Critically, **imminent intent** is explicit: action is tied to a concrete trigger (""tomorrow"" after COVID results) with the declaration ""I’ll kill myself"" if positive.
   - **Temporal Context**: All references are future-oriented (""I’ll decide,"" ""if I’m positive, I’ll kill myself""). No mention of past attempts or actions.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent.
   - **Ideation**: Suicidal thoughts are present but insufficient due to imminent intent tied to a specific trigger (test results tomorrow).
   - **Behavior**: Fits best. The post expresses both explicit suicidal intent **and** imminent timing (""tomorrow"") with a conditional plan (suicide if COVID-positive). This demonstrates preparatory decision-making beyond passive ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""kill mslef"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent. Emotional distress (""burden,"" ""disappoinment,"" ""nobody else"") reinforces severe hopelessness.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The phrase ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" confirms a specific method (overdose) and concrete action taken. The statement ""and nothing"" implies the action was completed but ineffective.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a past action (""took..."") with ongoing intent (""What shoul i do kill mslef""). The ingestion of pills constitutes an initiated suicide attempt, even if incomplete.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** (ingesting zopiclone) that was incomplete (""and nothing""). This meets the definition of **Attempt**, which includes ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions."" 
   - Though current ideation is present (""What shoul i do kill mslef""), the clear description of a past attempt takes precedence per the rules: *""classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear.""*

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly states suicidal intent (""I might kill myself""), meeting the threshold for **ideation**.  
   - No plan, method, or preparatory action is described, ruling out **behavior** and **attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I'm going to end it tonight"" and ""I will be non existent"" explicitly express intent to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe distress and hopelessness are present (e.g., ""struggling with depression""), but suicidal intent is explicit.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are named (""extra strength Tylenol,"" ""Advil"") and timing is imminent (""tonight,"" ""in about a few minutes"").  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: None.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit expressions: ""end it,"" ""non existent"" → **Yes**.  
   - Direct desire to die: Strongly implied → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods: Pills (Tylenol/Advil) → **Yes**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit suicide mention: ""I want to kill myself"" is a direct statement of suicidal intent.

   - **Yes**: Strong implied desire to end life (""want to kill myself"" denotes active intent).  
   - *Conclusion*: Unambiguous suicidal intent elevates beyond ""indicator.""

   Yes. Multiple unambiguous declarations of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   Yes. A concrete timeline (""in two weeks"") is stated, signaling imminent intent. This elevates the risk beyond passive ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   The post describes a past attempt (October) and current/future intent (birthday in two weeks). The classification focuses on **current risk**, not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (explicit suicidal intent is present).  
   - It surpasses *Ideation* due to the specific plan with timing (""in two weeks""), placing it in *Behavior*.  
   - While a past attempt is mentioned, the **current declaration of imminent intent** dominates the risk assessment. *Behavior* captures active planning/preparation without completed action.  
   - *Attempt* is not applicable here, as no **recent/ongoing** suicidal action is described (the past attempt is historical).

From the time I realized that person that I really adored maybe is not toxic. but low key stupid and she don't deserve me, and from that moment it's a lot better.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide attempt"" (direct reference to past action), ""suicidal thoughts"" (explicitly stated, though noted as resolved).
   - Emotional indicators: Positive tone overall (e.g., ""celebrating,"" ""feel really good,"" ""thoughts kinda left""), with resolved distress.
   - Plans/methods: None mentioned for current state; past attempt referenced but no details provided.
   - Past events: Clear reference to a past suicide attempt (""one month from my last suicide attempt"") and overcoming suicidal ideation.
   - Current intent: No expressions of current desire, plan, or imminent risk; focus on recovery.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. ""Suicide attempt"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" are explicit.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No current plans or methods**. Past attempt is referenced without specifics; no imminent intent or preparations described for the present/future.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Past-focused**. The suicide attempt is explicitly stated as occurring one month ago (""last suicide attempt""). Current language emphasizes recovery, not active risk.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** (""last suicide attempt"") with no current behavior/ideation.  
   - Rules state: ""Classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear,"" even with resolved ideation.  
   - Positive recovery context does not override the explicit description of a past attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses severe emotional distress (e.g., ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""drowning in these awful thoughts,"" ""I'm so tired"").  
   - Mentions hopelessness (e.g., ""I don't have anyone I can reach out to"") and impaired functioning (e.g., inability to sleep, guilt over self-care).  
   - Explicitly states: ""I don’t have a plan to hurt myself,"" ruling out active planning or preparation.  
   - No explicit or implied references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, past attempts, methods, timelines, or actions taken.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**: No terms like ""suicide,"" ""die,"" or strong implications of ending life (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). Distress is present, but intent is absent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No methods, preparations, imminent intent, or actions described. The phrase ""I don’t have a plan to hurt myself"" explicitly negates this.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current emotional state; no references to past attempts or future intentions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Fits **Indicator**: The post shows profound distress, hopelessness, and fear but lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent, plans, or behaviors. General ""awful thoughts"" without suicidal specificity align with vague distress (per Indicator definition).

241,"I'm so afraid to die but I fucking hate being alive. Yesterday my mom woke me up after work and I was having a dream and after I woke up I felt so fucking angry. I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - Direct expressions of wanting to die: ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time.""  
     - Strong implications of suicidal desire: ""I’m so afraid to die but I fucking hate being alive"" and ""reverse time"" (implying escape from existence).  
     - **Verdict**: Yes.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**:  
     - Profound hopelessness (""I don't wanna play video games or watch movies...""), self-loathing (""I fucking hate myself""), isolation, and despair.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) mentioned.  
     - No preparations or actions taken (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes).  
     - Self-harm ideation (""imagine myself amputating parts of my body"") is acknowledged but explicitly stated as non-acted upon (""I’ve never purposely hurt myself"").  
     - No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  
     - **Verdict**: No.  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Suicidal thoughts are current (""every fucking day"").  
     - Past hospitalization for depression is noted, but no past suicide attempts described.  
     - Self-harm fantasies are hypothetical, not behavioral.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit and persistent suicidal desire** (""I want to die,"" ""think about dying every day"") but lacks:  
     - Specific plans, methods, or preparatory actions.  
     - References to past attempts.  
     - Imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Self-harm imagery is ideational (internal fantasies) without behavioral follow-through.  
   - **Severe emotional distress** (e.g., self-hatred, hopelessness) is present but elevates to **Ideation** due to explicit suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The post describes severe depression, emotional pain causing physical symptoms (muscle aches, exhaustion), hopelessness (""everything is exhausting""), and feelings of bodily collapse (""my own body is giving up"").
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""**i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight**"" strongly implies a desire to die. While not using words like ""suicide,"" it explicitly expresses a wish for death through passive means (dying in sleep).  
     - *Explicit/Implied Intent*: **Yes** (desire not to wake up).  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparation (e.g., gathering tools) is mentioned. The wish for death in sleep is passive and lacks actionable steps.  
     - *Method/Preparation*: **No**.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The desire (""tonight"") is future-oriented but hinges on a passive outcome (death during sleep), not active intent. No reference to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** due to explicit desire to die (""hoping i will die""), moving beyond general distress.  
   - It aligns with **Ideation**: Strong suicidal desire is present (""die in my sleep""), but there is no plan, method, preparation, or active behavior (e.g., ""I will take pills tonight""). The passive hope for death, without concrete steps, fits Ideation’s scope.  
   - **Behavior** is ruled out due to absence of plans/preparations. **Attempt** is inapplicable as no past/current action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The term ""overdose"" combined with ""wasn't enough to kill me"" explicitly implies intent to die by suicide.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific method (Zoloft pills), dosage (300mg), and timing (11:30) are stated, along with the action taken (""I took 6 pills"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a **past event** (action completed at 11:30) with immediate consequences (current nausea/sweating). The phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" confirms a completed action with suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Not the primary focus; the core is the description of a concrete suicidal action.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** (taking 300mg of Zoloft) with clear suicidal intent, even though the outcome was non-fatal. This fits the **Attempt** category definition: ""describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete actions."" The mention of current symptoms does not override the clear evidence of an initiated attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""destined to do it,"" ""no way I’m living,"" and ""hope my plan works"" strongly imply suicidal intent and a desire to end life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The author expresses calmness (""I feel so calm"") and acceptance (""at peace""), indicating resolve rather than despair alone.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The phrase ""hope my plan works"" confirms a specific, undisclosed method exists. Imminent timing (""knowing it’s soon"") reinforces intent.  
   - **Past Attempts/Preparations**: No mention of past actions or attempts.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on future intentions (""soon""), not past events.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is strongly implied (e.g., ""destined to do it,"" ""no way I’m living""). **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A plan is explicitly referenced (""hope my plan works""), and intent is imminent (""soon""). **Yes**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (explicit intent exists) and *Ideation* (specific plan and imminent timing are present).  
   - It does not describe a past action, so *Attempt* is inapplicable.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum"" explicitly references suicide, indicating a desire to engage with self-harm content.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""Hopeless... realizing you're hopeless is too much""), despair, and self-blame (""it's me"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent actions (e.g., tools, timing, steps taken). Seeking a forum implies research but not concrete plans.
   - **Temporal Context**: Describes ongoing feelings (""months"") and current hopelessness. No reference to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit mention: **Yes** (""suicide forum"").  
   - Desire to die/not be alive: **Implied** (seeking a suicide forum indicates intent).  
   - Emotional context reinforces intent (rejecting hope, emphasizing hopelessness).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). Stays at ideation level.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current emotional state. No past attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent moves it beyond **Indicator**.  
   - Absence of plans/preparations rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Strong suicidal desire with no actionable steps aligns with **Ideation**.

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""I'm disgusting,"" ""how low my expectations""), hopelessness (""idc just want an end""), and loneliness (""no one responds"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The method ""slash my wrists"" is specified, and imminent intent is indicated by ""on the verge of trying.""
   - **Temporal Context**: Current/future intentions (""I'm just on the verge of trying""). No past attempts described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""die"") and strongly implied (""just want an end"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (""idc just want an end"").  
   - **Conclusion**: Strong evidence for suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: ""slash my wrists.""  
   - Imminent intent: ""on the verge of trying"" implies immediate risk.  
   - **Conclusion**: Meets criteria for ""behavior"" (specific method + imminent timing).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current/future actions (""I'm on the verge""), not past events.  
   - No mention of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes **explicit suicidal intent** (""die,"" ""want an end"") and a **specific method** (""slash my wrists"") with **imminent timing** (""on the verge"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone"" explicitly express a desire to die to end suffering.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned. Mentioning funeral costs (""ill fix all of the funeral costs"") implies preparation for death but lacks concrete suicidal actions (e.g., acquiring tools).  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intent (""I cannot wait to die"") without references to past attempts.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""life is not able to be fixed""), rejection of support (""bullshit phrase""), and isolation.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses an **explicit desire to die** (""I cannot wait to die"") to escape pain, fitting *Ideation*.  
   - Funeral costs indicate **preparations**, but these are logistical (post-death arrangements) rather than active steps toward suicide (e.g., ""I bought a rope""). Without a specific method, imminent timing (""tonight""), or description of past/current actions, it does not escalate to *Behavior* or *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""destined to live a depressed life""), despair (""summer of my life is over""), and perceived irreversible loss (""everything that made my happiness has now left me""). Vague existential questioning (""what's really the point?"").
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: **No explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent** (e.g., no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or phrases like ""I want to die""). The post focuses on comparative suffering (past vs. future) and seeks wisdom/support.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: **No specific methods, preparations, or imminent intent** (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Discusses past happiness and current/future hopelessness. **No references to past attempts or actions**.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide not mentioned or strongly implied. Emotional distress is present but lacks intent to die (e.g., ""what's the point?"" is existential, not suicidal).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

   - **Verdict**: Not applicable to *attempt*.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Fits **Indicator**: The post expresses severe hopelessness and distress but lacks explicit/implied suicidal desire, plans, or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly discusses suicide by asking which NYC bridge would provide ""the highest chance of death"" and states, ""I’m gonna pick one by the weekend."" Phrases like ""wish me luck hopefully everything pans out the way I want"" strongly imply intent to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Desperation and isolation (""I doubt anyone will answer me"") are present, but the suicidal intent is explicit.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method (jumping from a bridge) is mentioned, along with preparation (researching bridges for lethality) and a clear timeframe (""by the weekend"").
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes current/future intentions (""I’m gonna pick one by the weekend""), not past events. No mention of prior attempts.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond passive thoughts (Ideation) due to the **specific method** (jumping from a bridge) and **preparatory actions** (researching bridges). The imminent timeframe (""by the weekend"") confirms intent. This aligns with the **Behavior** category, defined as suicidal ideation with a plan/preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or strong implication of suicidal intent (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""die,"" ""end my life""). Phrases like ""I will never die"" and ""I will never be free"" paradoxically emphasize *enduring* suffering, not ending life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I am here to live in pain""), despair (""The pain will never loosen its grip""), and isolation (""I supposed to be an alien"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., tools, timelines, actions).  
   - **Temporal Context**: No references to past attempts or future plans. Focuses on existential despair, not actionable intent.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses severe distress and hopelessness but lacks **explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent** required for ""Ideation"" or beyond.  
   - Vague references to suffering (e.g., ""I will never be free"") align with ""Indicator,"" which captures distress without suicidal thoughts/actions.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - The user states: ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from."" This strongly implies a desire for permanent escape (equivalent to death).  
     - Other phrases like ""it would be a welcome end to everything"" and questioning ""why bother going through all of it?"" further signal a desire to cease living.  
     - **Conclusion**: Yes, suicidal intent is strongly implied.  

   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons) are mentioned.  
     - No descriptions of preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  
     - Past attempt (""aborted attempt at suicide 6 years ago"") is referenced but not current.  
     - **Conclusion**: No evidence of active planning or preparatory behavior.  

   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Desires for death (""welcome end"") and struggle (""hard to turn away"") reflect **current/future** ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" strongly implies suicidal intent (""doing it"" is a common euphemism for suicide). The apology (""I’m sorry... you must understand it’s for the best"") reinforces a desire to end life.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""no hope anymore""), emotional numbness (""no emotion anymore""), and despair (""no matter how hard I struggle... it doesn’t matter"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method (""in the tub"") and preparation considerations (""less of a mess"") are mentioned.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes current/future intent (""I plan on doing it""), not past actions. No reference to prior attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is strongly implied (""doing it"" + context of hopelessness). **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (bathtub) and implicit preparation (minimizing mess) are stated. **Yes**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""I plan on...""), not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (explicit intent is present) and *Ideation* (due to the specific plan/method).  
   - It aligns with **Behavior**: Suicidal intent is explicit (""doing it""), and a concrete method/preparation (""in the tub,"" ""less mess"") is described.  
   - It is not *Attempt*, as no past or ongoing action is reported.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit suicide mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""END IT"" (common suicide euphemism) and ""wanting to end it"" strongly imply suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""Life is miserably unfair""), despair (""I’m sick of being epileptic...""), loneliness (""ostracized from an early age""), and trauma.  
   - **Plan/method identification**: Mentions actions taken: self-harm via medication misuse (""Taking pain killers and antidepressants... led to my addiction to paracetamols""), resulting in physical harm (liver damage, vomiting, starvation).

   - **References to Past Attempts**: None. The post describes future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""offing myself"") and strongly implied (""going out of this world""). Emotional context (worthlessness, despair) reinforces intent. **Answer: Yes**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Direct statements include ""I want to kill myself so bad"" and ""I just want to die peacefully."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""I’m so fucking done,"" ""I hate this world""), hopelessness (""It will never be better""), and shame (""I dont want to feel like piece of shit anymore"") are present but are secondary to explicit suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, gathering tools) are mentioned. The reference to getting drunk is a coping behavior, not a suicide method.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intent (e.g., ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" ""It will never be better"") with no mention of past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself,"" ""die peacefully"") → **Yes**.  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") → **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes current/future suicidal desire → **Not past events**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post contains **explicit suicidal intent** (""I want to kill myself"") but lacks any specific plan, method, preparation, or reference to past actions. This aligns with the **Ideation** category (suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).  
   - It does not meet the threshold for *Behavior* (requires plans/actions) or *Attempt* (requires past actions). Emotional distress alone is insufficient for *Indicator* due to explicit suicidal statements.

**1. CONTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Key elements**:  
  - Explicit mentions: No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
  - Strong implications: ""Everyone would be happier without me"" strongly implies suicidal intent (desire to be gone/dead to relieve others). ""I have to make it stop"" implies ending existence as a solution to suffering.

  - Plans/methods: No specific methods, preparations, locations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  
  - Past attempts: None referenced.  

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**  
- Strongly implied desire to die: **Yes** (""Everyone would be happier without me"" = desire to be dead).  
- Direct expressions of not wanting to be alive: **Yes** (""I have to make it stop"" in context of removing self).  

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The statement ""I would have done it already if I wasn’t so afraid of botching it"" explicitly references suicidal intent and consideration of an attempt. Phrases like ""I don’t belong here"" and ""nothing is better than this"" strongly imply a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I don’t have anything to look forward to""), self-loathing (""I hate myself""), and isolation (""lost and alone"") are present.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method, preparation, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned. Fear of ""botching"" an attempt indicates contemplation of methods but no concrete plan or action.
   - **Temporal Context**: References to suicide are hypothetical/future-oriented (""I would have done it..."") with no description of past attempts or actions taken.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal intent** (""I would have done it already"") and a **persistent desire to die** (""nothing is better than this""), meeting the threshold for *ideation*.

   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The user states: ""I don't want to live,"" ""I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life,"" and explicitly says, ""I would say I'm suicidal."" These are strong expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""I feel like a waste of space""), worthlessness (""failure to my son""), and despair (""life is too much"") are present but secondary to explicit suicidal statements.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The user explicitly rules out immediate action (""I don't have the balls to actually do it"") and defers intent to a distant future (""wait till he's an adult"").
   - **Temporal Context**: All suicidal expressions refer to current/future ideation (""I would say I'm suicidal"") with no references to past attempts or actions taken.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I'm suicidal"") but lacks any specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions. The deferral of intent (""wait till he's an adult"") and self-described inability to act (""I don't have the balls"") confirm the absence of behavioral elements. This aligns with the **Ideation** category, defined as expressions of suicidal desire without concrete plans or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, phrases like ""I just want off this life"" strongly imply a desire to escape existence, aligning with implied suicidal intent (Yes to implied expressions).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Clear hopelessness (""struggling to hold on,"" ""depressed and feeling like shit for years""), despair, and emotional exhaustion.
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: No specific methods (e.g., pills), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") mentioned.
   - **Past Attempts**: No references to prior suicide attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Implied desire to die (""want off this life"") is present, but no explicit terminology. Strong emotional distress with implied intent elevates this beyond vague distress.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Absent. No methods, preparations, or imminent timing indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/persistent feelings (""for years & years""), not past actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a **strong implied desire to end life** (""want off this life"") paired with hopelessness, fitting **Ideation**.  
   - Lacks plans, methods, or actions for **Behavior/Attempt**. General distress alone would be ""Indicator,"" but implied suicidal intent moves this to **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I need to kill myself"" directly state suicidal intent. The post also implies a desire to die (""life just isn’t worth it"") and expresses severe hopelessness.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. Descriptions of despair (""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore""), guilt (""terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family""), and isolation reinforce distress.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No. While the user asks how to ""minimise the amount that I hurt my family,"" there is **no mention** of a specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), preparation (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. The post discusses current feelings only, with no mention of prior actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit statement: ""I need to kill myself"" → **Yes**.  
   - Strongly implied desire to die: ""life just isn’t worth it"" → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method mentioned? → **No**.  
   - Preparations/actions described? → **No**.  
   - Imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"")? → **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future intentions** (""I need to kill myself""), with no reference to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post **explicitly expresses suicidal intent** (""I need to kill myself"") and desire to die (""life just isn’t worth it""), satisfying the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - It lacks a concrete plan, method, preparation, or imminent timing, ruling out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/initiated actions, ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - While distress and hopelessness are present, explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. ""I'll be gone"" strongly implies a desire to end life, paired with statements like ""no possible way to turn my life around"" and ""no point in trying anymore."" This conveys explicit suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""no point in trying""), despair (""tired of fighting""), and entrapment (""cycle I can’t escape"") are present but secondary to the suicidal implication.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) is mentioned. The temporal reference (""by next week"") suggests intent but lacks concrete actions or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on future intent (""I’ll be gone by next week"") with no reference to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is strongly implied (""I’ll be gone"") with expressions of wanting to die (""no point in trying""). **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"") are described. **No**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Future-oriented intent only. No past attempts referenced. **No**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I’ll be gone"") but lacks specific plans, methods, or preparations. This aligns with **Ideation**, which covers explicit/implied suicidal thoughts without concrete steps. The future timing (""next week"") does not imply imminent action without a method, ruling out ""Behavior.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct expressions of suicidal intent: ""I hope I don't make it,"" ""I don't want to survive another attempt,"" and ""I just want to die.""  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (fear of parental criticism about medical bills) and despair.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method, preparation, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned for a future attempt.  
   - **Past Attempts**: Explicit reference to a prior suicide attempt (""another attempt""). The phrase ""survive another attempt"" confirms a concrete past action with suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied (""I just want to die"") and explicitly referenced via ""another attempt."" **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No current plan, method, or preparation described. Focus is on avoiding survival of a past event. **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The post references a **past suicide attempt** (""another attempt""). The desire to avoid surviving ""another attempt"" implies this is retrospective.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** (""another attempt""), which fits the ""Attempt"" category (defined as describing past attempts, including incomplete ones).  
   - While there is current ideation (""I just want to die""), the clear acknowledgment of a prior attempt takes precedence per the rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"" and strongly implies a desire to die with phrases like ""death is the only escape."" This indicates clear suicidal intent beyond vague distress.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. The author expresses hopelessness (""too far gone,"" ""no escape from the everlasting flames of life"") and escalating distress (""thoughts are intense and only getting more intense"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight""). The focus is on thoughts, not actions.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. The post describes current ideation only, with no mention of prior suicide attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal thoughts"") and strongly implied (""death is the only escape""). The emotional context (hopelessness, intense distress) reinforces suicidal intent. **Result: Yes, moving beyond 'indicator'**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing are described. The escalation of thoughts (""only getting more intense"") does not equate to concrete steps. **Result: No plan or behavior present**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The post refers to current/future experiences (e.g., ""as the days pass,"" waking with thoughts). There are no references to past attempts. **Result: Current ideation only**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""death is the only escape""), meeting the criteria for **Ideation**. However, it lacks plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions, ruling out **Behavior** or **Attempt**. General distress and hopelessness alone would not qualify for **Indicator** due to the explicit suicidal intent.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit suicide mentions: Yes (""suicidal stuff,"" ""attempt,"" ""intention of dying"").
   - Emotional indicators: Distress, guilt (""bothered me afterwards""), isolation (""only one that knows"").
   - Plan/method: References testing a method and reaching ""the point of no return"" (implied preparatory actions).
   - Past actions: Describes two concrete events:  
     - First: Testing a method until ""shortly before the point of no return.""  
     - Second: Acting with ""intention of dying"" but stopping.  
   - Temporal context: Both events occurred in the past (""long enough ago,"" ""past year or two"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. Direct terms like ""suicidal stuff"" and ""attempt"" are used. Intent to die is explicitly stated for the second event.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   Yes. Actions involve testing a method and progressing to a critical threshold (""point of no return""), indicating preparation and rehearsal.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   Past events only. Both incidents are framed as historical, with no current/imminent intent expressed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes **past concrete actions** initiated with suicidal intent (method testing + intentional progression toward death).  
   - Stopping before completion aligns with the ""Attempt"" definition (incomplete/self-interrupted actions).  
   - Rules prioritize ""Attempt"" when past attempts are clearly described, even if current ideation is absent.  
   - ""Behavior"" is less fitting, as the focus is on recounting completed actions (not plans/preparations for the future).

I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post includes the direct statement: ""I really want to die."" This is an explicit expression of suicidal intent. Phrases like ""I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them"" or ""I'd rather die than submit to anyone"" reinforce despair but are less direct. The core statement (""I really want to die"") is unambiguous.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""nothing ever gets better""), self-loathing (""I am the one ruining my own life""), trauma (abuse, bullying), and isolation (""no human being is to be trusted"") are present but secondary to the explicit suicidal expression.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The focus is on emotional suffering, not actionable steps.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions. The post discusses historical trauma (e.g., parental beatings) but not personal suicide actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. ""I really want to die"" is a direct, unambiguous statement of suicidal desire.  
   - **Yes**. Additional phrases (e.g., ""I'd rather die"") support implied intent but are less critical given the explicit core statement.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No methods, preparations, or imminent timing are described. The post centers on emotional pain, not concrete plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future intentions** (""I really want to die"") and **past trauma** (abuse, bullying). No references to past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit statement ""I really want to die"" confirms active suicidal thoughts, placing this beyond **Indicator** (which requires no explicit/implied intent).  
   - Absence of methods, preparations, or past attempts rules out **Behavior** (requires plans/actions) and **Attempt** (requires past concrete actions).  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die without plans, methods, or actions.

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I still am the same person with the same head""), loneliness, and distress about carrying this burden alone for seven years.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Mentions writing ""detailed plans"" in a journal and frequent internal conversations about suicide, but no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or actionable preparation (e.g., acquiring tools) is described. The user explicitly states, ""I know I would never do it,"" due to fear of hell.
   - **Temporal Context**: All references are to ongoing, current thoughts (e.g., ""every day,"" ""once a week""). No past attempts are described.
   - **Intent**: While suicidal thoughts are frequent and intense, the user denies imminent intent (""I know I would never do it"") and expresses a desire for help.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal,"" ""suicide"") and strongly implied through journaling about plans.  
   - Expressions of wanting to die are present but countered by self-deterrence (fear of consequences).

   - Focuses entirely on persistent current ideation (daily/weekly). No past attempts or actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal language and detailed ideation.  
   - **Behavior**: Ruled out. Despite journaling ""plans,"" there is no evidence of actionable steps (e.g., acquiring means), imminent intent, or self-harm actions.  
   - **Attempt**: Ruled out. No past or current suicide actions described.  
   - **Ideation**: Fits best. The post centers on active, frequent suicidal thoughts (""think about suicide every day"") and cognitive planning (journaling), but explicitly rejects intent to act and lacks behavioral escalation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key Elements**: The post expresses emotional distress (""I cant take it anymore"") and intense suffering (""The pain is unreal""), accompanied by a sad emoticon.  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""end my life,"" or ""be gone""). The distress is severe but lacks suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes current emotional pain without references to past attempts or future plans.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows **general distress and hopelessness** but lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent, plans, or actions.  
   - Fits the **Indicator** category: Vague expressions of overwhelm (""can’t take it anymore"") and pain without a clear desire to die or actionable steps.  
   - Does not meet thresholds for *Ideation* (no suicidal thoughts), *Behavior* (no plan/action), or *Attempt* (no past/current attempt described).

277,"Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post directly states ""commiting suicide,"" which is an explicit reference. The phrase ""capable of commiting suicide sober"" implies a current self-perceived ability to act on suicidal thoughts.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Indirect hopelessness/despair is present (linking sobriety to suicide capability), but this is secondary to the explicit suicidal intent.
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: No specific method, plan, preparations, or actions are mentioned. Words like ""capable"" suggest potential but not imminent action.
   - **Past Attempts/References**: No references to past attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""commiting suicide"").  
   - Desire/capability to die is strongly implied (""capable of commiting suicide"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are specified.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current capability, not past actions or future plans with immediacy.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal intent and self-perceived capability but lacks concrete plans, methods, preparations, or references to past/ongoing actions.  
   - This aligns with **Ideation** (explicit suicidal thoughts without actionable steps).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrases ""I just want it to be over"" and ""I want to be done"" are strong implications of suicidal intent (e.g., desiring an end to life). Emotional indicators like self-loathing (""I'm a piece of shit""), loneliness (""I don't want to be alone anymore""), and hopelessness (""I hate every part of my life"") reinforce severe distress with suicidal desire.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on **current** feelings (e.g., ""I want,"" ""I hate""). No references to past actions or attempts (e.g., ""I tried"") are present.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal desire** (""I just want it to be over"") but lacks any concrete plan, method, or action. This aligns with the **Ideation** category (suicidal thoughts without steps toward action).  
   - It does not qualify as:
     - **Indicator**: Vague distress (e.g., ""life isn’t worth living"") is absent; suicidal intent is strongly implied.
     - **Behavior**: No plans, methods, or preparatory actions are described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide 11 times,"" confirming past suicidal actions. Phrases like ""I will use my suicide"" imply future intent but lack specificity about timing or method.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Anger and resentment (""I hate capitalism and everyone complicit"") are present, but these are secondary to the explicit suicide references.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method, preparation, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned for future actions.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post directly references **past events** (""I have attempted suicide 11 times""). The phrase ""I will use my suicide"" suggests future intent but lacks concrete plans or actions.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core of the post centers on **past suicide attempts** (""attempted suicide 11 times""). This is a clear, self-reported history of initiated suicidal actions.
   - Under the **Attempt** category definition, any description of past suicide attempts (including incomplete or interrupted ones) qualifies, regardless of additional ideation or ideological context.
   - The user's statements about future intent (""I will use my suicide..."") are vague and lack specificity about methods, preparations, or immediacy. They do not override the concrete evidence of past attempts.
   - Rules emphasize that if a past attempt is described, classify as **Attempt**, even if current ideation is present.

The most fucked up thing is I still think about her every day. I've been in 2 short relationships since, but still, my mind won't let me forget her. Tried to kill myself 3 times by now. I've just given up completely. I just want the pain to end. I don't recognise myself any more",3,attempt,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"" explicitly references suicide.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""Welcome to the bottom of hell""), hopelessness (""I've just given up completely""), and emotional pain (""I just want the pain to end"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific current methods, plans, or preparations are mentioned. References to suicide are retrospective.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: Explicitly states past actions: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now,"" indicating completed suicide attempts (even if interrupted or incomplete).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. ""Tried to kill myself"" is an unambiguous declaration of suicidal action.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   No current plan, method, or imminent intent described. All suicidal references are to **past events**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   The phrase ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"" confirms **past attempts**. No current/future intent is indicated beyond a general desire to end pain.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes concrete past suicide attempts (""tried to kill myself 3 times""), satisfying the **Attempt** definition.  
   - While there is current distress (""I just want the pain to end""), it lacks a specific plan or imminent intent, so it does not override the clear evidence of past attempts.  
   - Rules prioritize classifying as **Attempt** when past suicide actions are explicitly stated.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes explicit discussions of death and suicide methods (e.g., ""accomplish death,"" ""shooting myself through my upper palate,"" ""failed suicide,"" ""End it now""). Strong emotional despair (e.g., ""I’m in hell,"" ""It doesn’t get better,"" ""never ending pain"") reinforces suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are detailed (e.g., shotguns, handguns, caliber considerations, overdose) along with fears of failed outcomes (e.g., paralysis). Preparatory research is implied (""I’ve looked into other options"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intent (e.g., ""End it now,"" fears about methods). No past attempts described—only hypothetical or research-based scenarios.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Extreme hopelessness, isolation, physical/emotional pain, and rejection of help (e.g., ""no miracle is coming"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied (""accomplish death,"" ""End it now"") and explicitly discussed (methods, outcomes).  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""End it now"" as self-directed urgency).  
   - **Verdict**: Yes, unambiguous suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods named (firearms, overdose).  
   - Preparation/research evident (e.g., evaluating calibers, considering Mark Linkous’s case).  
   - Imminent intent implied (""End it now"").  
   - **Verdict**: Concrete plans and imminent intent elevate beyond ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Concerns current/future actions (e.g., ""End it now,"" method fears).  
   - No reference to past attempts—only hypothetical failures.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out—explicit suicidal intent and methods dominate.  
   - **Ideation**: Insufficient—specific plans/methods and imminent intent (""End it now"") exceed passive thoughts.  
   - **Behavior**: Fits—detailed methods, research, and urgency indicate concrete steps toward action.  
   - **Attempt**: Not applicable—no description of past or initiated actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is **not explicitly mentioned** (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - **Strongly implied desire to die**: ""never ever wake up"" conveys a clear wish to cease existing.  
   - **Result**: Implied intent qualifies for ideation over indicator.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No methods** (e.g., pills, jumping) or **preparations** described.  
   - **No imminent intent** (e.g., timing like ""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over.

I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people.

   - **Plan or Method**: Yes. The car-crash scenario serves as a specific method (""crashing into another car""). The post describes recurring near-actions (""frequently come close to doing it""), indicating behavioral engagement.
   - **Temporal Context**: Current/future intent (""want to stop,"" ""come close to doing it""). No past attempts are mentioned—only consideration halted by fear of survival (""afraid I won’t die on impact"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is strongly implied through the crash metaphor. **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (intentional car crash) and recurring near-actions (""come close to doing it"") indicate behavioral elements. **Yes**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes current urges and near-actions, not past attempts. **Current/future intent**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (explicit intent present) and *Ideation* (method and near-actions described).  
   - It aligns with **Behavior**: Suicidal intent + specific method (car crash) + preparations (repeated near-actions). Fear of failed outcomes prevents an actual attempt, but behavioral criteria are met.  
   - Not *Attempt*, as no concrete past/current action occurred (""never can [do it]"").

My job and parents abuse me too. I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post contains the explicit statement ""I'm going to kill myself,"" which directly expresses a desire to end life. The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" strongly implies inevitability and intent (Yes to both explicit/implicit questions).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The post describes ""empty loneliness,"" exhaustion (""so tired""), and abuse from job/parents, indicating severe distress.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) is mentioned. The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" suggests future intent but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete actions.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on current/future intentions (""I'm going to..."") with no reference to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself""), and intent is strongly implied (""Only a matter of when""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are present. This rules out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - No past attempts or actions described. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal intent (""I'm going to kill myself"") and a future-oriented desire to die (""Only a matter of when""). However, it lacks specific plans, methods, or preparatory actions. This aligns with **Ideation**, which covers explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete steps.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses death as a passive ""option"" and questions whether merely considering it qualifies as a suicidal thought.  
   - Explicitly states, ""**I won't commit**,"" rejecting active intent.  
   - Hypothetical scenarios (e.g., dying in an accident) are mentioned, but these lack personal agency or desire.  
   - Emotional tone reflects resignation (""not the worst outcome""), not explicit despair or intent to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No explicit mentions** (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - **No strong implications** of wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). Phrases like ""death is an option"" are vague and theoretical.  
   - Emotional context shows detachment, not intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No methods** (e.g., pills, jumping) discussed.  
   - **No preparations or actions** described (e.g., acquiring tools).  
   - **No imminent intent** (e.g., ""tonight""); scenarios are hypothetical and non-actionable.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current philosophical contemplation**, not past actions (""I won't commit"") or future plans.  
   - **No references to past attempts**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Falls under **Indicator**:  
     - Lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent or desire to die.  
     - Expresses passive resignation about death (""not the worst outcome"") but explicitly rejects action (""I won't commit"").  
     - Aligns with the example: General distress about life’s hardships without suicidal intent.  
   - Does **not** qualify for higher categories:  
     - *Ideation* requires explicit desire to die (absent here).  
     - *Behavior* requires plans/preparation (none present).  
     - *Attempt* requires past actions (not referenced).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""finally kill me"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent. ""Tonight is the last chance"" implies imminent action.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""I wish I didn’t have to do this"") and resolve (""I’m doing the right after all"") are present, but the explicit suicidal intent dominates.
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: Yes. ""I even have the stuff prepared"" confirms concrete preparations, though the method is unspecified. The phrase ""planned this"" and urgency (""tonight"") signal imminent intent.
   - **Past Attempts**: No reference to prior suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Suicide explicitly mentioned/strongly implied?** Yes (""kill me"").  
   - **Expressions of wanting to die?** Yes (""kill me,"" ""last chance"").  
   - **Emotional context**: Severe distress with explicit intent, moving beyond vague indicators.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method?** Unspecified (""stuff prepared""), but preparations are confirmed.  
   - **Preparations/actions taken?** Yes (""stuff prepared"").  
   - **Imminent intent?** Yes (""tonight""). This strongly leans toward 'behavior' due to readiness and urgency.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Past events?** No attempt described; only future intent (""tonight,"" ""last chance"").  
   - **Current/future intentions?** Dominant focus on immediate action (""tonight"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent (""kill me"") + preparations (""stuff prepared"") + imminent timing (""tonight"") align with the **Behavior** category. The post bridges ideation (desire to die) with actionable steps (preparation/urgency), ruling out Indicator (no explicit intent) and Ideation (no plan/preparation). No past attempt is described, excluding Attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or strongly implied suicidal language (e.g., ""die,"" ""suicide,"" ""end my life""). Phrases like ""I don’t always wish to be gone"" are vague and non-committal, framed as a fluctuating feeling rather than intent. Emotional distress (loneliness, confusion, terror) is present but lacks suicidal implication.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No mention of methods, preparations, or actions. No imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on past hardships (""dragged my face through the mud"") and ongoing emotional struggles, but no references to past attempts or future plans. The phrase ""I don’t always wish to be gone"" suggests intermittent passive thoughts, not active intent.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and loneliness but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent** (e.g., no desire to die, no plans). Vague references to ""wish to be gone"" are counterbalanced by resilience (""I’m still standing"") and a plea for connection (""I just hope I’m not alone"").  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Distress without suicidal intent, as per the definition. Emotional pain alone is insufficient for higher categories without clear suicidal ideation or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes the direct statement ""I'm depressed constantly, **suicidal**, and lonely."" It also implies a desire to escape life (""wish I could restart,"" ""wish I wasn’t so broken"") and references the impact of ""my death"" on the sibling.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""Why push on when you barely have anything to look forward to?""), despair (""destroyed myself""), shame (""pathetic""), and loneliness.

   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on **current** feelings (""I feel,"" ""I’m depressed""). No references to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit use of ""suicidal"" and references to death confirm **active suicidal intent**, moving beyond vague distress (Indicator).  
   - No evidence of plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") rules out Behavior.

While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:

     - ""Recently, I’ve been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself"" (explicit desire to die).  
     - ""Therefore it is probably best I head out before it gets worse"" (strongly implied intent).  
     - **Verdict**: Yes, explicit and implied expressions of suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Direct expressions of intent to die and active self-harm.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. Specific method (cutting radial artery), tools (dremel with saw attachment), and preparation (research, marking). Imminent timing confirmed (""too late"" upon posting).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

Is it better to be honest or is keeping quiet, potentially for his own health, better?",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The user explicitly states, ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself,"" indicating a direct expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness and internal conflict are present (e.g., ""I’m feeling that it’s wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don’t want to keep going myself""). However, these emotions support the explicit suicidal intent rather than standing alone.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. There are no references to specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. The user mentions being suicidal but clarifies they have ""never told anyone"" and describes no history of actions taken toward suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""I'm suicidal myself"") and strongly implied (""I don’t want to keep going myself""). The emotional context (hopelessness, guilt) reinforces suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods, preparations, or imminent intent are described. The focus is on internal thoughts and moral conflict, not actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The suicidal feelings are described as ongoing and current (""I’m suicidal myself""), but there is no reference to past actions or attempts. The user emphasizes secrecy (""never told anyone""), suggesting thoughts have not progressed to behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses clear suicidal intent without plans, methods, or actions. This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t want to keep going"") without concrete steps. While distress and hopelessness are evident, the absence of plans/preparations rules out ""Behavior"" or ""Attempt."" ""Indicator"" is insufficient due to the explicit suicidal desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""kill myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The post expresses blame, victimization (""treated me different""), and externalization of responsibility (""Everything is their fault""), but no overt hopelessness or despair beyond the suicidal reference.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions taken are mentioned. The statement is conditional (""If I become worse..."") and lacks imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to potential future actions (""If I become worse...""), not past events or attempts. No description of prior suicidal behavior.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"").  
   - Direct expression of wanting to die under certain conditions is present.  
   - **Verdict**: Strongly implies suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

   - **Explicit suicide mentions**: The post contains direct phrases like ""killing myself"" and ""I could do it right now,"" indicating a clear desire to die. Emotional context includes despair (""neverending cycle,"" ""I'm done""), fear of death, and hopelessness.
   - **Plan or method identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. The reference to parents removing ""means"" is passive and does not describe active planning or actions by the user. The phrase ""I could do it right now"" suggests immediacy but is counterbalanced by explicit barriers (fear of death), lacking concrete steps.
   - **Temporal context**: The post focuses on current/future intentions (""I could do it right now,"" ""hope that I don’t wake up""), with no references to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Phrases like ""killing myself"" and ""I could do it right now"" are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No. While imminent intent (""right now"") is implied, no specific method, plan, or preparatory action is described. Fear is stated as the primary barrier, emphasizing internal conflict rather than actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Current/future focus. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""killing myself"") and severe distress but lacks any specific plan, method, or action taken. The presence of barriers (fear) and absence of concrete steps align with **Ideation**, which covers strong suicidal intent without progression to planning or behavior.

The only thing keeping me here is I don't know what happens after I die. I don't know if there's a heaven (I doubt) or is it just complete blackness.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct statements: ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself."" These are unambiguous expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""nothing to live for""), worthlessness (""no one would miss me""), isolation (failing friendships, hating family), and fear of the unknown after death.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions taken are mentioned. Fear of death is noted as a deterrent, but no concrete steps toward suicide are described.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on **current** desires (""I want to die"") and internal conflict (fear of death vs. desire to die). No references to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""want to die"" confirm explicit suicidal intent. Emotional context (despair, isolation) reinforces this.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are indicated. Fear of death is a passive barrier, not an active plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Purely current/future-focused ideation (""I want to die""). No past attempts or behaviors described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal desire** (""I want to kill myself"") but lacks any specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to actions taken. This aligns strictly with **Ideation** (suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).  
   - *Why not other categories?*  
     - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal statements.

Can't stand this anymore.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""I'm better off dead"" is a strong implication of wanting to die (not vague distress). This is not metaphorical (e.g., ""life isn’t worth living"") but directly expresses a desire for death.  
     - *Explicit/Implied Suicide Mention*: **Yes** (strongly implied desire to not be alive).  
     - *Emotional Context*: High hopelessness (""My being in itself is a prison""), despair (""Nothing feels right""), and isolation (""Only 1 person left that cares"") support suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or actions taken. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current suffering (""past few months,"" ""Can't stand this anymore"") but **no reference to past attempts or actions**.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core phrase ""I'm better off dead"" meets the threshold for **Ideation** (explicitly implied desire to die).  
   - Absence of plans, methods, preparations, or past actions rules out **Behavior** and **Attempt**.  
   - Emotional distress alone (e.g., ""broken human being"") would fit **Indicator**, but the explicit wish for death elevates it to **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""killing myself"" and references setting a date for suicide (""I set a date""), indicating strong suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness is implied in past context (""extraordinarily painful,"" ""desperate situation""), but the current tone focuses on recovery.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Specific preparations are described: ""letters were written"" and ""a set plan"" with imminent timing (""days away from going through with"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to past events (e.g., ""I came extraordinarily close,"" ""was days away""). No current/future intent is expressed; instead, the user emphasizes a decision to live.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes **concrete suicidal preparations** (written letters, set plan) with imminent timing. This aligns with the ""Behavior"" category, which includes actions taken toward suicide (e.g., planning, preparing tools) without describing an initiated attempt.
   - It does not fit ""Attempt"" because no actual self-harm action (e.g., initiating the plan) is described—only preparation. ""Ideation"" is insufficient due to the specificity of plans. ""Indicator"" is ruled out by explicit suicidal intent and preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent through phrases like ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" and regret over not acting on suicidal thoughts (""I’m angry at myself for not doing it years ago""). The context conveys a persistent desire to end life.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (regret over enduring life) and anger are present, but these reinforce the suicidal implications rather than standing alone.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. References to past thoughts (""the first time I thought about it"") lack concrete plans or behaviors.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on **past and ongoing ideation** (e.g., ""since 2012,"" ""whenever I think back""). No description of recent/preparatory actions or past attempts.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal ideation** (wishes to not be alive, regret over inaction) but lacks any specific plans, methods, or descriptions of actions taken. This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as suicidal thoughts without concrete steps.  
   - *Why not other categories?*  
     - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal desire (beyond vague distress).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct statements like ""I'm depressed and suicidal,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""wanting to die."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I'm depressed,"" ""It sucks so much"") and despair are present but secondary to explicit suicidal language.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The author describes **preparatory actions**: writing a suicide note with specific instructions for belongings. They also mention logistical planning (""cancel administrative stuff"") to avoid burdening family.
   - **Temporal Context**: The note-writing is a completed action (past), while suicidal urges and administrative concerns are ongoing (present). No description of a past *attempt* (e.g., initiating but aborting an action).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. Direct phrases like ""suicidal"" and ""killing myself"" leave no ambiguity about intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   Yes. **Preparations** are clear: writing a suicide note (a concrete step) and planning administrative tasks to facilitate suicide. Though no *method* (e.g., pills) is specified, preparations alone qualify for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   References to **completed preparations** (note-writing) and **current intent** (""get ready to die"") are present. No mention of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit suicidal ideation (""wanting to die"") rules out 'indicator'.  
   - Preparations (writing a note, planning logistics) exceed passive thoughts, ruling out 'ideation'.  
   - No description of a past or ongoing *attempt* (e.g., ""I tried but stopped""), ruling out 'attempt'.  
   - The combination of **explicit intent + concrete preparations (note)** aligns with 'behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""I've never been more suicidal in my life"" explicitly references suicidal intent. This is a direct expression of current suicidal feelings (Yes).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The post describes distress (e.g., shame over trespassing, family conflict), but these are secondary to the explicit suicidal statement.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned (No).
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No description of past suicide attempts or actions taken toward suicide (No).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""suicidal""), and the phrase expresses a current desire to die (Yes). This rules out ""indicator.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, plans, preparations, or imminent timing are present. The focus is solely on the intensity of suicidal feelings, not actionable steps (No). This rules out ""behavior"" and ""attempt.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The suicidal statement (""I've never been more suicidal"") reflects current/future intent, not past actions. No history of attempts is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post centers on **explicit suicidal ideation** (""I've never been more suicidal"") without plans, methods, or actions. This aligns with the ""ideation"" category (strong desire to die without concrete steps). Emotional context (e.g., guilt over trespassing) supports distress but doesn't elevate the classification.

They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post explicitly references the friend's ""multiple suicide attempts per month"" and ""every week,"" including attempts since the author started communicating with them. Suicide is directly mentioned in the context of past actions.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The author expresses fear, helplessness, and distress about their friend’s situation but focuses on the friend’s experiences, not their own suicidal intent.
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: No specific methods or imminent plans for the **author** are described. All suicidal actions (attempts) are attributed to the friend and framed as past events.
   - **Temporal Context**: References to suicide are exclusively about **past attempts** (e.g., ""multiple suicide attempts per month,"" ""attempts since we started talking""). No current/future intent or planning is indicated for the author.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - The author does **not** express personal suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions. All explicit mentions (e.g., ""suicide attempts"") describe the **friend's** behavior.  
   - *Answer: No (for the author)*.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent are stated for the **author**.  
   - *Answer: No*.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References to suicide are strictly about **past events** (the friend’s attempts). The author’s distress is reactive, not self-directed.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator/Ideation Ruled Out**: The author shows distress but lacks explicit/implied personal suicidal desire (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
   - **Behavior Ruled Out**: No personal plans, methods, or imminent actions.  
   - **Attempt Applicability**: The post **describes past suicide attempts** (the friend’s), but the classification must focus **solely on the author**. The author discloses no personal history of attempts.  
   - **Final Verdict**: The author’s content shows severe distress but **no personal suicidal intent, plans, or past actions**. Mentions of suicide are solely about another person. Thus, it fits **Indicator** (general distress without suicidal intent).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""end it all"" and the rhetorical question ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don’t want to be here?"" strongly imply suicidal intent. The statement ""I won’t ever be happy in this world"" and ""don’t want to be here"" express a desire to cease existing.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I won’t ever be happy""), despair (""Everything is a chore""), and exhaustion (""I’m so tired"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: A method (gun) is mentioned hypothetically (""a gun would solve everything""), but the author explicitly states they *cannot* access it (""I can’t get hold of a gun""). No preparations, actions, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are described.  
   - **Temporal Context**: All statements reflect *current* ideation (e.g., ""my thoughts always come back to this""). No references to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""end it all,"" ""don’t want to be here"") but lacks:  
     - Concrete plans/preparations (method is hypothetical/blocked).  
     - Imminent intent (e.g., no timeframe like ""tonight"").  
     - Past or ongoing actions (no attempt described).  
   - This aligns with **Ideation**: Strong suicidal intent is present, but no specific plan, preparation, or behavior is indicated. The hypothetical method mention does not escalate to ""behavior"" since it is framed as inaccessible and not actionable.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not. I believe in God but sometimes he feels so far away. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to post. I have no one to talk to.,1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post includes phrases like ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die,"" which are **strongly implied expressions of suicidal desire**. However, there is no explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""killing myself.""  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The author expresses hopelessness (""I feel like a failure""), despair (""It feels like an effort just to get up""), and shame (""I am a failure in some ways"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: **No specific methods** (e.g., pills, hanging) or **preparations** (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: All suicidal expressions refer to **current feelings** (e.g., ""when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die""). **No past attempts** are described.  
   - **Mitigating Factors**: The author acknowledges reasons to live (love for dogs, future graduation plans) and states medication helps.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator?** No. Vague distress (e.g., ""life isn’t worth living"") alone would fit here, but the explicit desire to die (""I wish I could die"") elevates it beyond general distress.  
   - **Ideation?** Yes. The post shows **strongly implied suicidal thoughts** (""I wish I could die"") without methods, preparations, or imminent intent. Emotional distress supports this, but the absence of plans/actions keeps it in this category.  
   - **Behavior?** No. There is no mention of plans, methods, timing (e.g., ""tonight""), or actions taken.  
   - **Attempt?** No. No description of past suicidal actions.

316,"Nsfw. So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing. Terrible feeling and I just wanted to get it out of my head, sorry you had to read this, nasty",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""wanting to kill myself"" is an explicit declaration of suicidal intent. The post also includes intense emotional distress (self-disgust, shame, hopelessness) linked directly to this desire.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned. No preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are described.
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal thought (""wanting to kill myself"") is expressed as a current/recurring ideation. There is no mention of past attempts or actions taken toward suicide.
   - **Other Elements**: The act of masturbating to the thought of suicide reflects a disturbing coping mechanism but does not constitute a concrete suicidal action or plan.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit statement (""kill myself"") confirms suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**: Strong desire to die is directly stated.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No methods, preparations, or imminent timing are indicated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Current ideation**: Focuses on present thoughts (""I just kept thinking about""). No past attempts referenced.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post meets the criteria for **Ideation**: Explicit suicidal thoughts (""wanting to kill myself"") are present, but there is no description of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. The emotional context (self-hatred, hopelessness) reinforces suicidal intent but lacks actionable steps.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or strong implied expressions of suicidal intent (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""I want to die""). Phrases like ""I wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" convey hopelessness but lack explicit/implied desire to die.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No mention of suicide methods, preparations, or imminent intent. References to past self-harm (""cutting"") are discussed as coping mechanisms, not suicidal actions.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on past self-harm incidents and emotional distress (e.g., ""a few months ago,"" ""past"" self-harm). The phrase ""some day's I wonder"" reflects ongoing hopelessness but not current intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong themes of invalidation, shame, loneliness, and despair due to others dismissing self-harm.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes **past self-harm** (non-suicidal injury) and emotional pain from others' disbelief, but **no suicidal intent** is explicit or strongly implied.  
   - General statements like ""I wonder if it's even worth it"" align with vague hopelessness under **Indicator**, as they lack actionable suicidal desire.  
   - References to self-harm scars and others encouraging the girlfriend to ""kill herself"" do not shift focus to the author’s suicidal intent.  
   - Rules applied: Absence of suicidal ideation/plans/attempts by the author confirms **Indicator**.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts,"" indicating a direct expression of wanting to die.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. The user mentions *considering* hospitalization to avoid acting on thoughts but describes no specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on *current* ideation (""I’d rather go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts"") and future concerns (waiting until February 1st). No references to past attempts or actions.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Describes severe depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and barriers to coping (e.g., lost routines, lack of support).  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded because suicidal intent is explicit (""suicidal ideation,"" ""act on my suicidal thoughts"").  
   - **Behavior**: Excluded. No plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent are described. The hospitalization consideration is a *preventive* measure, not an action toward suicide.  
   - **Attempt**: Excluded. No description of past/current self-harm actions or interrupted attempts.  
   - **Ideation**: Fits best. The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to avoid acting on them, but lacks plans, methods, or preparatory behaviors.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead"" are explicit expressions of a desire to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""fuck that,"" ""kills me inside""), despair (rejection of forced treatment), anger (""fuck them,"" ""they will pay""), and perceived betrayal by family.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Daily heroin use is described as an active behavior. While not explicitly labeled as a suicide method, the context links it directly to the stated outcome (""I hope I die soon... Soon I will be finally dead""), implying heroin is a means to achieve death.  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. Mentions past antipsychotic use but no suicide attempts.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Future intent (""soon I will be finally dead"") with ongoing high-risk behavior (daily heroin use).  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present (""die soon,"" ""finally dead""), moving beyond **Indicator**.  
   - Daily heroin use constitutes a **preparation/action** tied to suicidal intent, as it is a lethal behavior actively pursued to achieve death. This aligns with **Behavior** (defined as suicidal thoughts plus actions/preparations).  
   - No past attempts are described, ruling out **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post does not use direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it strongly implies intent to die by asking about the most effective method to fatally injure the brain stem with a gun. Phrases like ""I don’t care about... so much to live for"" and ""I genuinely do not care"" express a clear desire to disregard reasons to stay alive, reinforcing suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The tone reflects hopelessness, resignation, and a fixation on death (e.g., dismissing family or future regrets).
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: A specific method (gunshot targeting the brain stem) is explicitly detailed, and the question (""What position..."") indicates active planning or preparation.
   - **Temporal Context**: No reference to past attempts. The focus is on current/future intent (seeking method details).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is **strongly implied** (Yes). The method inquiry and dismissal of life-affirming reasons confirm a desire to die.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method mentioned? **Yes** (gun targeting brain stem).  
   - Signs of preparation? **Yes** (seeking optimal positioning implies actionable planning).  
   - Imminent intent? Not explicitly stated, but the method specificity overrides this.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - No past attempts described. Focus is on current/future actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (vague distress) due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - It surpasses *Ideation* (thoughts without plans) because it details a method and seeks optimization, indicating preparation.  
   - *Attempt* is inapplicable (no past action described).  
   - **Behavior** fits: Explicit suicidal intent + specific method + implied preparation (seeking technical guidance).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states: ""thought about killing myself"" and ""it won't leave my head."" These are direct expressions of suicidal ideation.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""everything just keeps getting worse"") and distress (parental invalidation of self-harm).  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method, preparation, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned.  
   - **Past Attempts/Behavior**: Self-harm scars are referenced, but self-harm ≠ suicide attempt. No description of a past suicide attempt or preparatory action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Explicit/Implied Desire to Die**: Yes (""killing myself"").  
   - **Severe Distress with Implied Intent**: Ideation is explicit, not vague.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, tools, locations, or preparatory actions for suicide are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Ideation is ongoing (""hasn't been a single day"") but not time-bound (e.g., ""tonight""). Self-harm is past behavior, but not framed as a suicide attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is **persistent, explicit suicidal thoughts** (""thought about killing myself daily"").  
   - Lacks plans, methods, or actions (e.g., acquiring means, setting a date).  
   - Self-harm scars indicate self-injury but do not meet the threshold for ""attempt"" (no suicide-linked action described).  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die without concrete plans/preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit suicide mention: ""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself"" directly states suicidal intent.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't know what the fuck to do anymore""), despair (""I'm sick of life"").  
   - Plan/method: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, but the phrase ""Let's just do it"" implies imminent intent to act.  
   - Temporal context: Refers to current/future intentions (""Let's just do it""), not past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. ""Killing myself"" is an explicit declaration.  
   - **Yes**. ""My only way out"" and ""Let's just do it"" strongly imply desire to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method, but imminent intent (""Let's just do it"") suggests urgency.  
   - **Rule application**: Strong intent with imminent timing (even without method) leans toward **'behavior'**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Current/future focus (""do it"" now), no mention of past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond *indicator*.  
   - Lack of specific method/preparation rules out *attempt*.  
   - Imminent intent (""Let's just do it"") elevates it from *ideation* to **behavior** (per guidelines: ""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I'm going to attempt again,"" ""I want to die,"" ""my mind wants to die,"" and references to past overdoses as suicide attempts explicitly indicate suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I give up""), self-hatred (""I hate every little thing about myself""), and despair (""I don't want to get better"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: 
     - A timeline is specified (""Just a few more hours"") for a future attempt, indicating imminent intent.
     - Past methods are mentioned (""overdose three times""), but the imminent plan lacks a specific new method. The temporal urgency (""tonight"" implied by ""few more hours"") qualifies as preparation.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: Yes. Clear descriptions of past actions: ""I've tried to overdose three times"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""attempt again,"" ""I want to die"") and strongly implied (""my mind has won""). **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Imminent intent is declared (""few more hours""), acting as a preparation indicator. Past methods (overdosing) reinforce behavioral context. **Yes**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - References past attempts (""overdose three times,"" ""first attempt"") but focuses on imminent future action (""going to attempt again"" in hours). **Current/future intent dominates**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Ideation**: Insufficient; imminent plan (""few more hours"") moves beyond thoughts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes severe emotional distress, multiple traumatic life events (e.g., family estrangement, loss, guilt, addiction), and culminates in the explicit statement: **""I just want this pain to end.""**  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used.  
     - However, **""I just want this pain to end""** strongly implies a desire to escape suffering through death (e.g., equating ""ending pain"" with not being alive). This is reinforced by overwhelming hopelessness. → **Yes** (strongly implied).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No mention of methods (e.g., pills), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions taken.  
     - No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). → **No**.  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Focuses on current suffering and past trauma. No reference to past suicide attempts or self-harm actions. → **No attempt described**.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core phrase **""I just want this pain to end""** signals a strong, passive desire to cease existence, aligning with **suicidal ideation** (defined as explicit/implied desire to die without plans/actions).  
   - While the post shows extreme distress (e.g., guilt, hopelessness), it lacks:  
     - Concrete plans or methods (ruling out *Behavior*).  
     - References to past self-harm actions (ruling out *Attempt*).  
     - Vague references to death without suicidal intent would fit *Indicator*, but the implied longing for pain to end through death elevates it to **Ideation**.

   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct statements: ""I'm suicidal"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go,"" which strongly imply a desire to die or end life.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness and despair are evident (e.g., ""don't think I'll make it past this summer,"" reaction to dismissal).
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) are mentioned. The phrase ""this summer"" implies future timing but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete details.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on current/future intentions (""don't think I'll make it past this summer"") with no reference to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

327,"It's over for me. I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry. I'm so sorry. There is no putting me back together. Im broken. I'm damaged. I'm all fucked up. I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""I should have killed myself a long time ago,"" ""I tried,"" and ""I promise I won’t fail this time."" Strong intent is explicit.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""I’m drowning in depression""), self-hatred (""I am trash""), shame, and isolation are present.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific method mentioned (""hanging is painless""). Preparations include buying materials (""gonna buy the right stuff"") and setting a timeline (""gonna be gone after this weekend"").
   - **Temporal Context**: References past attempts (""I tried. I tried. But it didn’t work"") and outlines imminent future intent (""after this weekend"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. Direct statements like ""killed myself"" and ""I won’t fail this time"" confirm suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   Yes. Method (hanging) and active preparations (buying materials, saying goodbyes) are specified. Imminent timing (""after this weekend"") is explicit.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   Combines past attempts (""I tried"") with current/future plans involving concrete actions (procuring means, setting a deadline).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal intent and plans.  
   - **Ideation**: Excluded. While suicidal thoughts are present, concrete plans/preparations push beyond ideation.  
   - **Behavior**: Fits. The post details specific plans (method: hanging), preparations (buying materials), and imminent intent (timeline: ""after this weekend"").  
   - **Attempt**: Excluded. Past attempts are referenced, but the primary focus is on imminent future actions, not a completed past act.

No promises &gt;:) anyway, I hope you all have a great day and thank you for reading to whatever this is",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""killing myself,"" ""Adios I can’t,"" and ""this life for me isn’t it"" explicitly or strongly imply suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""this life for me isn’t it""), guilt/apology (""I’m sorry to the people""), and loneliness (""I don’t know what’s wrong with me"") are present.
   - **Plan or Method**: A specific timeline is mentioned (""at 30 or 25,"" ""innnn 8 yrs or so""), indicating preparation and intent. No concrete method (e.g., pills, jumping) is specified, but the fixed future date (""if I still feel the same by that age"") shows planning.
   - **Past Attempts**: None referenced.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""killing myself"") and strongly implied (""Adios""). Emotional context confirms intent beyond vague distress.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A plan exists (age-based timeline: 25–30 years old), with preparations implied (time to ""rethink"" or ""seek help,"" but commitment to act if unresolved). Imminent intent is absent (delayed 8+ years), but the specificity of timing signals behavioral planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Entirely future-oriented (""planning,"" ""in 8 yrs""). No past actions or attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Ideation**: Suicidal thoughts are present, but the fixed timeline (""at 30 or 25"") and conditional plan (""if I still feel the same"") exceed passive ideation.  
   - **Behavior**: The post includes suicidal intent **plus** a specific future plan (age-triggered action) and preparatory framing (countdown to decision). This aligns with ""preparations or actions taken"" (setting a deadline).  
   - **Attempt**: No past or current actions described.

Now I know why the suicide rate for men is four times as high as for women, and I have so much respect for cismen who have to deal with being eyed with suspicion.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post references suicide rates (""suicide rate for men"") but does not express personal suicidal intent. Phrases like ""teetering on the edge"" imply distress but lack explicit or strong implication of a desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or equivalent).  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The writer discusses societal struggles (being ""perceived as male and a threat"") and expresses empathy for cismen. While frustration is evident, there are no explicit expressions of personal hopelessness or despair tied to suicidal urges.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods, preparations, timing, or actions (e.g., tools, notes, locations).  
   - **Temporal Context**: Uses ""lately"" to describe ongoing distress but no references to past attempts, current plans, or imminent intent.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post focuses on societal issues and generalized distress without expressing a desire to die, describing plans, or referencing personal suicidal actions. The mention of suicide rates is statistical, not self-referential.  
   - **Indicator** fits best: Distress and vague references to societal struggles exist, but there is no explicit/implied suicidal intent, plans, or behaviors.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes explicit references to suicide (""suicide is a coward way"") and strong implications of intent (""Don’t be surprised if I’m gone within 24 hours""). The phrase ""gone within 24 hours"" is a direct expression of wanting to die imminently.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair, hopelessness, and resignation (e.g., ""Peace out all... struggling :("").
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or concrete preparation (e.g., writing a note) is mentioned. However, the phrase ""within 24 hours"" indicates **imminent intent**.
   - **Past Attempts**: None referenced.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide"") and strongly implied (""I’m gone within 24 hours"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present.  
   - Emotional context (despair + imminent intent) confirms suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method or preparation described.  
   - **Imminent intent** is clear (""within 24 hours""). This shifts the classification toward 'behavior' per guidelines: *""strong intent with imminent timing (e.g., 'tonight') even without a method leans toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.'""*

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **future intent** (""within 24 hours""), not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire with imminent timing (""within 24 hours""), satisfying the 'behavior' definition: *""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method.""*  
   - This exceeds 'ideation' (thoughts without timing/plan) and lacks the concrete action required for 'attempt' (past action). 'Indicator' is ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent.

331,"Abused as a child. I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I don't have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or strong implications of ending life (e.g., ""I want to die""). Phrases like ""it's killing me"" are metaphorical expressions of distress.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness, shame, and despair (""I hate myself,"" ""it's killing me""), but no explicit desire to die.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods, preparations, or imminent intent. Focus is on seeking legal protection (restraining order) and escaping abuse.  
   - **Temporal Context**: References past abuse and ongoing struggles, but no description of past suicide attempts or future plans to self-harm.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses severe distress and helplessness due to abuse, but lacks **explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent**.  
   - Key phrases (""it's killing me,"" ""I hate myself"") reflect emotional anguish, not active suicidal thoughts or actions.  
   - The plea for a restraining order and desire to move out signal a focus on survival, not self-harm.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Distress without suicidal ideation/behavior.

What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct expressions: ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time."" These are explicit declarations of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""What the hell makes them think this won’t end badly"") and despair are present but secondary to explicit suicidal statements.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned. However, the phrase ""I should do it now"" implies **imminent intent** (temporal urgency).
   - **Actions/Preparations**: Current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") is described, but this is framed as a precursor to suicide rather than a suicidal action itself. No explicit suicide preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are noted.
   - **Temporal Context**: All suicidal references are future-oriented (""it’s a matter of time,"" ""I should do it now""). Past self-harm is mentioned, but no past suicide attempts are described.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** (general distress) due to explicit suicidal intent.
   - It surpasses **Ideation** (thoughts without plans/actions) because of:
     - Imminent intent (""do it now"").
     - Current self-harm behavior contextualized as escalating toward suicide.
   - **Behavior** applies: Suicidal ideation is paired with imminent intent and self-harm as a correlated risk behavior. No concrete suicide attempt is described (ruling out **Attempt**).  
   - **Rules Compliance**: Focus is solely on the author’s actions/intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct expressions like ""someone blow my head off,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" and ""please kill me,"" which explicitly convey a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""im fucking done""), self-loathing (""i fucking deserve death""), and fear of harming others (""before i hurt someone"") are present, reinforcing suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: A method (""blow my head off"") is mentioned, but there is no indication of preparation (e.g., acquiring tools) or imminent action (e.g., ""tonight""). The plea for others to act (""someone blow my head off"") suggests passive ideation rather than personal behavioral steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: No references to past attempts. Focus is on current/future intent (""please kill me"").

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""deserve death,"" ""kill me"") and a method (""blow my head off""), but lacks evidence of preparation, actions taken, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). This aligns with **Ideation**, which covers strong suicidal thoughts with methods referenced but no concrete steps. The plea for others to act does not constitute personal behavioral escalation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now"" strongly imply suicidal intent. The language expresses a direct desire to die to escape problems.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness and anxiety about future instability (e.g., unemployment, homelessness) are present but secondary to explicit suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., tools, location) is mentioned. Preparations or actions taken (e.g., acquiring means) are absent. The phrase ""right now"" suggests immediacy but lacks concrete steps, leaning toward ideation over behavior.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intentions (""if I ended my life right now""). No references to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is strongly implied (""cut my life short,"" ""ended my life""). Severe distress reinforces intent, moving beyond vague hopelessness.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent actions described. Timing (""right now"") is not paired with a plan, so it does not meet the threshold for ""behavior.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current/future ideation. No past attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""end my life"") without a specific plan, method, or action. This aligns with **Ideation** (explicit thoughts about suicide without concrete steps). It does not qualify as ""behavior"" (requires plan/preparation) or ""attempt"" (requires past action). General distress alone is insufficient for ""indicator"" due to clear suicidal intent.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit mentions: ""I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and ""I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers... hoped I wouldn’t wake up"" directly reference suicidal actions.  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I’m a failure""), shame, isolation, and substance abuse.  
   - Plan/method: Specific method (overdose on pills) and preparation (""took"" pills).  
   - Past attempts: Clear description of two recent suicide attempts (within 4 days), including the most recent pill overdose.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""End it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and ""hoped I wouldn’t wake up"" are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (muscle relaxers and painkillers) and action taken (""took"" pills).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to **past events**: Two attempts in the last 4 days, including yesterday’s overdose.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes **concrete past actions** with suicidal intent (taking pills to die). This fits the *Attempt* category, defined as describing a past suicide attempt (even if incomplete). Current ideation (""I want to die"") is noted, but the clear account of a recent attempt overrides other classifications.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""kill myself""). Phrases like ""life is nothing more than a total curse"" express hopelessness but lack explicit or strong suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair, hopelessness (""I have nothing""), victimization (""bullied, harassed""), and isolation. However, these are framed as external circumstances (societal, cultural, economic), not inward expressions of self-harm.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or actions taken toward suicide.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on past/present suffering (e.g., ""treated like shit my whole life"") with no references to future suicidal plans, attempts, or imminent intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS?**  
   - **No**. Distress is present, but no language implies a desire to end life.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post explicitly states ""I'm feeling suicidal"" and ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more."" It strongly implies suicidal intent with phrases like ""the only escape to this situation is suicide."" (Yes to both explicit mentions and expressions of wanting to die).
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The author describes panic attacks, inability to sleep, feeling like a ""burden,"" and hopelessness about impending consequences (parents discovering their actions, potential suspension).
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned. The phrase ""I am going to get to know what is the decision of the management today"" implies anticipation but lacks imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: All references to suicidal thoughts are current/future-oriented. No mention of past attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""feeling suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts"") and strongly implied (""the only escape is suicide""). Emotional context (despair, hopelessness) reinforces intent, leaning toward 'ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are described. The absence of concrete actions or plans rules out 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future distress (upcoming management decision). No references to past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post clearly expresses active suicidal thoughts and a desire to escape via suicide, meeting the **Ideation** definition (explicit intent without plans, methods, or actions). It lacks the specificity for 'behavior' (no plan/preparation) and describes no past actions for 'attempt'. While distress is severe, explicit suicidal intent moves it beyond 'indicator'.

   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct references to suicide (""end it,"" ""suicide ideation,"" ""attempted,"" ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"") and explicit expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""my death would make many happy,"" ""this is all I have left"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I am left wanting to jump""), despair (""My heart is too tired""), and perceived burdensomeness (""nobody would care"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The author specifies a method (""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"") and details preparation (""I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks""). They also describe repeated rehearsals of the act (going to the tracks but ""jump away"").
   - **Past Attempts/Preparations**: Yes. References past attempts (""the times I have tried,"" ""jump away at the last minute"") and a specific past attempt where a friend called 911.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. Clear expressions of suicidal intent (e.g., ""I know the way I will end it,"" ""I want to jump in front of an Amtrak"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   Yes. Specific method (train), imminent intent (""I see it approaching""), and preparation (knowing the schedule, proximity to tracks). Rehearsed actions (""I panic and jump away"") indicate ongoing behavioral engagement.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   Mix of past and present. Past attempts are acknowledged (""times I have tried""), but the primary focus is on current intent, preparations, and imminent actions (""How do I stay on the tracks?"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - It surpasses **Ideation** by detailing a specific method (train), preparations (track knowledge), and repeated near-actions.  
   - While past attempts are noted, the dominant theme is **current plans and actions** (method, schedule, rehearsals). This aligns with **Behavior**, defined as suicidal intent plus specific plans/preparations.  
   - **Attempt** does not fit best, as the described actions (jumping away) are aborted; the core focus is on planning and imminent risk.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or strong implications of suicidal intent (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""suicide,"" or ""end my life""). The post expresses feelings of being a burden, isolation, and hopelessness but does not explicitly or implicitly state a desire to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong distress, worthlessness (""I'm a burden""), and functional impairment (isolation, unemployment, inactivity).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No mention of methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., no tools, locations, or timing like ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Describes ongoing circumstances (e.g., chronic isolation) without references to past attempts or future suicidal actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post aligns with **Indicator** because:  
     - It shows severe distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent (e.g., no expressions of wanting to die).  
     - Vague struggles like ""I’m a burden"" or ""lay in bed all day"" suggest risk factors but do not meet the threshold for ideation, behavior, or attempt.  
     - Under the rules, general despair without suicidal intent remains in ""indicator.""

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

     - Direct statements: ""I can kill myself on graduation night"" and ""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life tbh.""  
     - Strong expressions of intent: ""be done with life"" + method specificity.  
     - **Verdict**: **Yes** (explicit and implied).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - Specific method: ""stick some knives through my stomach.""

     - **Verdict**: **Yes** (method + imminent timing).  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Focuses on **future intent** (""graduation night"") with no mention of past actions/attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**:  
     - Explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"") + specific method (knives) + timeframe (""graduation night"") meets the **Behavior** threshold.  
     - Rules: A plan/method + imminent timing elevates beyond Ideation, even without immediate action.  
   - **Attempt Ruled Out**: No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  
   - **Indicator Ruled Out**: Explicit suicidal intent overrides general distress.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""commit when i get home"" and ""drafted my suicide notes"" explicitly reference suicide.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""It doesn’t seem to exist, not for me anyway"") and exhaustion (""I can’t anymore"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific methods (""tall bridges,"" ""a few methods to try"") and preparations (""researching tall bridges,"" ""drafted my suicide notes"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Future intent (""commit when i get home""), not past events.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. ""Commit"" (short for ""commit suicide"") and ""suicide notes"" are explicit. Strong desire to die is clear.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   Yes. Methods (bridges/unspecified alternatives) and concrete preparations (research, drafting notes) are present. Imminent timing is implied (""when I get home"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains multiple explicit references to suicide (""kill myself,"" ""end it all,"" ""commit lifen't"" [a clear euphemism for suicide]). It also includes strong expressions of desire to die (e.g., ""I’m finally free to end it all,"" ""I need to have the option to end it all"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The post expresses hopelessness (""I don’t have anyone worth staying alive for"") and relief (""a weight off my chest""), but these reinforce suicidal intent rather than standalone distress.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The user describes concrete preparations: ""looking into my options to end it all,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" and imminent intent (""once I’m ready to end it""). Though no specific method (e.g., pills) is named, the active planning and organizational steps qualify as preparatory behavior.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. The post focuses on current/future actions, with no mention of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""end it all,"" ""commit lifen't"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""I need to have the option to end it all"").  
   - **Conclusion**: Strong evidence of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods are not named, but the user describes active preparation (""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row"") and imminent intent (""once I’m ready to end it"").  
   - **Conclusion**: Preparatory actions and imminent intent align with 'behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The post discusses current/future intentions (""finally moving forward,"" ""I’ll make my decision""). No past attempts are referenced.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - It surpasses *Ideation* because it includes preparatory actions (researching options, organizing plans) and imminent intent.  
   - *Attempt* is not applicable, as no past actions are described.  
   - **Best fit**: **Behavior** (defined as suicidal thoughts plus preparations/actions, even without a named method).

Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful and even more so to the ones that's suffered so much. For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key Elements**: The post describes past feelings of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and insomnia during lockdown. It mentions passive thoughts like ""what if I wasn't in this world"" and ""gain peace,"" explicitly framing them as a realization of being ""on the verge of becoming suicidal."" The author clarifies they ""never really thought I would act it out."" No methods, plans, preparations, or actions are mentioned. The tone shifts to hope and a book recommendation for others struggling.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - **Yes**, suicide is explicitly referenced (""on the verge of becoming suicidal""), but the context is retrospective and lacks *current* desire or intent. The emotional weight centers on past distress, not active wishes to die.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No**. No methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") are described. The author explicitly rejects acting on thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - **Past events only**. All suicidal ideation is framed as a historical experience (""was very depressed,"" ""thoughts came,"" ""scared me""). The present perspective focuses on recovery and encouragement.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows severe distress (depression, hopelessness) and *passively* references death/peace, but lacks **explicit or strongly implied current desire to die**. The admission of past near-suicidal ideation is countered by clear disavowal of action (""never thought I would act it out""). This aligns with **Indicator**, which captures vague death-related thoughts without suicidal intent. Emotional distress alone is insufficient for Ideation; explicit/implied intent is required to escalate the category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""end myself"" and ""end it"" are strong, direct expressions of suicidal intent. Emotional distress (e.g., ""really depressed,"" ""crying all night"") reinforces severity.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method (""overdose"") is stated, and imminent timing (""tonight"") is emphasized. The word ""again"" implies prior actions, but the primary focus is current intent.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a future intention (""tonight"") and hints at past attempts (""again""), but the post centers on immediate plans.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post includes **explicit suicidal intent** (""end myself"") and a **specific method** (""overdose""), with **imminent timing** (""tonight""). This aligns with the **Behavior** category, defined by suicidal thoughts combined with a concrete plan or imminent intent. Emotional distress alone would not elevate it beyond this, but the explicit plan does.  
   - *Why not Ideation?* Ideation requires no plan/method—here, both are present.  
   - *Why not Attempt?* ""Try"" implies future action, not a past/completed act.  
   - *Why not Indicator?* Explicit suicidal intent and a plan exceed vague distress.

   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., buying tools, writing a note).  
   - **Temporal Context**: Future-focused (""next month or two""), not imminent (e.g., ""tonight""). No reference to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Strongly implied desire to die/die soon? **Yes** (""My death will release my pain"").

I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain . I'm so scared I've never done anything like this before and I'm so scared of the pain I will cause to my parents and family . Thank you for listening and I hope I can get the peace i need .",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""run out of options / about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it,"" and ""I'm ready to do it.""  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I've hit rock bottom""), shame (""I feel like a complete failure""), and overwhelm are present.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are named (""knife and some pills""), and preparations are described (""lock myself in the bathroom""). Imminent timing is explicit (""about to,"" ""It's currently 6 in the morning"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to immediate future intent (""about to lock myself"") and past struggles, but no prior suicide attempts are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly referenced (""suicide is on my mind"") and strongly implied (""do it"" contextually means suicide). Expressions of intent are direct (""I'm ready to do it"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods (knife, pills) and preparations (locking in the bathroom) are stated. Imminent timing (""about to,"" current 6 AM) indicates immediate intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future actions (""about to lock myself""), not past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Ideation** due to:  
     - Concrete methods (knife/pills).  
     - Preparations (locking in the bathroom).  
     - Imminent intent (""about to"").  
   - **Behavior** fits best (specific plan + preparation + imminent timing). No past attempt is described, ruling out **Attempt**. Severe distress alone wouldn’t qualify as **Indicator**.

What's really worrying is I'm 26 now and each year has got worse yes there's lots of factors but there's levels of depression I didn't think we're possible. As you all well know,2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes explicit phrases like ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"" and ""contemplate method over 100 times a day,"" directly indicating a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""each year has got worse,"" ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible"") and anhedonia (""no interest in modern life"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Methods are contemplated (""contemplate method over 100 times a day""), but no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is named, and there are no mentions of preparation (e.g., acquiring tools), actions taken (e.g., writing a note), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: All references are to current, ongoing experiences (e.g., ""constantly,"" ""each year has got worse""). No past attempts or actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. Suicidal intent is explicit through phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""contemplate method."" The emotional context (severe depression) reinforces this intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. While methods are frequently contemplated, no concrete plan, preparation, or imminent intent is specified. Contemplation alone is insufficient for ""behavior.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Current/future intentions only**. No past attempts or actions are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""suicidal thoughts constantly,"" ""contemplate method""), aligning with **Ideation**.  
   - It lacks specific plans, preparations, actions, or imminent intent required for ""behavior.""  
   - No past or current suicide attempt is described, ruling out ""attempt.""  
   - While severe hopelessness is present, explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond ""indicator.""

353,"Please help, I'm at my rope's end. Basically,. I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me). I was loyal and did that. &amp;#x200B;. And suffered through all of this hell because of that decision",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""I jsut want to die"" is a direct expression of a desire to end life, meeting the threshold for explicit suicidal ideation. No strong implications beyond this are present.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The post describes severe distress (e.g., feeling trapped, helpless, betrayed, and traumatized) but these alone do not constitute suicidal intent without explicit statements.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. Phrases like ""lock myself in a house"" refer to avoidance, not suicide planning.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The statement ""I jsut want to die"" reflects current intent. No references to past attempts or actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."") are present.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit statement ""I jsut want to die"" confirms **active suicidal ideation** (passive: ""wish I weren’t here""; active: ""want to die"").  
   - Absence of plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past actions (e.g., ""I tried..."") rules out **Attempt**.  
   - While distress is severe, explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond **Indicator**.

I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" strongly implies suicidal intent (wanting to die via a fatal action). The context of despair (""I don’t know what to do"") reinforces this.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""I feel like a fuck up""), shame (""my mom thinks I’m stupid""), and isolation are present.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: A specific method is described (""driving 100 mph into a tree"") with immediacy (""sitting in my car right now"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Current intent (""right now"") with no mention of past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Strongly implied desire to die (tree crash as a suicide method).  
   - **Yes**: Direct expression of suicidal ideation (""thinking of driving... into a tree"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (car crash into a tree) and imminent timing (""right now"").  
   - **Preparation/Actions**: No evidence of physical preparation (e.g., ""I started the car""), but the immediacy and location (""sitting in my car"") suggest proximity to action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to **current/future intentions** (""thinking of... right now""), not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (vague distress) due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - It surpasses *Ideation* (thoughts without plans) by detailing a method (""driving into a tree"") and imminent timing (""right now"").  
   - It does not describe a past *Attempt* (no action taken).  
   - **Behavior** applies: Strong suicidal intent + specific method + imminent timing.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously"" → Explicit mention of past suicide-related actions.  
     - ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well"" → Strong implication of future suicidal intent (joining deceased mother).  
     - ""I’m so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing"" → Explicit reference to impending death (""my passing"").  
     → **Yes** to explicit suicide mentions and expressions of wanting to die.  
   
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) described.  
     - No preparations or actions taken (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note).  
     - Imminent timing tied to mother’s death (""once my mum passes""), but no concrete plan or immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").  
     → **No** to current plan/method/preparation.  

   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Past: Hospitalization for suicide struggle (explicit past attempt).  
     - Future: Intent to die after mother’s passing (""I will be joining her"").  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** (""hospitalised for it previously""), meeting the *Attempt* category definition (concrete past action with suicidal intent).  
   - While future ideation (""I will be joining her"") exists, the *Attempt* category takes precedence when a past attempt is clearly stated, per the rules.  
   - The emotional distress, self-blame, and hopelessness support context but do not override the explicit past attempt.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post contains expressions of severe distress (""I wake up even more tired of living,"" ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it""). However, there are **no explicit references** to suicide (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strong implications of wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). The phrase ""stop it"" is ambiguous and could refer to ending emotional pain rather than life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I feel so weak, so hopeless""), shame (""I feel so stupid""), exhaustion, and recurring nightmares dominate the narrative.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: **No specific methods** (e.g., pills, weapons), **preparations** (e.g., notes), or **imminent timing** (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on ongoing suffering since a breakup 6 months ago and recent struggles (e.g., dreams worsening over months). **No references to past attempts or actions taken**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS?**  
   - **No**. Language implies despair but lacks direct/strong suicidal intent (e.g., ""tired of living"" suggests emotional exhaustion, not active death-seeking).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD?**  
   - **No**. Absence of concrete plans, methods, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT?**  
   - **Current/future suffering only**. No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post depicts **severe distress and hopelessness** but lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent, plans, or behaviors. Phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""stop it"" are vague and contextualized as exhaustion from emotional pain, not active suicidal desire.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: General distress without clear suicidal ideation/action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""constantly contemplate suicide"" directly states suicidal thoughts. The statement ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" strongly implies a desire to not be alive.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I don't know where I want to go,"" ""mediocre existence""), despair (""all I have the desire to do is make money""), and shame (""all my ancestors died for me to... be depressed"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The focus is on persistent thoughts, not actions.
   - **Past Attempts**: No references to prior suicide attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly named (""contemplate suicide""), and the desire to not exist is strongly implied. This rules out ""indicator.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, plans, or preparatory actions are described. The absence of imminent intent (e.g., timing) or concrete steps rules out ""behavior.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The post describes ongoing contemplation (""constantly contemplate"") without reference to past attempts. The phrase ""used to"" contrasts past interests with current despair but doesn't indicate prior suicidal actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""contemplate suicide"") and a wish to not exist, meeting the criteria for **ideation**. There is no evidence of plans, preparations, imminent intent, or past attempts, ruling out ""behavior"" and ""attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post directly mentions ""suicide"" (""When to know if suicide is better"") and uses phrases like ""the release [death] is better,"" implying a desire to die to escape suffering.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""all I have is that,"" ""life is a bust"") and despair linked to lifelong trauma.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Past Attempts or Actions**: No reference to prior suicide attempts, self-interrupted actions, or concrete steps taken.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future contemplation (""When to know if suicide is better""), not past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: ""I wanna go sleep forever"" strongly implies a desire to die (beyond literal sleep). Combined with ""can't take this shit no more"" and ""sick and tired of my shitty life,"" this expresses severe distress and intent to end life.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Specific quantities and types of medication are listed (""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax""). This indicates both a method (overdose) and possession of means.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes current intent (""I wanna go sleep forever""), not past actions. No reference to prior attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""sleep forever"") and identifies a concrete method (medication overdose) with preparations evident (possession of pills).

""Hopefully I won’t wake up tomorrow"" expresses a desire to die (passive suicidal ideation). Emotional distress (""tired of being alone,"" ""depressed"") supports context.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method, timing, or preparation described (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent actions like ""tonight""). Future intent (""Christmas probably won’t be happening... that'll get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"") suggests potential recurrence but lacks immediacy or concrete steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: The phrase ""attempt properly again"" explicitly references a **past suicide attempt** (""again"" confirms recurrence). The wish not to wake up and future ideation are secondary to this clear past action.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Excluded. The post goes beyond vague distress; it explicitly references a past suicide attempt.
   - **Ideation**: Excluded. While passive ideation (""won’t wake up"") and future intent exist, the core of the post centers on a **past attempt**.
   - **Behavior**: Excluded. No specific plan, method, or imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"") is described. Preparations are absent.
   - **Attempt**: **Matches**. The phrase ""attempt properly again"" directly describes a past suicide attempt (even if incomplete or self-interrupted). Per the rules, any mention of a past attempt (with suicidal intent) overrides concurrent ideation or future risk.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly requests someone to kill the user (""looking for someone to kill me"") and expresses a desire to disappear permanently (""so that my family will never find out,"" ""i never get found again""). This is a direct expression of wanting to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair and hopelessness are implied (e.g., willingness to be dismembered to avoid discovery).  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are implied (""chop me up,"" ""harvest my organs"") and preparations are described (hiding the body to avoid discovery).  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes **current/future intentions** (""looking for someone""), not past events. No mention of prior attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is **strongly implied** (requesting assisted death/disappearance).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods (dismemberment, organ harvesting) and **preparations** (hiding the body) are present.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **imminent future actions** (""looking for someone""), not past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (vague distress) due to explicit death-seeking intent.  
   - It surpasses *Ideation* (thoughts without plans) by detailing methods/preparations.  
   - It does not describe a *past* action (ruling out *Attempt*).  
   - **Behavior** fits best: explicit suicidal intent **combined with specific methods/preparations** (body disposal plan).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death,"" indicating a direct engagement with self-harm ideation.  
   - Emotional indicators include frustration (""fed up""), hopelessness (""none of it matters""), and persistent internal struggle (""fighting down suicidal thoughts"").  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are described.  
   - References to past events (""10 years"") describe ongoing thoughts, not actions taken. The phrase ""I have no desire to die"" is contradicted by later admission of ""some days I consider it,"" maintaining suicidal ideation as a current struggle.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit terms like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death"" are used.  
   - **Yes**: Strongly implied desire via persistent ideation (""fighting down,"" ""consider it""), despite a stated lack of active desire.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No methods, tools, locations, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes a chronic pattern (""10 years,"" ""every day"") of thoughts and suppression efforts. No past or current actions/attempts are indicated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post centers on **explicit suicidal thoughts** (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death"") and internal conflict (""fighting down,"" ""consider it"").  
   - Lacks plans, methods, or behaviors (e.g., acquiring means, setting a timeframe).  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Strong expressions of suicidal desire without actionable steps. The denial (""no desire to die"") is outweighed by admitted consideration, aligning with passive-to-active ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post contains direct expressions like ""I just really wish to end my life,"" ""end all this,"" and ""I just can't harm myself."" These are explicit statements of suicidal desire.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I don't have any more options""), worthlessness (""I'm unimportant""), and despair (envy of others' support) are present.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, tools), preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or actions taken are mentioned. The user explicitly states, ""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest,"" ruling out concrete steps.  
   - **Temporal Context**: All references are to current/future intentions (""wish to end my life,"" ""end all this"") with no mention of past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**, suicide is explicitly stated (""wish to end my life"") and strongly implied (""end all this"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific methods or preparations**. The user emphasizes an inability to act (""I just can't harm myself"").  
   - **No imminent intent** (e.g., timing like ""tonight"") is indicated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses solely on current/future ideation; **no past attempts** described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal desire** (""wish to end my life"") but lacks plans, methods, preparations, or actions. The statement ""I can't harm myself"" confirms no behavioral steps.  
   - Emotional distress (hopelessness, worthlessness) supports suicidal intent but does not elevate the classification without actionable elements.  
   - **Rules Applied**:  
     - Explicit ideation without plans/preparations → **Ideation**.  
     - ""I can't harm myself"" negates 'behavior' or 'attempt'.  
     - No past attempts → Not 'attempt'.  
     - Explicit intent → Not 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress (""I just want to cry,"" ""I can't breathe,"" ""I want to scream help please"") and a sense of losing control.  
   - The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" implies a desire to escape recurring pain but **lacks explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent** (e.g., no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm).  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**. Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied. Phrases like ""I don't want to live this again"" suggest avoidance of suffering, not a desire to die. Emotional distress alone is insufficient for ideation.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to recurring distress (""live this again"") but **no past attempts** or future plans involving suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it"" strongly implies suicidal intent. ""This is it"" contextually indicates a final decision to end life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""It’s too hard""), frustration (""my family doesn’t listen""), and despair (""I’m tired"") are present but secondary to explicit intent.  
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: **Yes**. Writing a suicide note (""I left a note"") is a documented preparatory action.  
   - **Past Attempts**: No mention of prior suicide actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied via ""decided this is it"" + emotional context (desperation about unaddressed trauma). → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific preparation: Writing a suicide note is a concrete action. → **Yes** (qualifies as behavior).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The note was written in the past (""I left a note""), but the phrase ""this is it"" implies ongoing intent. No explicit past attempt described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core evidence is **preparation** (leaving a suicide note).  
   - This fits the **Behavior** definition: ""preparations or actions taken"" (e.g., writing a note) alongside suicidal intent (""decided this is it"").  
   - *Not Attempt*: No description of initiating an actual self-harm act.  
   - *Not Ideation*: Goes beyond thoughts due to tangible preparation.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone.

Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - Direct statements: ""I just. Want. To die."" (explicit desire to die) and ""How do I kill myself..."" (explicit method inquiry).  
     - Strong emotional context: Profound hopelessness (""I don't deserve anything""), self-loathing (""I’m a creep""), and burden perception (""I don’t want to be a burden anymore"").  
     - **Verdict**: Yes to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - Actively seeks a method: ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?""  
     - This implies logistical planning (avoiding body discovery) and preparation.  
     - **Verdict**: Specific method inquiry + implicit preparation (body disposal concerns).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, phrases like *""push me over the edge,"" ""I'll be free from it all,""* and *""eternal void""* strongly imply a desire to escape life via self-destructive means. The tone conveys a clear wish to end suffering through death.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Extreme hopelessness (*""No point in it all,"" ""no point of moving on""*), worthlessness (*""people are starting to lose hope in me""*), and isolation (*""I wasn’t meant for this world""*).  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., buying tools). Imminent timing is suggested (*""One last push is all I need""*), but no concrete plan is described.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intentions (*""I’ll be free,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally""*). No reference to past attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **strongly implied suicidal intent** (e.g., craving a ""push"" to be ""free"" and embracing the ""eternal void""), aligning with *Ideation*.  
   - Despite urgency (*""One last push""*), no method, plan, or action is specified, ruling out *Behavior* or *Attempt*. Severe hopelessness alone doesn’t qualify as *Indicator* due to the implied intent to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post uses the term ""commit suicide,"" but this is a generalized statement about *others* (""people who commit suicide""). No first-person expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I’m going to die soon"") are present. The phrase ""we’ve bottled everything up"" refers to a collective experience, not the author’s personal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Mentions ""painful emotions,"" ""bottled up"" feelings, and ""break[ing] down,"" indicating distress or hopelessness. However, these are framed as explanations for others’ actions, not the author’s current state.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., tools, locations, timing like ""tonight"") are described for the author.
   - **Temporal Context**: Discusses past behaviors (""bottled everything up"") and hypothetical scenarios (""people get to that place""), but no references to the author’s past attempts or current/future plans.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is mentioned indirectly (""commit suicide""), but only in a general context. **No** first-person explicit/implicit desire to die.

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong anger, resentment, and hopelessness are present (e.g., ""fuck everyone,"" ""I dont owe anybody shit""), but these reinforce suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, actions, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The focus is on intent and posthumous messaging.  
   - **Past Attempts or Actions**: No references to past suicide attempts or self-harm actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""leave this world forever"").

Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key elements**: The post expresses profound hopelessness (""I can't fucking function in this world""), isolation (""not talking to a single person""), and self-loathing (""I can't motivate myself to shower""). Critically, it includes explicit future-oriented suicidal intent: ""Where do I see myself in five years? **Dead**.""  
   - **Explicit suicide mentions**: Yes. ""Dead"" is a direct, unambiguous expression of a desire to die/not be alive, framed as an inevitability.  
   - **Plan/method identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal context**: The suicidal reference (""Dead"") is future-focused (""in five years""), not a past action or immediate plan.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core distinction lies in the **explicit desire to die** (""Dead"") without details of planning, preparation, or past actions.  
   - This aligns with **Ideation**: The post shows active suicidal thoughts (wishing for death as a solution to suffering) but lacks actionable steps (methods/preparations) or references to past attempts.  
   - *Why not Indicator?* ""Dead"" transcends vague distress; it is an explicit declaration of a wish to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - ""I been suicidal since I was 10 or 11"" (explicit mention).  
     - ""suicide by a train is on my mind"" (explicit mention).  
     - ""I’m planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" (strongly implied intent).  
     - **Verdict**: **Yes** to explicit/implied suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - Specific method: ""suicide by a train"" + ""put neck on the train tracks.""  
     - Preparations/Intent: ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" (future intent with method).  
     - **Verdict**: **Yes** to specific method and future plan.  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Past: Describes childhood ideation (""thought jumping in and drowning"") but no action taken (stopped by mother).  
     - Present/Future: Current ideation (""suicide by a train is on my mind"") + future plan (""on my 18th birthday"").  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes **explicit suicidal ideation** (""suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train"").  
   - It details a **specific method** (train tracks) and **preparatory intent** with a timeline (""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"").  
   - The past event (childhood) describes interrupted *ideation*, not an attempt (no action was initiated).  
   - **Conclusion**: The combination of active suicidal thoughts + specific plan/method + future intent aligns with **Behavior** (defined as suicidal thoughts with a plan/preparations).

I had a few rougher weeks lately and heard that someone who I know tried to end his life. Since then I keep thinking about it. It used to be something that wasn´t that ""real"" something I would think about, but it seemed more unattainable. It´s like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try. I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post references ""suicidal thoughts"" and feeling triggered by another’s suicide attempt. Phrases like ""it’s now ok to try"" strongly imply openness to suicidal ideation but lack direct expressions of *current* intent to die (e.g., no ""I want to die now"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Distress and unwanted thoughts are present (""I don’t want to think like this anymore""), but no explicit hopelessness tied to active suicidal desire.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, timelines, or actions are described (e.g., no pills, notes, or ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on recurring *thoughts* (""I keep thinking about it"") triggered by a past event. Past suicidal thoughts are acknowledged but framed as historical (""most of them are behind me""). No mention of personal past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Strongly implied ideation?** Yes (""opens a window for me that it’s now ok to try"").  
   - **Direct desire to die?** No – current language centers on intrusive thoughts, not active intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Methods/preparations?** None.  
   - **Imminent intent?** No – vague phrasing (""ok to try"") lacks urgency or immediacy.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Past events**: References historical suicidal thoughts, not attempts.  
   - **Current/future intent**: Describes persistent ideation without plans/actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post confirms suicidal ideation (""I keep thinking about it"") with implied openness to acting (""ok to try""), but lacks plans, methods, preparations, or references to personal attempts.  
   - **Indicator?** No – explicit suicidal thoughts move beyond vague distress.  
   - **Behavior/Attempt?** No – no plans, actions, or past attempts described.  
   - **Ideation?** Yes – recurring suicidal thoughts without concrete steps align with this category.

377,"Stop please. I can't even do work, be productive, stay hydrated without having intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions, rage outbursts, followed by depressive episodes just want my life to end",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""just want my life to end"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent (desire to cease living). This is not vague hopelessness but a direct expression of wanting death.  
     - *Explicit/Implied Suicide Mention*: **Yes**  
     - *Expression of Wanting to Die*: **Yes**  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Mentions ""intrusive thoughts,"" ""rage outbursts,"" and ""depressive episodes"" indicate severe distress but are secondary to the explicit suicidal desire.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
     - *Method/Plan*: **No**  
     - *Preparations/Imminence*: **No**  
   - **Temporal Context**: The phrase ""just want my life to end"" reflects **current/future intentions**. No references to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core statement (""just want my life to end"") meets the threshold for **Ideation** (explicitly implied desire to die).  
   - It lacks specifics about plans, methods, or actions, ruling out **Behavior** and **Attempt**.  
   - While distress is severe, the suicidal intent elevates it beyond **Indicator** (which requires no explicit/implicit desire to die).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains both direct and implied suicidal expressions:  
     - Direct: ""nearly killing myself one night"" (past action).  
     - Strong implication: ""it'll only take one day where I step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" (specific method + intent).  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe dissociation, numbness, hopelessness, and feeling disconnected from life are present, but these are secondary to explicit suicidal references.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**:  
     - Specific methods: ""step off a building or over a bridge.""  
     - Preparation/action: Past action (""nearly killing myself"") and imminent future intent (""it'll only take one day"").  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Past: ""nearly killing myself one night"" (incomplete/interrupted attempt).  
     - Future: ""step off a building or over a bridge"" (current ideation with method + implied imminence).  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** (""nearly killing myself one night""), which fits the *Attempt* category (incomplete action with intent).  
   - Though future intent/methods are mentioned (""step off a building""), the *Attempt* category takes precedence per rules: *""If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear.""*  
   - The dissociation/distress alone would be an *Indicator*, but explicit past suicidal action overrides this.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""i want to take myself out"" is a strong euphemism for suicide, implying a direct desire to end one's life. This goes beyond vague distress (e.g., ""shits not worth it"" alone would be ambiguous). Emotional indicators like feeling like a ""burden"" and needing ""a way out"" reinforce hopelessness tied to suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned. The user expresses fear of pain (""i'm scared it'll be painful"") but no preparations, timelines, or actions are described.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on current feelings (""i want,"" ""i just need it to stop"") with no reference to past attempts or actions.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal intent** (""take myself out"") without detailing a plan, method, or preparatory actions. Fear of pain suggests contemplation but not progression toward action.
   - This aligns with **Ideation**: strong suicidal desire is present, but no concrete steps (methods/preparations) or past attempts are indicated. General distress (e.g., ""disappoint and burden"") supports suicidal intent but isn't standalone for ""indicator.""

   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - ""the more I want to die"" is a direct expression of wanting to die (Yes).  
     - No ambiguous phrasing; intent is clear (strongly implied suicidal desire).  
   - **Emotional Indicators**:  
     - Hopelessness (""Can't be fucked with anything anymore"") and despair (""Screw this"") are present but secondary to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., gathering tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Refers to ongoing feelings (""the more I live...""), not past actions or attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly states a desire to die (""want to die""), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions rules out **Behavior** and **Attempt**.  
   - General distress (""Can't be fucked..."") alone would be **Indicator**, but explicit suicidal intent overrides this.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""contemplating"" (strongly implying suicidal ideation), ""thinking on how to die painlessly,"" and ""I want to die."" These are direct expressions of a desire to end life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I’m a burnout,"" ""no one will care when I’m gone""), shame (""coward,"" ""useless""), and despair over family conflict.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - ""emails to send to my parents **before I do it**"" strongly implies suicidal intent (""do it"" = suicide).  
     - ""So many people **commit suicide**"" contextualizes the writer's mindset.  
     - ""I've only **thought about killing myself** for 5 years"" is an explicit admission of suicidal ideation.  
     - **Verdict**: Yes (explicit/implicit suicidal intent present).  
   - **Emotional Indicators**:  
     - Extreme hopelessness (""My life is ruined""), hatred (""I hate everything and everyone""), and despair (""I’ve been shoveling shit for 30+ years"").  
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**:  
     - Preparatory action: ""I hate how I have **emails to send to my parents before I do it**"" indicates concrete steps (drafting final communications).  
     - Imminent intent: ""before I do it"" implies timing tied to sending emails.  
     - **Verdict**: Yes (preparatory behavior identified).  
   - **Past Attempts**:  
     - No references to past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried but stopped""). Mentions only ongoing ideation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. ""Killing myself"" is explicit, and ""before I do it"" strongly implies intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Drafting final emails (""emails to send... before I do it"") is a recognized preparatory behavior in suicide risk assessment.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Ideation is ongoing (""5 years nonstop""), but preparatory action (emails) is current/future-focused. No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No. Explicit suicidal ideation and preparatory actions rule this out.  
   - **Ideation?** Insufficient. While ideation is present (""thought about killing myself""), the email preparation moves beyond thoughts.  
   - **Behavior?** **Yes**. The post includes:  
     - Explicit suicidal ideation (""killing myself"").  
     - Preparatory actions (drafting final emails with stated intent to act ""before I do it"").  
     - Imminent timing implied (""before I do it"").  
   - **Attempt?** No. No description of a past/current initiated attempt (e.g., ""I tried"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrases ""Ending it soon"" and ""I’m taking it all as soon as it gets here"" strongly imply suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include severe depression, hopelessness (""fucked me up for good""), and fear of losing critical support.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Specifics are provided: the method (ingesting ""14 grams of dextromethorphan""), preparation (""ordered... in the mail""), and imminent timing (""as soon as it gets here"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to future intent (""soon,"" ""as soon as it gets here""), not past actions. No mention of prior attempts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or strongly implied references to suicide, death, self-harm, or ending life (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I’m going to kill myself""). The post questions the purpose of living and expresses existential despair but lacks suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""it wasn’t really good""), frustration (""60 fucking years left""), and disillusionment with life’s length. However, these remain philosophical, not actionable.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., notes), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on general future dread (""60 years more"") and past dissatisfaction (""15 years [...] not really good""). No past attempts or current plans described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS?**:  
   - Suicide not mentioned or implied. Despair is existential, not self-directed toward ending life. → **No**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Discusses lifetime duration hypothetically. No past/current suicidal actions. → **N/A**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post uses terms like ""suicide by cop,"" ""passive suicidal,"" and ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal,"" which explicitly reference suicidal states.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Frustration and criticism of others' actions, but no personal expressions of hopelessness, despair, or loneliness from the author.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: The method ""suicide by cop"" is mentioned, but only as a hypothetical outcome for others—not as the author’s personal plan or action.
   - **Temporal Context/Attempts**: No references to the author’s past/current actions, plans, or attempts. The focus is on general scenarios involving others.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author discusses suicidal concepts (e.g., ""suicide by cop"") but does **not** express personal suicidal intent, plans, preparations, or past attempts.  
   - The post critiques others’ behavior toward suicidal individuals, framing suicide as an abstract risk rather than disclosing the author’s own experience.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrases ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" and ""had a couple ideas for how to do it"" strongly imply suicidal intent. References to using insulin to end one’s life (""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"") further support this.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""Pretty sure I’ve been depressed for most of my life"") and shame (""I hate being a burden"") are present but secondary to suicidal implications.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are detailed (insulin overdose via pump), including accessibility (""most accessible"") and preparation (waiting for the pump if their condition worsens). Imminent timing is implied (""might be the way I choose to go"").
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. Mentions of ""thought about doing it a couple times"" refer to ideation, not actions taken. The phrase ""didn’t because it was such a hassle"" confirms no attempt occurred.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied (""choose to go,"" ""ideas for how to do it"").

   - **Verdict**: Yes.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Insulin overdose via pump (""100s of units at the press of a button"").  
   - Preparations: Awaiting pump access contingent on health decline.  
   - Imminent intent: Not immediate (""might be""), but the concrete plan elevates risk beyond ideation.  
   - **Verdict**: Yes.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past: Ideation only (""thought about doing it""). No actions or attempts.  
   - Present/Future: Plans are conditional (pump access) but explicitly described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal implications.  
   - **Ideation**: Excluded—specific plans/methods move this beyond passive thoughts.  
   - **Behavior**: Fits best. The post details a method (insulin pump), preparations (awaiting access), and conditional intent (""if it gets bad"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""kill yourself"" is explicit. The statement ""well I do and I have a chance right now"" directly expresses a current desire to act on suicidal thoughts.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I’m just tired of everything""), despair (""Worst birthday ever""), and perceived rejection (""nobody told me happy birthday"").
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: No specific method is mentioned, but imminent intent is clear (""I have a chance right now"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to current intent (""right now"") with no mention of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill yourself"") and paired with current intent (""right now""). **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No method or preparation is described. However, imminent timing (""right now"") indicates strong intent to act.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on present intent, not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post moves beyond vague distress (Indicator) due to explicit suicidal language.  
   - It exceeds Ideation (thoughts without action) because of imminent intent (""right now"").  
   - **Behavior** applies here: The combination of explicit suicidal desire + imminent timing (even without a method) aligns with the category definition.  
   - Attempt is ruled out as no past/current concrete action is described.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes the explicit phrase ""I'm finally considering suicide."" Additional statements like ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit"" strongly imply a desire to escape life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""It feels incredibly desolate""), despair (""crying myself to sleep""), isolation (""My 'friends' have all left me""), and perceived burdensomeness (""I honestly wouldn’t give a shit if it weren’t for my parents"").  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) are mentioned. No imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: None. The user states they ""never thought about [suicide]"" before now.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit mention: **Yes** (""considering suicide"").  
   - Direct/implied desire to die: **Yes** (rhetorical questions about death and futility of life).  
   - Emotional context confirms intent beyond vague distress.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods mentioned: **No**.  
   - Preparations/actions: **No**.  
   - Imminent intent: **No** (timing references are general, e.g., ""it's only 2 weeks"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to **current/future** suicidal ideation (""finally considering suicide now"").  
   - **No past attempts** described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal intent** (""considering suicide"") and despair but lacks:  
     - Specific plans/methods.  
     - Preparations or actions taken.  
     - References to past attempts.  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Clear desire to die without concrete steps toward action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""attempted to end my life,"" ""almost committed,"" and ""kill myself"" are direct references to suicide.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Descriptions of shaking, crying, feeling like a ""shell,"" and intense distress are present, but these support suicidal intent rather than standalone distress.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific methods are mentioned (cutting wrists/thighs with a knife). Actions taken include bleeding from self-inflicted wounds and holding the knife.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes a recent, concrete action (""I just attempted,"" ""I was ready,"" ""I put down my knife""). This is a past incomplete attempt (self-interrupted).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""end my life,"" ""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""almost committed""). **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (knife) and physical evidence (bleeding wrists/thighs) are described. Actions were initiated but stopped. **Yes**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to a past event (""just attempted"") with immediate physical consequences (bleeding). The attempt was interrupted by the user (""put down my knife"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post details a **concrete, self-interrupted suicide attempt** with clear intent, methods, and actions taken. This meets the ""Attempt"" definition (past incomplete action with suicidal intent). Current emotional distress does not override the explicit description of an attempt.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct expressions of suicidal intent:  
     *""I know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't.""*  
     *""when I do [talk to my parents] I feel like killing myself.""*  
     These are unambiguous declarations of a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong themes of hopelessness (e.g., *""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it""*), despair, loneliness, and feeling trapped.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.
   - **Past Attempts**: Explicitly denied: *""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to.""*  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. Suicidal intent is directly stated (""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""I would [kill myself] if I had the guts"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No evidence of planning, preparation, or imminent intent. The post focuses on *desire* without actionable steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct statements like ""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape,"" and ""slit my wrists with some scissors."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: The author describes hopelessness (e.g., ""What’s the point of attending or trying when I’m going to fail?"") and despair, but these are secondary to the explicit suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are mentioned (""slit my wrists with some scissors""), and preparations are detailed (""I’ve already written my suicide note and put it on my notes app""). Imminent timing is emphasized (""tonight,"" ""when everyone is going to bed"").
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. The post describes preparations (writing a note) but no past or current actions constituting an attempt (e.g., no mention of initiating self-harm).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Suicide Explicitly Mentioned or Strongly Implied?** Yes. Phrases like ""Killing myself"" and ""ending my life"" are direct.  
   - **Expressions of Wanting to Die?** Yes. ""Killing myself is the only escape"" conveys a clear desire to die.  
   - **Emotional Context**: Severe distress is present but reinforced by explicit intent, moving beyond vague hopelessness.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific Methods Mentioned?** Yes (""slit my wrists with some scissors"").  
   - **Preparations or Actions Taken?** Yes (writing and saving a suicide note).  
   - **Imminent Intent?** Yes (""tonight""). This indicates concrete steps toward action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""tonight"") and current preparations (note written). No past attempts are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes explicit suicidal intent (e.g., ""ending my life tonight"") and specific methods/preparations (note written, plan to use scissors). This aligns with the **Behavior** category, defined as suicidal thoughts with a plan, preparations, or imminent intent. It does not describe a past or ongoing attempt (ruling out ""Attempt""), and the presence of concrete steps exceeds ""Ideation"" or ""Indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post directly states ""my plan to kill myself,"" which is an explicit reference to suicide. The euthanasia analogy (""preventing someone to get euthanized"") strongly implies a desire to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Frustration (""what the fuck""), betrayal (""snitched""), and helplessness (family ""watching me"" to prevent action).  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: The phrase ""my plan"" confirms a concrete suicidal plan, even if specifics (e.g., method) are omitted. Family intervention (""watching me"") implies the plan was actionable.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a past plan (""told family my plan"") and current prevention efforts (""now they're watching""), but no description of a past *attempt*.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Explicit mention**: Yes (""kill myself"").  
   - **Expressions of wanting to die**: Strongly implied (euthanasia comparison).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method**: Not detailed, but ""plan"" confirms intent beyond ideation.  
   - **Preparations/actions**: Family intervention suggests the plan was credible enough to warrant monitoring.  
   - **Imminent intent**: Not stated, but the plan’s disclosure and prevention imply it was actionable.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on a past plan and current consequences. No mention of a past attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit suicidal intent (""plan to kill myself"") paired with a confirmed plan moves this beyond *ideation*.  
   - No described *attempt* (no action taken).  
   - Falls under **Behavior**: Explicit suicidal thoughts + specific plan (even if undisclosed), validated by family intervention.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct, explicit statement of suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Isolation (""minimally interact with everyone except kids"") and concern for the child's safety (""I hope my baby ends up safe"") imply despair and hopelessness.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: A specific timeline (""3 weeks from now"") is stated, indicating imminent intent. While no method is specified, the clear timeframe and preparatory isolation (""I won’t reach out"") signal actions toward suicide.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes future intentions (""then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now""), not past events.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit Intent**: ""Kill myself"" confirms suicidal ideation.  
   - **Behavior Criteria**: The post includes strong intent + imminent timing (""3 weeks from now"") and preparatory actions (isolating socially). This aligns with the ""Behavior"" category, which covers explicit intent with timing/preparations even without a method.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past/initiated action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""Would this kill me"" strongly implies suicidal intent. While not using direct terms like ""suicide,"" it questions the lethality of specific substances, indicating a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Despair is inferred from the focus on self-harm methods.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific substances (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, alcohol) and quantities (""3 bottles,"" ""30 pills"") are listed, demonstrating a concrete plan. The question about lethality confirms active consideration of method.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post is present-focused (""Would this...""), indicating imminent intent rather than past events. No mention of prior attempts.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit implied intent (""Would this kill me"").
   - **Ideation**: Insufficient—specific methods/preparations elevate beyond passive thoughts.
   - **Behavior**: Fits best. The post details a method (substance combination) and quantities, showing preparation and imminent intent. The lethality question confirms active planning.
   - **Attempt**: No evidence of action taken (e.g., ""I took..."").

   - The post includes **suicidal intent** (""can’t keep going"") + **preparatory action** (writing a note). This fits **Behavior** (preparations/actions taken).  
   - *Not Indicator*: Explicit intent and action go beyond general distress.  
   - *Not Ideation*: Specific action (note) moves beyond thoughts alone.  
   - *Not Attempt*: No description of a past/current suicide *act* (e.g., self-harm).

399,Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.,3,attempt,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. ""Tried to end my life again"" explicitly references suicide.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method is mentioned, but ""tried"" implies an action was taken. ""Didn’t work"" confirms a failed effort.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Past tense (""tried,"" ""didn’t work"") indicates a completed action. ""Again"" confirms recurrence.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** (""tried to end my life"") that failed (""didn’t work"").  
   - This aligns with the **Attempt** category: ""describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete [...] actions.""  
   - No current/future plans or methods are mentioned, ruling out *Behavior*. Explicit suicidal action places it beyond *Ideation* or *Indicator*.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct references to suicide, death, dying, or self-harm (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all""). Phrases like ""I feel hopeless"" and ""I really don’t know what to do anymore"" indicate distress but lack explicit or strong implied suicidal intent (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I won’t be here tomorrow"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I feel hopeless""), frustration (""nothing has helped""), and physical suffering. However, these are tied to medical struggles, not overt suicidal desire.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of suicide methods, preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on past/ongoing medical experiences (e.g., ""this all happened 7 months ago,"" ""so far nothing has helped""). No references to past suicide attempts or future plans to act on suicidal thoughts.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes severe distress and hopelessness due to unresolved physical symptoms but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent**, plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.
   - Emotional suffering alone (e.g., ""hopeless"") is insufficient for ""ideation""; per the rules, suicidal intent must be explicit or strongly implied to move beyond ""indicator.""
   - Fits the **Indicator** definition: ""General distress without a clear desire to die.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" and ""slit my fucking throat"" are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong self-loathing (""I’m a self-absorbed whiny piece of shit""), hopelessness (""there is no better""), and worthlessness (""I’m just a fucking monster"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are mentioned: ""bullet in my head"" and ""slit my fucking throat.""  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current desires (e.g., ""I deserve to die,"" ""I wish someone would...""), not past actions. No reference to prior attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit or implied desire to die: **Yes** (""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head"").  
   - Severe distress with implied intent: **Yes** (supports ideation/behavior).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods mentioned: **Yes** (firearm, throat-slitting).  
   - Preparations/actions: **No** (user states ""I have no plans"").  
   - Imminent intent: **No** (no time frame like ""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current/future intentions: **Yes** (e.g., ""I deserve to die"").  
   - Past attempts: **No**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal intent** (""I deserve to die"") and **specific methods** (bullet, throat-slitting), fitting the **Behavior** category.  
   - Despite disclaimers (""no plans""), mentioning methods moves it beyond *Ideation*. Absence of imminent timing or preparations prevents *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""the second they're gone, so am I"" strongly implies suicidal intent, framing the user's continued existence as contingent on their parents' survival. This goes beyond vague distress (e.g., ""life isn’t worth living"") and directly links their death to a future event.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness""), hopelessness (""what's the fucking point?""), worthlessness (""I'm a hideous fucking mutant""), and isolation (""I will die alone"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., buying tools), or actions are mentioned. The timeline (""the second they're gone"") is future-oriented but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal intent is future-focused (""the second they're gone""). No references to past attempts or actions.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out. The post includes strongly implied suicidal intent (""so am I""), not just general distress.
   - **Behavior**: Ruled out. Despite strong suicidal ideation, there is no specific plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Attempt**: Ruled out. No description of past or current suicide actions.
   - **Ideation**: Best fit. The post expresses explicit desire to die (""so am I"") linked to future conditions, with severe emotional distress but no actionable plans or behaviors.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The user explicitly mentions ""suicidal urges"" and ""thinking of killing myself,"" directly expressing a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong guilt, hopelessness, and preoccupation with the impact of suicide on loved ones (e.g., ""hate myself for thinking of killing myself,"" ""guilty downward spiral"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The user states, ""I have a plan but no date set,"" confirming a specific suicide plan exists, even if timing is undetermined.
   - **Temporal Context**: Current/future intentions (""bad urges tonight,"" ""this might be our last conversation""). No past attempts described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is explicit (""suicidal urges,"" ""killing myself"").  
   - Expressions of wanting to die are direct and unambiguous.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A specific plan is disclosed (""I have a plan"").  
   - No imminent timing (""no date set""), but the presence of a concrete plan shifts beyond ideation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current urges and future intentions, not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Ideation**: Excluded because a specific plan exists.  
   - **Behavior**: Fits perfectly—explicit suicidal intent + specific plan (even without date/imminence).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly references ""suicidal thoughts"" and acknowledges lying about them to avoid consequences.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong distress (""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"") and hopelessness, but these support suicidal intent rather than standalone distress.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on *current* suicidal thoughts (""it starts to happen more and more frequently"") with no references to past attempts or actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Suicide Explicitly Mentioned?** Yes (""suicidal thoughts"").  
   - **Expressions of Wanting to Die?** Implicitly yes (lying about thoughts implies their presence).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent. The avoidance of disclosure stresses ideation, not action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Concerns ongoing/frequent suicidal thoughts, not past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core is **explicit suicidal ideation** (""suicidal thoughts,"" frequency increasing) without plans, methods, or actions.  
   - Avoidance of disclosure reflects fear of consequences, not behavioral steps.  
   - Emotional distress (""grave I dug myself"") reinforces ideation but doesn’t escalate to behavior.  
   - Matches **Ideation**: Explicit thoughts without plans/preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""bullied me into nearly killing myself"" explicitly references suicide (""killing myself""). The emotional context includes despair (""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"") and explicit hatred of life (""I fucking hate living"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or active preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. The phrase ""shooting up the school"" references violent ideation but is tied to past bullying, not a current suicide plan.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes a past event: ""nearly killing myself"" indicates an incomplete or interrupted suicide attempt. The current language (""I fucking hate living"") expresses ongoing distress but does not describe imminent intent or new actions.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core of the post hinges on the statement ""nearly killing myself,"" which clearly describes a past suicide attempt (interrupted by external factors—bullying). This fits the **Attempt** category definition: ""a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions.""  
   - While the post includes current emotional distress and passive suicidal ideation (""I fucking hate living""), the explicit reference to a past attempt takes precedence per the rules. Even with concurrent ideation, the category defaults to ""attempt"" when a past attempt is disclosed.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post directly references a suicide attempt (""Survived OD,"" ""kill yourself with ibuprofen"") and states intent (""I wanted to [die]"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness and guilt are present (e.g., ""I feel stupid,"" ""I feel bad""), but these are secondary to the explicit description of a suicide attempt.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are detailed: swallowing ""120+ pills of ibuprofen"" combined with ""drank hard liquor."" Preparations/actions are confirmed (holding off hospital care).
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes a **past event**. Key phrases: ""Survived OD,"" ""I held off going to the hospital,"" and reflections on the aftermath (""still processing everything"").

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core of the post is a firsthand account of a **past suicide attempt** (overdose with pills/alcohol). This meets the ""Attempt"" definition: a concrete action with suicidal intent (consuming lethal means) that was interrupted (survived due to medical intervention). 
   - Mentions of guilt or confusion (""still feel weird calling it an OD"") do not override the clear description of an attempt. Current emotional distress is contextual, not the primary focus.
   - Rules applied: The attempt is by the author (not others), and past attempts supersede concurrent thoughts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""Suicide has become my quick solution,"" directly expressing suicidal intent. The phrase ""get away from it all"" strongly implies a desire to escape life through death.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Present (e.g., helplessness, paranoia, despair, alienation), but these are secondary to the explicit suicidal statement.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), preparation (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intentions (""Suicide has become...""). No references to past attempts or actions taken.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit statement ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" confirms **active suicidal intent**, placing this beyond *Indicator* (which lacks explicit/implied intent).
   - Absence of methods, preparations, or imminent timing rules out *Behavior*.
   - No description of past actions (e.g., ""I tried"") rules out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or strongly implied references to suicide, death, dying, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""suicide,"" or ""end my life""). The phrase ""*keep on keeping on*"" is a reference to a video game (Death Stranding) and conveys persistence, not suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I wonder if a long-term cure even exists""), emotional distress (""mangled psychically""), and isolation (""only depressed people can understand""). However, these lack explicit or implied suicidal desire.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on ongoing struggles with depression, not past attempts or future plans for self-harm.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes severe depression and hopelessness but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent, plans, or actions**. 
   - Falls under **Indicator** because:
     - Distress is generalized (e.g., ""hard to keep going,"" ""never really goes away"").
     - Vague references to suffering do not equate to a desire to die.
     - Meets the definition: *""general distress without clear desire to die.""*

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""it’s inevitable for me""), despair (""I’ve felt like shit for years""), and helplessness (""reliving the same day"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The user explicitly doubts acting: ""I’m probably too much of a pussy to ever do it.""
   - **Temporal Context**: Suicidal thoughts are current (""I get suicidal thoughts""). The father’s suicide is a past event, but no personal past attempts are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly referenced (""suicidal thoughts"") and strongly implied (""inevitable for me"").  
   - Expressions of wanting to die are present but passive due to self-doubt about acting.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, plans, or preparatory actions are described. The user dismisses likelihood of action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current ideation without past personal attempts or future intent with immediacy.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct statements like ""i wanna off myself"" and ""if i killed myself,"" which explicitly express a desire to die. Emotional context (hopelessness, despair) reinforces intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The fear of missing out and desire to ""hang onto hope"" suggest contemplation without concrete steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future intentions (""i wanna off myself"") without references to past attempts or actions. Therapy discontinuation is unrelated to suicidal behavior.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal desire (""off myself,"" ""killed myself"") but lacks plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions. The fear and ambivalence do not negate the clear ideation. This aligns with the **Ideation** category (explicit suicidal thoughts without actionable steps).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""I want to give up my life and just die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE,"" and ""suicidal thoughts are like eating me up."" These are direct expressions of suicidal desire.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I feel so hopeless,"" ""THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR ME""), self-loathing (""I hate myself""), and despair (""I FEEL TRAPED"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"") but lacks any specific plans, methods, or actions. The absence of preparation or reference to past attempts rules out ""Behavior"" and ""Attempt."" While distress is severe, explicit suicidal ideation places it beyond ""Indicator."" This aligns with the **Ideation** category: explicit desires to die without concrete steps.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The user states: ""For the past month I've been contemplating suicide,"" and explicitly declares, ""I'm ending it"" if the girl is gone. Strongly implied intent is also present (e.g., ""if she gone I’m not gonna try anymore"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""I don’t get any joy out of life""), numbness, and despair are noted, but suicidal intent is explicit.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method, preparation, or imminent timing is described for the user’s own actions. References to the girl’s method (cutting wrists) and their conditional pact (""we will do it together"") are future-oriented and lack concrete personal steps or immediacy.
   - **Temporal Context**: Suicidal thoughts are current (""contemplating suicide""), and the pact is a future conditional intent. No past suicide attempts by the user are described—only self-harm (cutting) as a coping mechanism.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal intent (""contemplating suicide,"" ""I’m ending it"").
   - **Behavior**: Excluded. Despite a conditional pact, there is no evidence of personal preparation, specific method, or imminent intent (e.g., no tools, locations, or timelines for the user’s own actions).
   - **Attempt**: Excluded. The user references the girl’s past attempt, but no personal suicide attempt is described. Self-harm (cutting) is distinct from a suicide attempt.
   - **Ideation**: Best fit. The post includes clear expressions of suicidal thoughts (""contemplating suicide"") and a desire to die (""I’m ending it""), but no actionable plans, methods, or preparatory steps by the user.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Direct statements include: ""Why is it frowned upon to kill yourself?"" and ""I need to die because it's better than living in pain."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""Life isn’t worth it""), despair (""I’m alone""), and feelings of being trapped (""I’m fucked"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The post focuses on justifying suicide as ""reasonable"" but lacks actionable steps.
   - **Temporal Context**: All suicidal expressions refer to current/future intentions (e.g., ""I need to die""). No past attempts or actions are described.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post explicitly desires death (""kill yourself,"" ""need to die""), meeting the threshold for **ideation**.
   - However, it lacks:  
     - Specific plans or methods (required for *behavior*).  
     - Descriptions of past actions (required for *attempt*).  
   - While emotional distress is severe, the explicit suicidal intent rules out *indicator*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Multiple direct quotes from parents include explicit commands (""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself already"") and mocking references to the user’s past actions (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe emotional distress is evident (hopelessness, worthlessness, family rejection), but the focus is on **others’ descriptions of the user’s past behaviors**.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Methods are explicitly mentioned by parents (e.g., ""shoot yourself,"" ""cut your wrists"").  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: **Yes**. The parents repeatedly reference the user’s past suicidal actions (e.g., ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?""), confirming concrete past suicide attempts or self-harm with intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit commands to die: **Yes** (e.g., ""kill yourself"").  
   - References to the user’s past suicidal actions: **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods (gun, cutting) are mentioned by parents, but **these are attributed to the user’s past behavior**, not current plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Past events dominate**. The post centers on parents recounting the user’s **historical suicide attempts** (e.g., ""try to kill yourself again,"" ""cut your wrists again"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post **describes past suicide attempts** (e.g., interrupted actions like cutting wrists or trying to kill oneself) through parental quotes.  
   - Per the rules:  
     - *Attempt* applies when a **past concrete action with suicidal intent** is confirmed (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself"").  
     - Here, parents directly state the user engaged in these behaviors.  
   - Despite emotional distress, the **core content is documentation of past attempts**, overriding current ideation/behavior cues.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - The post explicitly uses ""kill yourself"" and ""Kim's"" (likely a typo for ""end it"" or similar), indicating a direct desire to die.  
     - Strong implied intent: ""I just need a way"" and dismissal of encouragement to live.  
     - **Result**: Explicit mentions (Yes), expressions of wanting to die (Yes).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - The post explicitly asks for the ""least painful way,"" indicating active method-seeking.  
     - Urgency is implied (""someone just give me a straight up answer""), suggesting imminent intent.  
     - **Result**: Method inquiry (Yes), imminent intent (Yes).  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Focuses on current/future intentions (""I need a way""), not past events.  
     - No reference to prior attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit suicidal intent (""kill yourself"") and active search for methods elevate this beyond vague distress (Indicator).  
   - While expressing suicidal desire (Ideation), the method-seeking and urgency (""just give me a straight up answer"") indicate preparatory behavior.  
   - This aligns with **Behavior**: Explicit ideation + method identification + implied preparation.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""write a suicidal note"" explicitly references suicide. The word ""suicidal"" directly denotes intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe distress is evident (""stomach convulsing from pain""), reinforcing hopelessness.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Writing a suicide note is a recognized preparatory action (a concrete step toward suicide). The word ""again"" implies prior behavior.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a current/future action (""I’m going to write""). No past attempt described.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent (""suicidal note"") and includes a specific preparatory action (writing the note).  
   - This aligns with the **Behavior** category: suicidal thoughts coupled with preparations (writing a note qualifies, even without a method).  
   - *Not Ideation*: Ideation requires thoughts without actions. Here, the note is an action.  
   - *Not Attempt*: No description of a past or current suicide attempt.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond vague distress.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis  

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""slaying myself"" is a direct and explicit reference to suicide (synonymous with ""killing myself""). The alternative (""committing a massacre"") implies harm to others, but the focus is on the user’s self-directed intent (""slaying myself"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Desperation is implied (""I will end up""), but the core classification hinges on suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., tools, location) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are mentioned. The word ""maybe"" suggests uncertainty, not concrete planning.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Future intent (""will end up"") is indicated, but no past attempts or actions are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. ""Slaying myself"" is an unambiguous expression of suicidal desire.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are specified.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Future-oriented (""will end up""), with no reference to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""slaying myself""), aligning with **Ideation**.  
   - It lacks specifics about plans, methods, or actions, ruling out **Behavior** or **Attempt**.  
   - General distress (""I will end up..."") alone is insufficient for **Indicator** due to explicit suicidal intent.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest.

I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them.

Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post explicitly states, ""I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" This directly denies current suicidal intent while acknowledging past ideation as a byproduct of shame. No expressions of active desire to die or end life are present.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong themes of shame, loneliness, frustration, and feelings of inadequacy are evident (e.g., ""I feel so stupid,"" ""everything is overwhelming""). However, these are framed as barriers to action, not expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight""). The focus is on inaction and self-criticism, not concrete steps toward self-harm.
   - **Temporal Context**: References to suicidal ideation are explicitly tied to the past (""stems from shame"") and contextualized as resolved by the declaration ""I want to live."" No current/future plans or descriptions of past attempts exist.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes (""suicidal ideation""), but immediately negated by ""I don’t want to die.""  
   - **Expressions of wanting to die?** No. The denial of death wishes overrides implied intent.  
   - **Emotional context**: Severe distress exists, but suicidal ideation is framed as historical and disconnected from current intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent. The narrative centers on stagnation, not action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Ideation is past-tense (""stems from""), with no current/future intent or descriptions of attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post lacks **active** suicidal desire, plans, or behaviors. The fleeting mention of past ideation is explicitly disavowed and lacks concrete ties to action.  
   - Emotional distress (shame, hopelessness) is prominent but vague regarding suicide, aligning with **Indicator**, which captures distress without explicit/imminent suicidal intent.  
   - *Not Ideation*: Current ideation is absent; past references are downplayed.  
   - *Not Behavior/Attempt*: No plans, actions, or descriptions of attempts.

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness and distress are implied through the discussion of fear of disability and rejection of help resources.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method (using a handgun) and access (""get my dad's handgun"") are mentioned, but the user explicitly states they are ""not risking it"" due to fear of consequences.
   - **Preparations/Actions**: No evidence of actions taken (e.g., obtaining the gun or writing a note). The post emphasizes hesitation and inaction.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current thoughts (""wanna"") and hypothetical outcomes, not past attempts. No reference to prior actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Direct expression of suicidal intent (""shoot myself in the head"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. A method (firearm) is specified, but **no preparation or imminent intent** is indicated. The user actively rejects acting on the plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Current/future intentions are discussed hypothetically, with no past attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post contains **explicit suicidal ideation** with a specific method (handgun), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - However, it lacks **actionable steps** (e.g., obtaining the gun), **preparations**, or **imminent intent** (user states ""I’m not risking it""). This rules out *Behavior* or *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon"" and ""by February I think I'll be gone"" explicitly express suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""don’t see the point anymore"") and guilt (""kinda shitty"" about timing) are present but secondary to explicit intent.

   - **Temporal context**: The post focuses on future intent (""gonna end""), not past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct expressions like ""want to die"" and ""end my life"" leave no ambiguity.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts"" as part of the author's experience (""...my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughts helped me...""). This confirms a direct expression of suicidal ideation.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Present (e.g., suffering, pessimism, references to mental illness), but these contextualize rather than replace the explicit suicidal ideation.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No. No specific methods, preparations, actions, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to ongoing struggles (""I'm suffering,"" ""suicidal thoughts"") without describing past attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit mention: **Yes** (""suicidal thoughts"").  
   - Expressions of wanting to die: **Yes** (implied through ownership of suicidal thoughts).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""thinking of ending it all"" strongly implies suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I’m a failure,"" ""I don’t deserve love""), self-blame (""all bad things happen because of me""), and isolation (""fighting this battle alone"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method, plan, preparation, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") mentioned.  
   - **Past Attempts**: No reference to previous suicide attempts or actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - ""Ending it all"" is a strong implication of suicidal desire → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent described → **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current thoughts (""I’ve been thinking""), not past actions → **Current ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I want to get it over with,"" and ""my death will be following very soon"" strongly imply suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""It's probably best""), guilt (""I feel kind of sorry for my mom""), and distress about impacting others.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - The phrase ""cannot live if I fail"" strongly implies suicidal intent tied to a specific outcome (failing the test).  
     - References to methods (""no access to my meds,"" ""no place to jump from,"" ""blades"") confirm suicidal ideation.  
     - *Verdict: Yes*.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - Methods are mentioned (overdose, jumping, cutting), but all are framed as *currently inaccessible* (""no access,"" ""no place,"" ""blades won't go that deep"").  
     - No active preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are stated.  
     - *Verdict: No specific plan/preparation*.
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Focuses on a *future* contingency (""if I fail"") with no description of past attempts.  
     - Barriers (e.g., lack of means) reduce immediacy but don’t negate intent.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post expresses a conditional desire to die (""cannot live if I fail"") with method awareness, placing it beyond vague distress (**Indicator**).  
   - However, the absence of actionable steps (methods are unavailable, no preparations) or imminent intent rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No past actions are described, so **Attempt** does not apply.  
   - **Ideation** fits best: Strong implied intent (""cannot live if I fail"") and method references, but no active steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key Elements**: The post expresses profound hopelessness, exhaustion, disillusionment with societal systems, and feelings of being exploited (""milked out of work labor""). It highlights emotional distress (e.g., ""drained me the fuck out,"" ""taken my will to strive,"" ""I don’t know what to do anymore"").
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: **No**. There are no direct or implied references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or a desire to end life (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""end it all""). Emotional distress is present but lacks suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: **No**. No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""), or actions taken toward self-harm.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on ongoing feelings (""neverending process"") with no references to past attempts or future plans involving self-harm.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes severe hopelessness and existential despair but **lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent, plans, or actions**. It aligns with ""Indicator"" (distress without suicidal ideation).  
   - **Why not higher categories?**

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases include ""kill myself by slitting my wrist,"" ""shoot myself with a gun,"" and ""start cutting myself"" (self-harm as a precursor). Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""My existence has been nothing but depression""), worthlessness (""net gain for the world if I die""), self-loathing (""I fucking hate myself""), and hopelessness (""waiting for the end"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are named (""slitting my wrist,"" ""shoot myself with a gun""). Preparatory intent is implied (""Once I get a place... I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on future intent (""Once I get a place... I'll..."") with no references to past attempts. Imminent timing is not explicit (e.g., no ""tonight"").
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions Confirmed**: Explicitly stated (""kill myself,"" ""die""). Strong emotional context reinforces intent.
   - **Plan/Method Confirmed**: Methods are specific, and logistical preparation (""get a place"") suggests behavioral escalation beyond ideation.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent and methods.
   - **Ideation**: Suicidal thoughts are present, but the specificity of methods (""slit wrist,"" ""shoot myself"") and preparatory language (""Once I get a place... I'll"") exceed passive ideation.
   - **Behavior**: Fits best. The post combines explicit suicidal intent with specific methods and implied preparation (securing a location). The absence of past attempts or active initiation prevents classification as ""attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No. The post expresses intense emotional distress (e.g., ""I just want someone to goddamn love me,"" ""I want to cry my damn eyes out"") but lacks explicit or strongly implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Phrases like ""this world is shit"" or ""I’m so unlovable"" indicate hopelessness but do not convey a desire to end life.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No. There are no mentions of suicide methods, preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: No. The post discusses current emotional struggles and past relationship trauma but does not reference past suicide attempts or future plans to act on suicidal thoughts.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Present (e.g., despair, abandonment issues, paranoia, PTSD references). However, these align with general distress rather than suicidal intent.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post fits **Indicator**: It shows severe distress, isolation, and hopelessness but lacks explicit/implied suicidal ideation, plans, or references to past attempts. The core focus is on emotional pain and confusion (e.g., questioning reality, feeling unloved), not a desire to die. Per the rules, severe hopelessness alone without suicidal intent remains in this category.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post states ""I wanna kill myself"" and ""I want to die,"" along with strong implications (e.g., ""Death is a mercy,"" ""contemplating suicide"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness, self-hatred (""I hate myself,"" ""burden,"" ""failure""), guilt, and isolation are prevalent.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Specific methods are detailed:  
     - Calculating lethal isopropyl alcohol dosage.  
     - Testing noose attachment points.  
     - Timing to jump in front of a car (later ruled out).  
     - Strategies to avoid family intervention.  
   - **Preparations/Actions**: Actively researched methods (""devised every possible way,"" ""calculated,"" ""tested,"" ""determined""), indicating concrete planning.

   - Explicit: ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""contemplating suicide.""  
   - Strong implied desire to die: ""I want to die,"" ""Death is a mercy.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""i shouldn't kill myself,"" ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade,"" and ""i'm not cut out for life"" explicitly express suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i can't even imagine mine being worth living"") and despair.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) are mentioned. References to calling loved ones (""goodbye"" implications) suggest *potential* preparatory behavior but lack actionable steps (e.g., ""I bought rope""). The timeline (""very soon"") implies intent but is vague.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on imminent future intent (""the day i chose is very soon"") and longstanding desire (""over a decade""). No past attempts are described.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses active suicidal desire (""kill myself,"" ""wanted to do this for over a decade"") and hopelessness, meeting **Ideation** criteria.  
   - It lacks specific plans/methods or descriptions of preparatory actions (e.g., ""I secured pills""). While calling loved ones *hints* at closure, it doesn't constitute a concrete step toward suicide (e.g., researching methods). Timeline urgency (""very soon"") leans toward **Ideation** without crossing into **Behavior**, as no method/immediate action is stated.  
   - Emotional distress is severe but secondary to explicit suicidal intent, ruling out **Indicator**. No past attempt is mentioned, excluding **Attempt**.

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. Mentions long-term pain (""been in pain for over 5 years""), hopelessness (""cba anymore""), and isolation (""Not going to contact anyone"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions taken are described. Isolation is noted but is not a concrete step toward suicide.
   - **Temporal Context**: Current/future intentions. The phrase ""most suicidal I've been in a couple months"" indicates present ideation. No references to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal"") and strongly implied (""want to be out of my misery""). **Yes** to both questions.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are present. Isolation is behavioral but not a suicide-specific action. **No** to all sub-questions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current** suicidal feelings (""most suicidal I've been..."") with no past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal desire (""suicidal,"" ""out of my misery""), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.

Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post states: ""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others."" This explicitly links the user’s intent to suicide (""kill only yourself"") while also threatening homicide. The phrase ""type of suicide"" confirms suicidal intent as part of their plan.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The user asks for ""suggestions of how to murder her,"" indicating concrete planning for a violent act tied to their suicidal ideation. The repeated declaration ""I will kill her"" signals imminent intent.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on **future intentions** (""I will kill her,"" ""how to murder her""). No past suicide attempts are described.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Anger, desperation, and fixation on retaliation are present, but these are secondary to the explicit suicidal/homicidal planning.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Excluded. The post explicitly references suicide and includes violent intent.
   - **Ideation**: Excluded. While suicidal thoughts are present (""type of suicide""), the user goes beyond passive ideation by detailing plans (murder method) and imminent intent.
   - **Behavior**: **Matches**. The post combines explicit suicidal intent (""suicide"" mentioned) with preparations (soliciting murder methods) and imminent intent (""I will kill her""). This aligns with the definition: suicidal thoughts + specific plans/preparations.
   - **Attempt**: Excluded. No past or current self-directed suicidal actions are described (e.g., ""I tried to..."").

I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct expressions like ""on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""end it all,"" indicating a strong desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I’m such a disappointment and failure""), despair (""I seriously cannot do this anymore""), and overwhelming stress (college-related).
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" implies a specific, concrete plan or method, though not detailed.
   - **Temporal Context**: Current/future intent (""I’m on the verge,"" ""might kill me before I even kill myself""). No mention of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") and strongly implied (""end it all"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A specific plan/method is implied (""I know exactly what to do""), signaling preparation.  
   - Imminent intent (""on the verge"") is evident.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intentions. No reference to past actions or attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal intent (""verge of suicide"") **and** implies a concrete plan (""know exactly what to do""), meeting the criteria for **Behavior**.  
   - It exceeds *Ideation* (thoughts without plans) due to implied preparation but does not describe a past *Attempt*.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrases ""Someone kill me"" and ""I just wanna die"" are direct expressions of wanting to die. **Yes** to explicit/strongly implied suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Despair is present (""I just wanna die""), but the explicit death wish dominates.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., buying tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") mentioned. **No**.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to current desires, not past actions or attempts. **No** indication of prior behavior.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""wanna die"") and solicitation of harm (""Someone kill me""), meeting the threshold for **suicidal ideation**.
   - It lacks specifics about plans, methods, or actions, ruling out *behavior* or *attempt*.  
   - General distress alone would fit *indicator*, but explicit suicidal intent elevates it to *ideation*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key Elements**: The post expresses profound distress, hopelessness, shame, loneliness, and a desperate plea to be ""normal."" It references lifelong struggles with sexuality (""male attracted to other males""), gender dysphoria, childhood trauma (""molested at 5""), depression, and rejection.  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - No direct or implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""end my life"").  
     - Desires focus on transformation (""make me straight,"" ""take all gayness away"") rather than ceasing to exist.  
     - **Conclusion**: No explicit/implied suicidal intent (No/No).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - Describes chronic struggles (""always had unhappy life"") and current despair but no references to past/planned suicidal actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe emotional distress (hopelessness, depression) but lacks **any** explicit or strongly implied suicidal ideation, plan, behavior, or past attempt.  
   - Falls under **Indicator** per the definition: *Vague distress without suicidal intent* (e.g., ""am tired of being unhappy"" aligns with ""life isn’t worth living"").  
   - Rules applied:  
     - Severe hopelessness alone is insufficient for higher categories without suicidal intent.  
     - Desires for change (""make me normal"") ≠ desire to die.

441,"Anyone suicidal from knee pain?. Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight.",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The word ""suicidal"" appears (""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?""), but it is framed as a general question, not a personal expression of intent. No first-person statements like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself."" Emotional distress is evident (frustration, hopelessness about chronic pain), but there is no direct or implied desire for self-harm from the author.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of specific suicide methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., tools, timing like ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Describes ongoing pain (8 months) with no reference to past/current suicidal actions or plans.
   - **Key Takeaway**: The post expresses distress and indirectly references suicide via a rhetorical question, but lacks personal suicidal intent, plans, or behaviors.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Fits best. The author discusses pain-induced hopelessness and uses ""suicidal"" hypothetically without applying it to themselves. No explicit/implied desire to die, no plans, and no actions taken. General distress without suicidal self-reference aligns with this category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - ""I'm over life"" implies strong hopelessness.  
     - ""One last record for me to make and it's finally over"" signals intent to end life after a final act.  
     - ""Looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"" explicitly desires death and frames it as relief.  
     - **Conclusion**: Yes (explicit desire to die).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - ""One last record... and it's finally over"" implies a specific, imminent plan (completing a record before ending life).  
     - No concrete method (e.g., pills) is stated, but the timeline (""finally over"") suggests preparation.  
     - **Conclusion**: Strong intent with imminent timing.  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - All statements reflect current/future intent (e.g., ""it's finally over"").  
     - References to a loved one’s suicide are contextual, not a personal past attempt.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal intent is explicit and strong (beyond vague distress).  
   - The post includes imminent intent (""finally over"") tied to a concrete step (completing a record), indicating **behavior** (preparation + timing).  
   - Falls under ""Behavior"" per definition: *Strong intent with imminent timing even without a method*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Anger, resentment, and emotional pain are present (e.g., ""I want to make my mom feel pain,"" ""She belittles me"").

   - **References to Past Attempts**: None present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""I want to die""), confirming active suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The post focuses on current/future desires (""I want to die"") with no mention of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

   - Absence of specific plans, methods, or actions rules out **Behavior** and **Attempt**.  
   - The core content aligns with **Ideation**: explicit suicidal thoughts without plans or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I've started to try and starve myself,"" ""I'll at least be dead by the end of the week,"" and ""I just want my death to come faster"" strongly imply a desire to die. Direct comparisons to lethal methods (hanging, gun) reinforce suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""I'm truly useless""), worthlessness (""I can't do anything right""), and isolation (""All the help I could get doesn’t even want to talk to me"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are detailed (starving, hanging, gun), with active steps taken (""I've started to try and starve myself""). Imminent intent is clear (""dead by the end of the week"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Current actions (ongoing self-starvation) and future intent (death by week's end) dominate. No clear references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit/implied desire to die: **Yes** (""I just want my death to come faster"").  
   - Severe distress with implied intent: **Yes** (supports ideation/behavior).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I plan my suicide every single day"" explicitly reference suicide. Additional expressions (""I just don’t want to go on anymore"") strongly imply a desire to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""My life has already been over""), despair (""bottomless pit inside""), rage, and isolation are present.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are detailed: ""using a pistol or an escape bag"" and ""douse myself in gasoline and light up.""  
   - **Preparations/Actions**: Planning occurs daily, but no concrete actions (e.g., acquiring tools) are described.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on **current/future** intentions (""I plan my suicide every single day""). No past attempts mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""plan my suicide"") and strongly implied (""don’t want to go on anymore""). **Yes**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I've been suicidale all my life,"" ""I just can’t pull myself together and just do it,"" and descriptions of past attempts (e.g., cutting wrists, jumping in front of a train) directly reference suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I can’t go on like this""), isolation (""I have nobody""), and trauma (rape, abuse).
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The post describes a recent concrete action: ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck."" This shows preparation and initiation of a suicide method (hanging). The phrase ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"" implies intent, though the action was interrupted.
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to both past attempts (cutting wrists at 11, lying on a road at 19, jumping in front of a train at 24) and a recent event (standing on a chair with a rope ""today""). The latter is a current behavior, not just ideation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidale,"" past attempts) and strongly implied (""do it""). Severe distress with clear intent is present.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods are named (rope, cutting wrists, jumping in front of a train). Recent preparation/action is confirmed: standing on a chair with a rope is an initiated behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past attempts are extensively described. The rope incident is a recent, self-interrupted action (""Today I failed"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds *Ideation* due to specific methods and actions.  
   - It qualifies for *Behavior* (current preparation: rope incident) but **also describes past attempts**.  
   - **Key Rule**: ""If the post describes a past suicide attempt [...] classify as 'attempt'."" The rope incident is a recent self-interrupted action (""I failed""), fitting the *Attempt* definition: ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions."" The mention of current ideation does not override this, as the attempt is clear and explicit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""kill myself""). Phrases like ""if I die then I die"" and accepting death at ""50 or earlier"" reflect passive resignation or fatalism, not active desire for death. The user explicitly states, ""I don’t have any plans to end it,"" weakening any implication of intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""future is really grim"") and despair (""not worth pushing my life further"") are present, but these alone do not imply suicidal intent.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. Stopping doctor visits suggests self-neglect but is not a suicide-specific action.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current/future acceptance of death (""when my time has come""), with no references to past attempts or actions.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post lacks explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent. While it expresses severe hopelessness and fatalistic acceptance of death, these align with the **Indicator** category (general distress without clear desire to die). The absence of plans, methods, or actions rules out **Ideation**, **Behavior**, or **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""kill myself"" is explicitly stated, indicating a direct expression of suicidal thoughts.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong self-hatred (""I just fucking hate myself""), hopelessness (references to depression, social isolation, and physical health struggles), and worthlessness (""too ugly,"" ""too lazy"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific suicide method, preparation, or imminent intent is described. The mention of ""starve myself"" is contextualized as a weight-loss struggle, not a suicidal plan. The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" explicitly denies action.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes current feelings and passive suicidal thoughts, with no reference to past attempts or actions. The cowardice remark implies inaction rather than a past event.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"").  
   - Expressions of wanting to die are implied through self-loathing and hopelessness but are countered by the admission of inaction (""too cowardly"").  
   - **Conclusion**: Suicidal intent is present but passive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned.  
   - ""Starve myself"" is tied to weight loss, not suicide.  
   - No imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.  
   - **Conclusion**: Lacks concrete plans or actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current emotional state, not past events.  
   - No description of attempts (completed or interrupted).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** due to explicit suicidal language (""kill myself"").  
   - It fits **Ideation** because:  
     - Suicidal thoughts are explicit and strong (""kill myself"").  
     - No plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent are present.  
     - Self-described cowardice reinforces inaction, aligning with passive ideation.

   - The post lacks any personal suicidal intent, plans, behaviors, or past attempts. It focuses on advising others and mentions suicide only contextually. General distress or vague references to suicide (e.g., ""thinking about suicide"" as a topic) without the author’s personal desire to die aligns with **Indicator**.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct statements: ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""I am finally becoming content with that,"" and ""will only drive me further to killing myself."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (e.g., ""no reason to live,"" ""waste of life""), hopelessness (""nature is just telling me it’s time to die""), isolation, and shame.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. The user fears psychiatric commitment but describes no concrete actions toward suicide.  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: None. The post focuses on current ideation and emotional pain.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct language (""suicide,"" ""killing myself"") and acceptance of suicide as a solution (""content with that"") confirm active suicidal ideation.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. Despite distress, no plans, methods, imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""), or preparatory actions are described. Stopping medication/drinking are risk factors but not suicide-specific behaviors.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to **current/future** intentions (e.g., ""I feel like I am finally becoming content with [suicide]""). No past attempts are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post meets **Ideation** criteria:  
     - Explicit suicidal desire (""killing myself,"" ""suicide is their life’s purpose"").  
     - Absence of plans, methods, or actions (ruling out *Behavior*).  
     - No description of past suicide attempts (ruling out *Attempt*).  
     - While severe hopelessness is present, explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond *Indicator*.

451,"Is drowning yourself painful?. As the title says. I think its the best option for me, its basically a guaranteed death is it not?

If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that.",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post directly references self-harm via drowning (""drowning yourself""), explicitly questions the method's pain level, and states it's ""the best option"" for a ""guaranteed death."" The phrase ""I think I might go and do that"" strongly implies intent to end life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness is evident (e.g., framing drowning as a ""peaceful"" escape), but suicidal intent is explicit.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method (drowning) is named, described in detail (""slowly sinking to the bottom""), and tied to a potential trigger (""If I get kicked out of my house""). The phrasing ""I think I might go and do that"" signals preparation and conditional intent.  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. The post discusses future intent only.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is strongly implied (""drowning yourself,"" ""guaranteed death""), and desire to die is explicit (""best option for me""). **Yes/Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (drowning) is mentioned, with rationale (""peaceful,"" ""guaranteed death""). Conditional preparation is indicated (""If I get kicked out... I might go and do that""). **Yes**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers strictly to future intentions (""I might go and do that""), not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post goes beyond vague distress (indicator) or general suicidal thoughts (ideation) by detailing a method and conditional preparations. It does not describe a past/current action (attempt). The specificity of the method + contingent intent aligns with **Behavior**.

I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate?

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit suicide mentions**: The post includes direct phrases: ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts."" These are explicit references to suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional indicators**: The tone is partially hopeful (due to Star Wars providing a reason to live) but acknowledges ongoing suicidal thoughts (""postpone any suicide attempts"").
   - **Plan or method identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., buying tools, writing notes) are mentioned. The reference to ""postponing"" attempts is vague and future-oriented (""next decade"").
   - **Temporal context**: The suicidal intent is framed as a current/future possibility (""postpone [...] for the next decade""), not a past event. No description of prior attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"" are explicit.  
   - **Yes**: Desire not to be alive is implied but countered by a delaying factor (Star Wars releases).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains a direct statement: ""I'm going to kill myself."" This is an explicit declaration of suicidal intent. Additional phrases like ""I have no value"" and intense self-loathing (""I’m the worst of all human beings"") reinforce severe despair but are secondary to the explicit threat.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong expressions of hopelessness, shame, worthlessness, and self-degradation (e.g., ""useless bitch,"" ""I have no value"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or actions are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or steps like ""I bought pills""). The statement lacks imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete plans.
   - **Temporal Context**: The suicidal intent (""I’m going to kill myself"") is expressed as a current/future intention. No references to past attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself""), moving beyond vague distress.  
   - Expressions of wanting to die are direct and unambiguous.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing noted. The absence of these elements rules out ""behavior.""

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post meets the **Ideation** definition: explicit suicidal intent (""I’m going to kill myself"") without evidence of plans, methods, preparations, or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me"" are explicit expressions of wanting to die or end life. Emotional context (e.g., ""endless misery,"" ""back to feeling like shit"") reinforces severe distress tied to suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) are mentioned. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key Elements**: The post describes extreme distress, paranoia (""everyone is in on it but me""), sleep deprivation, financial strain, and a recent MS diagnosis. Phrases like ""I’m so tired,"" ""My heads messing with me,"" and ""I cant take this torture"" convey hopelessness and despair. However, there are **no explicit mentions** of death, suicide, self-harm, or implied desires to end life (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). References to a ""dead body smell"" relate to an external event (landlord’s false report), not the user’s intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness, exhaustion, and persecution themes are present, but they lack a direct link to suicidal intent.
   - **Plans/Methods/Preparations**: None identified. No methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or actions taken toward self-harm are mentioned.
   - **Past Attempts**: No references to prior suicide attempts or self-interrupted actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide explicitly mentioned? **No** (terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" absent).
   - Expressions of wanting to die/not be alive? **No** (phrases like ""I want to leave"" refer to escaping circumstances, not life).
   - **Conclusion**: Emotional distress is severe but lacks implied suicidal intent. Remains in lower-risk category.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific methods mentioned? **No**.
   - Preparations/actions described? **No**.
   - Imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"")? **No**.
   - **Conclusion**: No evidence elevates this beyond general distress.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - All content describes **current/future** suffering (e.g., ""I’m gonna be wakened if I fall asleep""). No past suicide attempts referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Fits **Indicator**: The post expresses severe distress, helplessness (""I don’t know what options I have left""), and vague suffering (""this is hell"") but lacks explicit/implied suicidal desire, plans, or actions. Suicidal intent is not present, per the definition.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""Possible suicide date is in July"" explicitly references suicide planning. ""I'm fucking debating it"" strongly implies active consideration of suicide.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (e.g., ""I have nobody,"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" hopelessness about identity/clinging to ""hope"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: A specific timeline (""in July"") is stated, indicating preparation and intent. No method is mentioned, but the date implies concrete planning.
   - **Past Attempts/Behavior**: No references to past actions or attempts. Focus is on future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide date"") and strongly implied (""debating it""). Expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""I cling onto 'hope'"" in context of suicidal debate).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A specific timeframe (""in July"") signals preparation and imminent intent, elevating it beyond passive ideation. No method is detailed, but the date alone suggests behavioral planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""in July""), not past events. No history of attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** (explicit suicidal intent rules this out).  
   - It surpasses **Ideation** due to the specific future date (""July""), indicating preparatory intent (a behavioral element).  
   - **Behavior** fits best: Explicit suicidal intent + concrete planning (timeline) without describing a past attempt.

   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or actions are mentioned. The user explicitly rules out acting due to religious beliefs (""I probably never kill myself"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to recurring thoughts (""whenever I see happy people"") and future hopelessness. No past attempts or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") are described.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post contains **explicit suicidal ideation** (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself"") but lacks any plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent. The religious barrier (""big sin"") further negates behavioral elements.
   - **Indicator** is ruled out due to explicit suicidal language.
   - **Behavior** and **Attempt** are excluded because there are no concrete plans, actions, or references to past attempts.
   - **Ideation** fits best: Strong expressions of suicidal desire without actionable steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct expressions of suicidal intent: ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" and references to suicide notes.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I'm so tired of failing everyone""), despair (""I can't fucking do another year""), and isolation (""No one from my real life"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: A specific timeline is given (""on new year's eve""), and **preparations are confirmed** (""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year""). The phrase ""this is the one"" implies imminent intent.
   - **Temporal Context**: References past preparations (notes) and declares a future intent (""ending it all on new year's eve""). No description of a past *attempt* (notes are preparatory, not actions taken).

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit suicidal intent (""ending it all"") and imminent timeline (""new year's eve"") go beyond passive ideation.
   - Preparatory actions (creating multiple suicide notes) align with the **Behavior** category, defined as suicidal thoughts plus ""preparations or actions taken"" or ""strong intent with imminent timing.""  
   - Past suicide notes indicate concrete steps toward an attempt, but no *actual* attempt is described (e.g., no action like self-harm). Thus, **Attempt** does not apply.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post does not explicitly mention suicide (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself""). However, it describes **self-harm** (""tried to cut myself"")—a behavior strongly associated with suicidal intent.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Mentions distress (""breakdown,"" ""very bad night"") but no explicit hopelessness or desire to die.  
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: **Specific action taken** (""tried to cut myself"") is disclosed. The method (cutting) is identified, and timing (""last night"") confirms recency.  
   - **Past Attempts/Behavior**: Explicitly references a **past self-harm incident** (""last night"") with physical action taken (""tried"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS?**:  
   - No explicit terms, but **self-harm is a suicidal behavior**. Strongly implied due to context (""wanted to feel something real"" during breakdown).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFIED?**:  
   - **Yes** (""cut myself""). Action was attempted (""tried"") and occurred recently.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to a **past event** (""last night"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No—vague distress alone would fit, but concrete self-harm action moves beyond this.  
   - **Ideation?** No—ideation requires thoughts without action. Here, **action was taken**.  
   - **Behavior?** Partially—suicidal behavior includes actions, but **""attempt"" supersedes if a past act occurred**.  
   - **Attempt?** **Yes**—the post describes a **past self-harm action with clear intent** (""tried to cut myself""). The act was initiated (even if stopped), meeting the ""attempt"" definition.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""plan to kill myself"" is a direct and explicit expression of suicidal intent. The rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I?"" reinforces active consideration.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""I have nothing and no one""), hopelessness (""no purpose to live""), and shame (""I became toxic"") are present but secondary to the explicit suicidal statement.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: The word ""plan"" implies intent but lacks specifics (e.g., method, timing, preparations). No concrete actions (e.g., acquiring tools) are described.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on current/future intent (""plan to kill myself""), not past actions. No mention of prior attempts.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"").
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no description of past or initiated actions.

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness is evident (""Nobodyll do shit""), indicating perceived isolation and futility of intervention.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned. The focus is on whether to announce the act, not on tools, locations, or preparations.
   - **Temporal Context**: Future intent (""will be killing yourself soon"") is stated, but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""killing yourself"").  
   - Strong expressions of wanting to die (""Nobodyll do shit... no worries of being stopped"").  
   → **Result**: Strongly implies intent (Yes/Yes).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") described.  
   → **Result**: Absence of actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to future intentions (""will be""), not past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal intent but lacks specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions.  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Strong desire to die without concrete steps (e.g., debating announcement ≠ planning method).  
   - *Not Behavior*: No plan/action; *Not Attempt*: No past/current attempt described; *Not Indicator*: Explicit suicidal intent elevates beyond vague distress.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains multiple direct statements: ""I think I'll kill myself tonight,"" ""I want to kill myself so bad."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. A specific method (""hang myself"") and location (""at the woods"") are mentioned. Preparations are implied (""play my favorite music""). Imminent timing (""tonight"") is also stated.
   - **Temporal Context**: The post describes future intent (""tonight"") with no reference to past events or attempts.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong despair (""I’m so fucking tired of everything"") reinforces suicidal intent but is secondary to explicit plans.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds *Indicator* (no explicit intent) and *Ideation* (thoughts without plans/actions). It includes a specific method (hanging), preparations (music), and imminent timing (""tonight""), aligning with **Behavior**.  
   - *Attempt* is ruled out as no past/initiated action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""I want to kill myself"" is a direct, explicit statement of suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: The user mentions having ""set a date 2 weeks ago"" and states they are ""approaching"" it. Additionally, they describe preparatory actions: ""Already started to cancel friendships.""  
   - **Temporal Context**: The date was set in the past (""2 weeks ago""), but the intent is current/future-focused (""I'm approaching""). No past attempt is described.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""truly alone forever""), loneliness, and frustration (""What a joke"") are present but secondary to explicit suicidal intent and planning.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent (""I want to kill myself"").  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit suicidal thoughts exist, but the post goes beyond passive ideation by detailing a set timeline and preparations.  
   - **Behavior**: The combination of explicit suicidal intent (""I want to kill myself""), a specific timeline (""set a date""), and preparatory actions (""cancel friendships"") fits this category. No method is named, but imminent intent + actions qualify.  
   - **Attempt**: Ruled out—no description of a past or ongoing suicidal *action*.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself,"" ""suicide""), confirming active suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent are indicated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""I want to die"" appears twice, explicitly expressing a desire to die. No vague implications—intent is direct.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., gathering tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The phrase ""too much of a coward to do it"" explicitly states inaction.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current feelings (""want to die""), with no reference to past attempts or actions.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness and self-criticism (""coward"") are present but secondary to explicit suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is **strongly implied** (""I want to die"") → **Yes**.  
   - Direct expression of wanting to die → **Yes**.  
   - Emotional context (shame, hopelessness) supports suicidal intent → Leans toward *ideation*.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent → **No**.  
   - Self-described inaction (""too much of a coward to do it"") rules out *behavior*.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - No past attempts described → **No**.  
   - Focus on current desire only → Not *attempt*.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Rejected—explicit desire to die exceeds vague distress.  
   - **Ideation**: Fits—explicit suicidal desire (""I want to die"") without plans/actions.  
   - **Behavior**: Rejected—no methods, preparations, or imminent intent.  
   - **Attempt**: Rejected—no description of past/current actions.

   - Preparations/actions: Imminent intent (""I'm gonna wait it off,"" ""gonna try here"").  
   - Temporal context: Future intent (""gonna""), no past attempts referenced.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes: ""commit suicide"" is explicit.  
   - Yes: ""die of blood loss"" implies a desire to end life.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes **explicit suicidal intent** (""commit suicide"") and a **specific method** (""twist my dick off"").  
   - The language (""gonna,"" ""here"") implies **imminent action**, fitting the **Behavior** category (suicidal thoughts + specific plan/method + imminent intent).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The post includes strong implications of wanting to end life (e.g., ""Sayonara"" as a farewell, ""I have no reason to live""). While suicide is not explicitly named, the language conveys a desire to escape suffering through death. Emotional indicators like despair (""endured physical pain and mental depression for years""), hopelessness (""no reason to live""), and loneliness are prominent.  
     - *Explicit/Implied Suicide*: **Yes** (strongly implied desire to die).  
     - *Direct/Implied Expressions of Wanting to Die*: **Yes** (""I will eventually die in a much painful way"" and ""no reason to live"" imply acceptance/wish for death).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., gathering tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on current/future suffering (""My disease are getting worse,"" ""I will eventually die""), with no references to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a **strongly implied desire to die** due to unbearable suffering, aligning with suicidal ideation (e.g., ""no reason to live"" suggests passive suicidal thoughts).  
   - It lacks concrete plans, methods, or actions, ruling out *Behavior* or *Attempt*. While severe hopelessness is present, the implied intent to escape pain elevates it beyond *Indicator*.  
   - **Best Fit**: **Ideation** (implied suicidal thoughts without plans/actions).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct references (""committing suicide successfully"") and explicit statements of suicidal ideation (""I'll still be suicidal lol""). It also expresses envy of others' deaths and a desire to die (""Why can't that be me?"").

   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. No imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.
   - **References to Past Attempts**: None. The post discusses thoughts and envy but no actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. Suicide is explicitly referenced (""committing suicide,"" ""suicidal""), and there are strong implied desires to die (e.g., envy of others' deaths, ""Why can’t that be me?"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains a direct expression: *""Am I the only one who wants to die...""*. This is an explicit statement of desire to die, reinforced by the context of questioning why fear of hell is ""one of the only things keeping me alive.""
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (e.g., *""I’ve done some bad shit,"" ""feeling really isolated""*) and shame (*""sorry to talk about this,"" ""seems like I’m whining""*) are present but secondary to the explicit suicidal intent.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The focus is on internal conflict (fear of hell) rather than actionable steps.
   - **Past Attempts or Actions**: No references to past suicide attempts, self-harm actions, or interrupted plans.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Explicit/Implied Desire to Die**: Yes. *""Wants to die""* is unambiguous. The phrase *""keeping me alive""* further implies suicidal intent is actively present but restrained by fear.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Methods/Preparations/Imminence**: None. Religious fear is discussed as a deterrent, but no concrete plans or actions are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Current Intent**: The post describes ongoing suicidal thoughts (*""wants to die,"" ""keeping me alive""*) without referencing past attempts or future plans.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit statement *""wants to die""* confirms **suicidal ideation**.  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts move this beyond ideation. The religious conflict contextualizes the ideation but does not constitute a plan or behavior.  
   - **Ruling out other categories**:  
     - *Indicator*: Excluded due to explicit desire to die.  
     - *Behavior*: No plans/preparations.  
     - *Attempt*: No past actions described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post explicitly states: ""I thought of killing myself multiple times."" This is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I don't know how long I can cope""), isolation (loss of support after coming out), and distress are present, but these contextualize the explicit suicidal ideation.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific methods, preparations, or imminent actions (e.g., tools, locations, timing like ""tonight"") are mentioned. The thoughts remain abstract.
   - **Temporal Context**: Suicidal thoughts are explicitly framed in the past (""I thought of killing myself multiple times""). Current language expresses distress but lacks references to active plans, preparations, or recent attempts.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit statement ""I thought of killing myself"" confirms **suicidal intent**, ruling out *Indicator*.
   - No evidence of plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., ""I have pills"" or ""doing it tonight"") exists, ruling out *Behavior*.
   - No description of past actions taken to end life (e.g., ""I tried to..."") is present, ruling out *Attempt*.

   - It includes a request for methods (""Where can I find out how to die"") but does **not** specify a plan, tool, location, or preparatory action.  
   - Emotional context shows desperation (""I don’t care if it’s slow or painful""), but no past attempts or actions are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. ""Definitely die"" is a strong implied expression of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method or preparation**. The post asks *where* to find methods but does not state a chosen method, plan, or imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **future intent** (""want to"") with no reference to past attempts or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""familiar will to die,"" ""if I do it,"" and ""if I attempt again"" strongly imply suicidal intent. The writer explicitly references a past attempt (""if I attempt again"") and expresses persistent desire to die (""not because I want to be alive"").
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I don’t see a future,"" ""I’m tired of fighting""), dissociation (PTSD reference), and emotional exhaustion are present.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or immediate preparation is mentioned. The writer states intent is ""months out"" and emphasizes they are ""not in immediate danger."" References to ""plans"" are social commitments (buying time), not suicide methods.
   - **Temporal Context**: Past attempt is confirmed (""if I attempt again""). Current statements focus on future intent (""if I do it, it’ll be at least a few months out""), not imminent actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   Yes. Suicidal intent is strongly implied through ""will to die"" and direct references to past/future attempts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   No. No specific method, tools, or imminent actions are described. Future intent lacks concreteness or immediacy.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   Past attempt is acknowledged, but the post primarily centers on current/future suicidal thoughts (""if I do it"") without active steps.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post confirms **past suicidal behavior** (""attempt again""), which would typically suggest the *Attempt* category.  
   - However, the writer explicitly states they are ""not in immediate danger"" and delays intent to ""months out"" with no active planning. Current expressions (""will to die,"" ""if I do it"") align with **ongoing suicidal ideation** without actionable steps.  
   - Per the rules: *Attempt* requires a **past concrete action** (which is mentioned), but the category definition prioritizes current state when past attempts are referenced alongside active ideation. Here, the absence of imminent plans/preparations and the focus on persistent thoughts (""familiar will to die"") outweigh the past attempt reference.  
   - **Result**: Falls under *Ideation* due to dominant expressions of desire to die + lack of current plans/actions.

   - **Emotional Indicators**: Severe hopelessness (""I've fucked everything up""), despair (""I can't see myself going on""), and fixation on death as relief (""peaceful to think about... free from everything"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods (gun, kitchen knife) are mentioned, along with a timeline (""480 days"") and imminent temptation (""Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on future intentions (""I need to wait another 480 days"") and current urges (""I can't wait anymore""). No reference to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicidal intent is explicit (""take my life"") and strongly implied (""I want the pain to stop"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""I don't want any more chances"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods: ""gun to the head"" and ""kitchen knife"" are explicitly named.  
   - Preparation/Imminence: Detailed timeline (""480 days"") and immediate temptation to act (""grab a kitchen knife and do it there"") indicate preparatory intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

It just feels like everyone in my life is focused on their career goals and I can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" but only in the context of asking others about their experiences (""Did anyone having thoughts of suicide benefit...?"").  
   - The author explicitly states: ""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live,"" indicating a desire to survive and seek solutions.  
   - Emotional indicators include distress over perceived failures (""all I failed to do"") and difficulty concentrating, but no explicit expressions of wanting to die.  
   - **No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts** are mentioned. Focus is on seeking help (inpatient care/medication) and coping.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**. Suicide is referenced indirectly in a general question (""thoughts of suicide""), but the author’s own statements lack explicit/strongly implied suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die""). Instead, they emphasize efforts to ""live.""  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No methods, preparations, imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight""), or actions are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Discusses general struggles and future-oriented steps (""figure out what steps to take""). **No past attempts** or time-bound risks mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows distress, hopelessness, and isolation but lacks explicit/implied suicidal desire, plans, or behaviors. The author’s focus on seeking help and affirming a will to live aligns with **Indicator** (general distress without suicidal intent).

I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge. Can't sleep. No future.,2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post directly states ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday,"" which is an explicit expression of suicidal intent. Phrases like ""No future"" strongly imply a desire to end life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Yes. The post describes hopelessness (""Everyday is the same,"" ""No future""), isolation (""lying in bed while bf plays video games""), and despair (""unemployed,"" ""graying hair,"" ""Can't sleep"").  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: Yes. The post specifies a method (""Bridge"") and a timeline (""on Monday""), indicating concrete planning.  
   - **References to Past Attempts**: No. The post does not mention any prior suicide attempts or actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself""), and intent is clear.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A specific method (""Bridge"") and imminent timing (""on Monday"") are provided, signaling preparation and intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The suicidal intent is future-oriented (""on Monday""). No past attempts are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post goes beyond passive thoughts (which would be *Ideation*) by including a specific plan (method: ""Bridge"") and timeframe (""Monday""). This aligns with the **Behavior** category, defined as suicidal thoughts combined with a plan, method, or imminent intent. It does not describe a past action (which would be *Attempt*), and the explicit plan rules out *Indicator* or *Ideation*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**:  
     - ""kms"" (kill myself) is explicitly mentioned.  
     - ""when I do it"" implies intent to act.  
     - **Conclusion**: Strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent (Yes).  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**:  
     - ""Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose"" indicates a specific method (suicide by hanging).  
     - ""Overcame a big hurdle to kms"" and ensuring the mother’s welfare (""my mom won’t be on the street"") imply preparation.  
     - **Conclusion**: Specific method + preparation signs present (Yes).  
   - **Temporal Context**:  
     - ""Recently overcame a big hurdle"" and ""when I do it"" point to current/future intent, not past actions.  
     - No description of a past attempt.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes **explicit suicidal intent** (""kms"") and **specific preparations** (noose wallpaper, logistical planning for mother’s welfare).  
   - This aligns with **Behavior**, defined as suicidal thoughts combined with a plan, preparation, or imminent intent.  
   - Rules:  
     - No past attempt described → Not ""Attempt"".  
     - Explicit intent + method → Beyond ""Ideation"" or ""Indicator"".

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct expressions of suicidal intent: ""I want to die"" and ""i’ve seen enough of my future to want to continue.""  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I feel like I wasn’t supposed to be born,"" ""adulthood is all downhill""), despair (""I haven’t been happy in 2 years""), and self-loathing (""I’m a failure"").  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on **current** distress and future dread (""I feel like i’ve seen enough of my future""). No reference to past attempts or actions taken.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. ""I want to die"" is an explicit declaration of suicidal desire. The conflicting statement (""I don’t want to die but I don’t want to be me anymore"") does not negate the explicit initial expression.  
   - **Yes**. Strong implied desire to end existence (""I feel like I wasn’t supposed to be born"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. Absence of methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes ongoing suffering but **no past attempts** or actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal intent** (""I want to die"") and profound hopelessness but lacks any plan, method, or preparatory action. This aligns with **Ideation**, which covers explicit desires to die without concrete steps. The later conflicting statement does not override the direct suicidal expression.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post contains direct references to suicide (""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die,"" ""this method is surefire"") and describes intense emotional distress (loneliness, numbness, despair).
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are detailed (aspirin overdose, firearm use, hanging, exit bag). Preparations are explicit (purchasing tools, researching, setting up the exit bag). Imminent action is described (""When I turned that gas valve"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to **past attempts** (aspirin overdose at 15, firearm incident at 21, hanging attempt recently) and **current actions** (preparing/initiating the exit bag method today, aborting mid-process).

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Excluded. Suicidal intent is explicit, with detailed methods and actions.
   - **Ideation**: Excluded. Beyond passive thoughts; includes concrete plans and initiated actions.
   - **Behavior**: Partially fits (current exit bag preparation), but overshadowed by descriptions of **past attempts** and the **aborted current action**.
   - **Attempt**: **Fits best**. The post describes:
     - A **past suicide attempt** (aspirin overdose leading to hospitalization).
     - **Incomplete/interrupted attempts** (firearm malfunction, hanging causing physical harm).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""should just end my life"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent. ""End my life"" is a clear synonym for suicide.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly states a desire to die (""end my life"") with strong emotional distress but lacks concrete plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions.  
   - **Indicator** is ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Behavior** is not applicable: no plans, methods, or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"") are described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: The phrase ""I'm about to kill myself"" is an explicit declaration of suicidal intent. ""I don't see a reason to live"" reinforces a desire to end life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""Life sucks"") and despair are present but secondary to explicit intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools) is mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: ""I'm about to"" implies imminent intent (current/future), not past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct statement (""kill myself"") and implied desire to die (""no reason to live"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method**, but imminent intent (""about to"") is strongly implied.  
   - **Rule application**: Imminent timing (""about to"") without a method still triggers 'behavior' (per guidelines).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Current/future intent (""about to""), no past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent + imminent timing (""about to"") aligns with **Behavior**, as the post bridges ideation and impending action without detailing methods/preparations.

   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No specific method, timing (e.g., ""maybe in my 20's or 30's"" is vague), or preparations (e.g., no tools/actions).  
   - **Past Attempts**: None mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Future intent (""I want to experience a few more things before I do""), not imminent or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""contemplated suicide""). Strong desire to die is clear (""I know I am going to do it""). → **Yes**.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post explicitly mentions a method (""duloxetine pills"") and indicates possession of the means (""I have a few pills"").
   - The phrase ""saving for later"" implies preparation for future use, suggesting intent.
   - There is a strong implication of suicidal intent through the question ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" coupled with saving pills. This goes beyond vague distress.
   - No emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness) or past attempts are described. The focus is on method and preparation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - **Yes**: The query about whether duloxetine can cause death, combined with saving pills, strongly implies suicidal intent (e.g., considering overdose as a method).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **Yes**: A specific method (pills) is named, and preparatory action is confirmed (""saving for later""). This demonstrates concrete steps beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post discusses current/future intentions (""saving for later""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** (no explicit intent) due to implied suicidal intent and method focus.
   - It surpasses **Ideation** (thoughts without plans/actions) because a method is specified and preparatory action (saving pills) is taken.
   - It does not qualify as **Attempt** since no past or ongoing suicidal action is described.
   - **Behavior** fits: The combination of a named method (pills) and tangible preparation (possessing/saving them) aligns with the definition.

Crucially, it includes a **strongly implied expression of suicidal intent**: ""I just want to end but haven’t yet."" The phrase ""want to end"" clearly implies a desire to cease living, though it avoids explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""die.""
   - **Explicit suicide mentions**: **Yes** (strongly implied via ""I just want to end,"" indicating a desire to end life).  
   - **Plan or method identification**: **No** specific methods, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The phrase ""haven’t yet"" confirms no action was taken.  
   - **Temporal context**: Focuses on **current/future intentions** (""I just want to end"") without references to past attempts or events.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** (vague distress without suicidal intent) due to the clear implied desire to die (""want to end"").  
   - It lacks elements of **Behavior** (no plans, methods, or actions) or **Attempt** (no description of past actions).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" and ""I cant off myself"" explicitly express a desire to die.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness and fatigue are noted, but these support the explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: A specific method (""buy the gas"") is mentioned, but there is **no evidence of preparation or action taken** (e.g., ""I never leave the house to go buy the gas"" implies inaction).  
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to current/future intent (""by the end of the day today"") but lacks immediacy or confirmation of steps taken. No past attempts are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent? **Yes** (""dead by the end of the day,"" ""off myself"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method mentioned? **Yes** (gas).  
   - Preparations/actions taken? **No** (procrastination and fatigue prevent action).  
   - Imminent intent? **No** (stated possibility is hypothetical: ""If I just put my mind to it,"" but fatigue delays action).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Current/future intent? **Yes** (hypothetical near-future: ""by the end of the day"").  
   - Past attempts? **No**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal intent is explicit (supports moving beyond *Indicator*).  
   - A method is mentioned, but **no preparations or actions** are taken (e.g., not leaving the house). Procrastination/fatigue are barriers, showing thoughts without concrete steps.  
   - This aligns with **Ideation**: Strong desire to die with a method referenced, but no evidence of initiation, preparation, or imminent execution.

   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to act on suicidal thoughts (""do it"") with urgency (""already""), indicating **strong intent**.  
   - Lack of a concrete method or preparation leans away from full 'behavior,' but the imminent intent (""do it already"") pushes it beyond passive 'ideation' per the rules.  
   - **Classification**: **Behavior** (suicidal intent + imminent timing, even without a method).

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. Phrases like ""I planned to kill myself in the forest"" and ""I plan to hang myself"" directly state suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Mentions numbness (""I'm not sad or depress"") and persistent detachment (""weird feeling didn’t change""), but these are secondary to explicit suicidal statements.
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. Specific methods are detailed: ""hang myself in the highest tree"" and ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" Preparations are confirmed: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car.""
   - **Temporal Context**: Refers to a past plan (""planned to kill myself in January"") but emphasizes *current* intent (""I plan to hang myself... Everything is ready"").

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds **Ideation** (suicidal thoughts without plans) due to explicit methods and preparations.
   - It describes actionable steps (gathering tools, specifying a location) but no *past* attempt. The January plan was not acted upon (""I didn’t"").
   - Fits **Behavior**: Concrete plans + preparations + imminent risk (""time to stop the lie and end it"").

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Mentions of death/dying/suicide**: The post questions life's purpose (""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"") and expresses existential despair (""there still is no point for us being here""). However, it explicitly states, ""I don’t really want to die,"" directly negating active suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""life isn’t worth living"" equivalent) and worthlessness (""I wish I was never born"") are present, but these are framed as philosophical distress rather than actionable desire.
   - **Plan/method/preparation**: No references to specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., gathering tools), or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Past attempts**: No mention of prior suicide attempts or self-harm actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no use of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - While phrases like ""wish I was never born"" imply passive despair, the explicit denial (""don’t really want to die"") counters strong suicidal intent.  
   - **Conclusion**: No (lacks explicit/strongly implied desire to die).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent timing discussed.  
   - **Conclusion**: Absent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - Focuses on general existential angst (""being here,"" ""point of living"") without past actions or future plans.  
   - **Conclusion**: Present-focused distress only.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses hopelessness and passive despair but lacks explicit/implied suicidal intent due to the direct rejection of wanting to die.  
   - Philosophical questioning about life’s purpose aligns with **Indicator** (general distress without suicidal intent).  
   - Does not meet thresholds for **Ideation** (no desire to die), **Behavior** (no plan/action), or **Attempt** (no past actions).

493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No direct or implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end it all"").  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Shame, anxiety, and fear of social judgment are present, but no expressions of hopelessness, despair, or loneliness tied to suicidal intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on past actions (buying the item) and future worries (starting school), with no references to past/current suicidal actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes distress and shame over a specific incident but lacks **explicit/implied suicidal intent** required for ""ideation,"" ""behavior,"" or ""attempt.""  
   - Emotional distress alone (e.g., feeling ""disgusting"") without suicidal cues fits the **indicator** category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit mention: ""kill yourself"" directly references suicide.
   - Emotional context: Anger, resentment, and perceived injustice (""why do you want me to suffer"") imply a desire to escape suffering.
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or imminent timing (e.g., no tools, locations, or ""tonight"").
   - No references to past actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""kill yourself"" is an explicit suicide reference.  
   - **Yes**: ""why do you want me to suffer"" strongly implies a desire to end life to escape pain.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No methods**: No pills, weapons, or locations mentioned.  
   - **No preparations/actions**: No notes, gathered tools, or partial attempts.  
   - **No imminent intent**: No time-bound language (e.g., ""now,"" ""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current feelings, not past events. No mention of prior attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal intent (""kill yourself"") and a desire to end suffering.  
   - Lacks plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timing required for **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past actions, ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - Strong suicidal intent moves it beyond **Indicator**.  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die without concrete steps.

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrases ""im going to do it"" (strongly implying suicide) and ""pls fucking end me"" are explicit expressions of a desire to die. Emotional indicators include intense loneliness, despair (""nobody cares ever""), and self-loathing (""spoiled piece of shit"").
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No. No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparations (e.g., gathering tools) are mentioned. The phrase ""before the day"" suggests urgency but lacks concrete plans or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"" with a method).
   - **Temporal Context**: The post focuses on *current* emotional distress and a plea for immediate intervention (""end me before the day""). While referencing past statements (""say im going to do it""), it does not describe a past attempt or concrete action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Strongly implied desire to die (""end me"") and explicit threat (""im going to do it"") → **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, preparations, or imminent intent with specifics → **No**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current/future intent, not past actions → **Not ""Attempt""**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""end me"") and implied intent (""im going to do it"") but lacks plans, methods, or descriptions of actions. This aligns with **Ideation** (explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete steps).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The phrase ""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family with a suicide"" directly references suicide. The statement ""I hope it'll be me next"" (referring to stabbings) strongly implies a desire to die, framing death as preferable to familial shame.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Hopelessness (""bring shame"") and defeatism (""thats that"") are present, reinforcing intent.  
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: A method is indirectly specified (death via stabbing), but it relies on external events (""hope it'll be me next""), not active preparation. No tools, locations, or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on future intent (""I hope... next""), with no reference to past attempts or actions.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal intent (""suicide"") and desire to die.  
   - **Ideation**: Fits best. The post expresses a strong desire to die (via stabbing) to avoid shame, with suicide explicitly named. However, it lacks evidence of concrete steps, preparation, or imminent action.  
   - **Behavior**: Unmet. While a method (stabbing) is referenced, it is passive (""hope"") and contingent on external events, not active planning/preparation.  
   - **Attempt**: Excluded. No description of past or ongoing self-harm actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: Yes. The post includes direct phrases like ""killmyself"" (twice) and ""put an end to it all,"" explicitly expressing a desire to die.
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (e.g., ""0 friends,"" ""no skills no job no money""), despair, and shame (""sorry for the bad english"").
   - **Plan/Method Identification**: Yes. The user describes a concrete plan to ""disappear"" (e.g., ""go to another country,"" ""have another identity"") to enable suicide (""kill myself with peace""), framing it as a staged accident. This shows preparation and intent.
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on future intent (""how can I just disappear?"") with no reference to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""killmyself"") and strongly implied (""put an end to it all"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present.  
   - **Verdict**: Strongly indicates suicidal intent beyond vague distress.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific preparatory actions are described (relocating, identity change) to facilitate suicide.  
   - Method is implied (""accident"") though not detailed.  
   - Imminent intent is inferred from urgency (""how can I just disappear?"").  
   - **Verdict**: Actions/preparations align with ""behavior.""  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - No past attempts mentioned; all language is future-oriented.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post exceeds **Indicator** (explicit suicidal intent exists).  
   - It surpasses **Ideation** due to concrete plans/preparations (disappearing, changing identity).  
   - No **Attempt** is described (no past/current actions taken).  
   - Fits **Behavior**: Explicit suicidal intent + preparatory steps (relocation, identity change) to enable suicide.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""tried to kill myself,"" ""ALMOST KILL MYSELF,"" ""I FUCKING WANTED TO [DIE].""  
   - Method described: ""suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag.""  
   - Past action: ""I tried to kill myself last night"" (incomplete due to involuntary breathing).  
   - Preparations/future intent: ""gonna try again tonight,"" with a backup ""Plan B.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme frustration (""WHY! WHY! WHY!""), despair (""THIS NEEDS TO END""), and hopelessness.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct references to suicide (""kill myself,"" ""die"") and explicit desire to die (""I FUCKING WANTED TO [DIE]"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Specific method (suffocation via mask/plastic bag) and preparations (past action + plans for ""tonight"" and ""Plan B"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Past event**: Clear description of a suicide attempt (""last night"") that was initiated but interrupted.  
   - **Future intent**: Plans to re-attempt (""tonight"") with an alternative method.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **concrete past suicide attempt** (""I tried to kill myself last night"") with initiated action (suffocation setup), interrupted involuntarily.  
   - Rules prioritize classifying as 'attempt' for **any past suicide attempt**, even if incomplete or alongside future plans.  
   - While future intent (""gonna try again tonight"") suggests ongoing risk, the explicit description of a **past attempt** overrides classification as 'behavior' or 'ideation'.

I'm just soooo tierd, I just want to sleep 24/7, I feel empty and I'm worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔",0,indicator,"### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key Elements**: The post expresses fatigue (""soooo tired,"" ""want to sleep 24/7""), emotional emptiness (""feel empty""), and anxiety about damaging relationships due to depression. It includes positive life updates (rugby, university, relationships, HRT progress) but emphasizes distress.
   - **Explicit Suicide Mentions**: No explicit or strongly implied references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""suicide,"" or ""end my life""). Emotional distress (emptiness, depression) is present, but without suicidal intent.
   - **Plan or Method Identification**: No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., gathering tools), or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Temporal Context**: Focuses on current feelings and future worries about depressive episodes. No references to past attempts or actions.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator**: Fits best because the post shows distress (fatigue, emptiness, depression) but lacks explicit or strongly implied suicidal ideation, plans, or behaviors. Vague expressions like ""don't want to get out of bed"" or ""feel empty"" indicate general hopelessness without a desire to die. The absence of suicidal intent, methods, or actions keeps this within the Indicator category.
