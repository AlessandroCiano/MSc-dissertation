0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""ending my life"" and ""jump off"" (from a bridge), which are direct references to suicide and death wishes. Phrases like ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" clearly indicate a desire to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""kind of thinking about ending my life again"" suggests ongoing or recurring thoughts, but lacks immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The distress from work is described as happening ""from the past few weeks,"" indicating ongoing issues, not imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method (""jump off"") and location (""a bridge"") are mentioned, which qualifies as a plan. No preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) or research are described, but the explicit reference to a method and location is sufficient for plan assessment.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The word ""again"" in ""thinking about ending my life again"" implies past ideation but does not describe a past attempt or action (e.g., no mention of ""I tried"" or specific actions taken). The post focuses on current thoughts and desires, not completed past actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""ending my life,"" ""jump off"").  
   - A specific plan/method is identified (jumping from a bridge).  
   - According to the rules, this combination (explicit thoughts + plan/method) falls under BEHAVIOR.  
   - There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt, so ATTEMPT does not apply.  
   - Critical rules:  
     - Explicit expressions like ""jump off"" are clear and direct.  
     - ""When in doubt"" between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR: Since a method is mentioned, BEHAVIOR is chosen.  
     - The risk is for the person writing the post, and no other people are mentioned.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**: The post includes the phrase ""I'm going to die soon,"" which is explicitly listed in the framework as a suicide-related phrase (e.g., ""going to die""). This indicates a direct expression of a death wish in the context of distress (""I'm inconsolable"").
2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**: The word ""soon"" suggests future timing but is not immediate (e.g., ""now"" or ""today""), so it indicates a general/ongoing sense of intent rather than current action.
3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**: No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post only expresses a general intent without details.
4. **ACTION HISTORY**: No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The focus is on future intent.
5. **DECISION LOGIC**: The post contains explicit suicide/death wishes (""I'm going to die soon"") but no plan or method. According to the logic, this falls under IDEATION (explicit thoughts without specific plans).

**Critical Rules Applied**:
- Rule 1: ""I'm going to die soon"" is an explicit death wish in distress context.
- Rule 5: No doubt between categories; explicit mention confirms IDEATION over INDICATOR.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains phrases like ""I hate living"" and ""sometime i think about why i have to live,"" which express distress and hopelessness. However, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""want to die,"" or similar explicit phrases). ""Hate living"" implies dissatisfaction but is not an explicit expression of suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""sometime"" indicates general/ongoing thoughts (""sometime i think about""), with no current/immediate urgency (e.g., no ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, locations, or research.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   Since there is NO explicit suicide/death wish mentioned, this falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction but lacks any direct reference to suicide or death.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I hate living"" is implicit distress, not explicit suicide/death mention.  
- When in doubt: No explicit suicide content, so not elevated to IDEATION.  
- Focus is solely on the author's expressions, with no reference to others.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states ""Help me kill myself"" – a direct reference to suicide. ""Kill myself"" is an explicit suicide mention per framework rules.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Phrases like ""Help me"" and ""Please somebody help me"" imply immediate desire for assistance, indicating current urgency.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The request for ""trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal"" specifies a method (drug overdose) and shows active preparation (seeking means). This qualifies as research/seeking methods.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts or self-harm actions. Focus is on current intent.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""kill myself"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - Specific method (barbiturates) + seeking means → Elevates to BEHAVIOR (per rule: ""Seeking information about suicide methods"" = BEHAVIOR).  
   - No description of a completed past action → Rules out ATTEMPT.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Seeking information about suicide methods"" explicitly classifies as BEHAVIOR (Framework section 3).  
- Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR because a method is mentioned (Critical Rule 5b).

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions related to death and dying, such as ""Is there a painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever,"" and ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" These phrases express a desire to die, which qualifies as explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no immediate urgency indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The language reflects ongoing distress (e.g., ""I'm struggling,"" ""I'm tired"") but no past suicide attempts or actions are described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The user explicitly seeks information about suicide methods by asking ""Is there a painless way to die,"" which constitutes research or inquiry into suicide methods. This falls under the BEHAVIOR category, as it involves seeking information about how to die.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors are mentioned. The post discusses life struggles (e.g., unemployment, isolation) but no concrete actions related to suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from Step 1), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - The presence of method-seeking behavior (""Is there a painless way to die"") means this goes beyond IDEATION.  
   - Since there is no description of a past completed attempt, it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR: explicit suicidal thoughts combined with research/seeking information about suicide methods.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""want to kill myself,"" ""i still want to die,"" and ""why shouldn't we just kill ourselves."" These phrases directly reference suicide and a desire to die, satisfying the criteria for explicit content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language indicates ongoing/general thoughts rather than immediate plans: ""for a year straight i was constantly thinking,"" ""i still want to die,"" and ""this all just seems like a huge waste of time."" There are no specific time indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" so urgency is not present.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on philosophical reasons for suicide (e.g., ""life is all pointless,"" ""none of it will matter when you're dead"") without detailing how the person would act on these thoughts.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. References like ""all the things that made me want to kill myself are solved"" describe past thoughts, not actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""want to kill myself""), but there is no evidence of a plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, based on the rules, this falls under IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit phrases like ""want to kill myself"" trigger IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
     - No method/plan means it does not escalate to BEHAVIOR.  
     - No past actions (e.g., ""I tried"") means it is not ATTEMPT.  
     - When in doubt, choosing IDEATION due to explicit suicide mention.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit phrases indicating death wishes: ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" and ""I don't wanna survive it."" These align with phrases like ""want to be gone"" and ""don't want to survive,"" which are explicit expressions of wanting to die or end life. The context of distress reinforces this.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The word ""tonight"" is repeated multiple times, indicating current/immediate intent (e.g., ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight""). There are no references to past events or general/ongoing thoughts without timing.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or research are mentioned. The phrase ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" suggests a desire for self-harm but does not specify a suicide method or plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current desires, not past actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., wanting to be gone, not wanting to survive), but no plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. Therefore, based on the rules:  
     - Explicit death wishes → Not INDICATOR.  
     - No plan/method → Not BEHAVIOR.  
     - No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.  
     - Falls into IDEATION category.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit phrases like ""want to be gone"" and ""don't want to survive"" are sufficient for IDEATION, even with urgency (""tonight"").  
     - No method or plan, so not BEHAVIOR.  
     - When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR only if a method is mentioned; here, none exists, so IDEATION is appropriate.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains the explicit phrase ""I just wanna die,"" which directly expresses a wish for death. This qualifies as an explicit mention of wanting to die, even though the word ""suicide"" is not used. Phrases like ""wanna die"" are included in the framework as death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language indicates ongoing distress (e.g., ""every day,"" ""waking up everyday""), but there are no immediate or time-bound indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The phrase ""I just wanna die"" suggests a general desire, not an immediate plan.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on emotional pain and hopelessness without details on how the person might act.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is about current feelings, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I just wanna die""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is described, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past completed actions are mentioned, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.  
   - Critical rules applied: ""I just wanna die"" is explicit, and when in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to the explicit death mention.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" in the phrase ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself."" This is a direct reference to suicide, even though the person states they don't want to act on it. The framework specifies that intrusive thoughts like this still count as explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language indicates ongoing, general thoughts rather than immediate plans. Words like ""keeps telling me"" and ""sometimes"" suggest persistent but not urgent timing (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The focus is on thoughts (""telling me to kill myself"") without any details on how, where, or when.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself"", ""want to die now"", ""people that want to shoot their heads off like me"", ""erase all traces of my existence"" (death wish equivalent).  
   - Clear expressions of suicidal intent and death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Immediate urgency: ""want to die now, right now in this instant"".  
   - General hopelessness: ""falling down this void for like 5 or 6 years"".

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions related to suicide or death wishes. Specifically, the phrases ""I just want to get it over with"" and ""if I go through with it"" indicate a desire to end suffering, which in the context of distress implies suicidal intent. This aligns with the framework's inclusion of phrases like ""want it to be over"" as explicit mentions of death/suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post expresses current distress (e.g., ""I'm deteriorating,"" ""I just want to get it over with"") but lacks specific urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The fear of pain (""how much it will hurt and how long it's going to last"") suggests contemplation rather than immediate action. Timing is general/ongoing, with no past attempts or events described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The reference to pain (""the pain if I go through with it"") implies consideration of consequences but does not detail a plan, method, or means.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The mention of avoiding a mental hospital (""I refuse to be sent back"") relates to past experiences but does not indicate a suicide attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from step 1), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned (from step 3), so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past completed suicide attempt is described (from step 4), so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION, as it expresses a desire to die without detailing a plan or method.

I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains expressions of emotional distress, hopelessness, and interpersonal difficulties (e.g., ""everyone leaves you eventually,"" ""it still hurts"").  
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die. Phrases like ""I'd leave myself if I could"" are metaphorical and refer to self-abandonment or escape from emotional pain, not literal death or suicide. No terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or equivalent are present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No indicators of immediate or past suicidal urgency (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""I tried""). The language is reflective and general (e.g., ""always,"" ""in my experience""), focusing on ongoing feelings of abandonment.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. The content revolves around relationship patterns and self-reflection, not planning for suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. References to past events are about interpersonal experiences (e.g., people leaving), not suicidal actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the classification falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses distress and hopelessness but lacks any suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt indicators.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is implicit and metaphorical, not explicit suicide content.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""i plan to kill myself at 21,"" which includes direct references to suicide (""kill myself"") and death wishes. This satisfies the criterion for explicit suicide content, even with the qualifier ""whether I want to or not."" Other phrases like ""i wish there was a reset button"" or ""this is hell"" imply distress but do not explicitly reference suicide or death, so the key trigger is the suicide mention.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The suicide plan is future-oriented (""at 21"") with the user currently being 18, indicating no immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). There are no past events described, such as attempts or actions, only ongoing general distress (e.g., ""constant anxiety,"" ""it's only getting worse"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), location (e.g., bridge), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or research is mentioned. The statement ""plan to kill myself at 21"" includes a timing element but lacks concrete details on how the suicide would be carried out, so it does not meet the threshold for a specific plan or method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current emotional and psychological states (e.g., anhedonia, dissociation) rather than any actions taken toward suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""i plan to kill myself""), so the classification cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, ruling out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past suicide attempt is described, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicide ideation but no plan/method, the post fits IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied: Explicit mention requires IDEATION at minimum (Rule #2), and doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR resolves to IDEATION since no method is specified (Rule #5).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""I want to die"" and ""I am not going to kill myself."" Even though the person states they are not acting on these thoughts immediately (""not any time soon""), the explicit references to suicide and dying still qualify under the framework.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post indicates no current urgency, as the person defers action with ""not any time soon"" and ""given myself 5 more years."" The tone is general/ongoing distress (e.g., ""feeling nothing,"" ""crying myself to sleep every night""), but there are no immediate or past timing indicators for suicide.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The person asks for advice on coping (""how to go about existing without feeling anything""), not about suicide methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. Mentions of deactivating social media or social withdrawal are not suicide-related actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to die,"" ""kill myself""), but no plan, method, or preparation is indicated.  
   - This fits the IDEATION category, as defined: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.  
   - The statement about not acting soon does not change the classification, as explicit suicide mentions still count as ideation per the rules.

**Critical Rules Applied:**

14,"It just really bothers me…and I don't really have the guts to do it. I'm on placement at the moment for work, and once these 6 months are over, I do not know what I'm going to do with my life. I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing. I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes. Key phrases include:  
   - ""I feel like the only way out is suicide"" (direct reference to suicide).  
   - ""I think I should just make my escape"" (in context, ""escape"" implies death/suicide, as it follows discussion of the world being ""fucked up"" and contrasts with ""people killing people"").  
   - ""I've considered hanging"" (explicit consideration of suicide method).  
   - ""I don't have the guts to do it"" and ""I can't seem to go through with it"" (acknowledgement of suicidal thoughts without action, but still explicit).  
   This confirms explicit suicide content, ruling out INDICATOR.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no indicators of immediate or urgent plans. Phrases like ""I've considered"" and ""I can't seem to go through with it"" suggest ongoing, general thoughts rather than current intent. The post mentions recurring feelings (""I post on this few times a month""), but no time-bound words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" This points to non-imminent risk.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific suicide method is mentioned: ""hanging."" This is a concrete method listed under the BEHAVIOR category. However, there is no description of preparations (e.g., acquiring materials, writing notes), locations, or research. The phrase ""I've considered hanging"" indicates thought but not action initiation.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No past suicide attempts are described. References to ""tried over and over again"" relate to job struggles, not self-harm or suicide. The consideration of hanging (""I can't seem to go through with it"") does not involve an interrupted or completed action, so it does not qualify as ATTEMPT or past behavior with initiation.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""only way out is suicide""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific method (hanging) is mentioned, so it cannot be IDEATION (which requires no method/plan).  
   - There is no description of past completed actions (e.g., actual overdose or hanging attempt), so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - Since explicit suicidal thoughts are combined with a specific method (hanging), it meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR. The critical rule states: ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" Even though no preparations or actions are described, mentioning the method alone is sufficient for BEHAVIOR.

Final decision: BEHAVIOR, as the post expresses explicit suicidal intent with a specific method (hanging), but no evidence of past attempts or immediate action.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""i'm going to kill myself"" and references suicide through phrases like ""suicidal notes."" This is a direct expression of intent to die, satisfying the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""just a matter of when and how"" indicates planning but does not specify immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The statement ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"" suggests a timeframe within the year, but it is not urgent or immediate.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   While no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, the post describes preparations: ""i already got my suicidal notes ready."" Preparing suicide notes is explicitly listed under BEHAVIOR as a form of preparation.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts or actions (e.g., ""I tried""). The focus is on current plans and preparations, not completed past actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""i'm going to kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There is no specific method, but preparations (suicidal notes) are described. According to the rules, explicit thoughts + ANY preparation (like writing notes) qualifies as BEHAVIOR, not IDEATION.  
   - No past attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Applying the ""When in Doubt"" rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because preparations are mentioned.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post expresses intense self-loathing, body dysmorphia, and desire to escape (""wish I could press a button and be someone else""). However, there are **no explicit mentions** of suicide, death wishes, ending life, or not wanting to be alive. Phrases like ""be someone else"" imply identity replacement, not cessation of life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate time references (""tonight"", ""now"") or past/present suicide actions. Distress is described as ongoing (""I'm tired of..."") but not tied to suicidal timelines.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. Actions described (dying hair, changing clothes) relate to self-image modification, not self-harm or suicide planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No references to past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted suicide actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   Since the post contains **no explicit suicide/death wishes** (only distress and desire for identity change), it meets the criteria for **INDICATOR** classification according to Rule 1: ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR"".

In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post mentions ""going to kill themselves"" and ""are in the process of doing so,"" but this is in reference to other people, not the author themselves. The author is questioning the motives of others who post about suicide. There is no explicit or implicit expression from the author about their own suicidal thoughts, death wishes, or desire to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No indicators of urgency or timing related to the author (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or past attempts). The post is a general inquiry and opinion about others' behavior.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of any specific plans, methods, preparations, or research by the author. The discussion is solely about why others post suicidal content.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm by the author. The post focuses on others' actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die from the author, the classification defaults to INDICATOR. The author expresses an opinion about others seeking help, but does not convey personal distress, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction with their own life. Although the topic involves suicide, the critical rule states that risk classification only applies to the person writing the post, not others mentioned.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The suicide risk corresponds only to the author, who shows no personal suicidal content.  
- No explicit suicide mention from the author → INDICATOR.  
- When in doubt, leaning toward INDICATOR as there is no personal expression of suicide.  
- Must answer with one of the four categories; INDICATOR is the appropriate choice here.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""Im so tired of being alive,"" and ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"" directly reference death wishes/suicide.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""Want to"" implies current desire, but no immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Key past indicator: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed"" confirms prior actions.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, or preparations described for *current* plans.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Explicitly states past suicide attempts: ""ive tried ive failed.""

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
### Step 1: SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION
- The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes:  
  - ""My desire to kill myself has not.""  
  - ""Killing myself is painful, sure.""  
  - ""I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point."" (metaphorical but explicit expression of wanting to die).  
- Even though some phrasing is metaphorical (e.g., ""getting hit by an incoming train""), it directly relates to suicide as a means of escape, confirming explicit suicidal content.

### Step 2: URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS
- Current/immediate indicators: ""has not"" (referring to ongoing desire to kill self), ""at this point"" (indicating present state), and the overall tone of hopelessness (""I don't care anymore"") suggest immediate distress.  
- Past events: References to ""these past few weeks"" and specific overdose attempts.  
- General/ongoing: ""My desire to kill myself has not"" implies persistent thoughts.

### Step 3: PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT
- No specific, concrete plan, method, or preparation for a future suicide attempt is described.  
- The train metaphor (""getting hit by an incoming train"") is hypothetical and not a literal plan (e.g., no mention of location, timing, or concrete steps).  
- Overdose is mentioned only in the context of past actions, not current planning.

### Step 4: ACTION HISTORY
- Clear description of past suicide attempts: ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months.""  
- These are completed actions with intent to die (regardless of outcome), qualifying as past attempts under the framework.

### Step 5: DECISION LOGIC
- Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""desire to kill myself""), but no current plan/method is indicated.  
- However, the post describes past completed suicide attempts (overdoses), which directly triggers the ATTEMPT category according to the decision logic: ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT.""  
- Critical Classification Rule 4 reinforces this: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" Here, past attempts are explicitly stated, even though current ideation is present.  
- There is no ambiguity with BEHAVIOR, as no current plan/preparation is described, and the train metaphor does not constitute a specific method or plan.

### Conclusion
- The presence of past suicide attempts (overdoses) mandates classification as ATTEMPT, per the framework and rules.

My parents would rub in my face about how they were right about me not eating causing me severe issues later on, I'm also scared of being seen weak around them. Please I'm so fucking scared.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains expressions of extreme distress, fear, and feeling overwhelmed (e.g., ""I'm fucking horrified,"" ""keep crying and having panic attacks,"" ""I'm going insane,"" ""it's just too much"").  
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die. Phrases like ""I can't live without estrogen"" are contextual to dependency on hormone therapy for gender transition and do not indicate a desire to end life. Similarly, ""i can't wait until i'm a legal adult"" expresses impatience, not suicidal intent.  
   - No terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""want to die,"" or equivalent phrases are present.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No urgency indicators related to suicide (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""going to"" in a suicidal context) are present. The distress is ongoing but focused on health anxiety and family dynamics.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The reference to DIY HRT is about medical transition, not suicide-related behavior.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions. The post discusses health concerns and fear of parental judgment, not suicidal actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the post does not meet the threshold for IDEATION, BEHAVIOR, or ATTEMPT.  
   - The content aligns with INDICATOR: expressions of severe distress, hopelessness, and life problems (e.g., health anxiety, family issues) without any suicidal elements.  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: All phrases are metaphorical or contextual (e.g., ""I can't live without estrogen"" relates to gender dysphoria, not suicide).  
- When in Doubt: No explicit suicide mention, so INDICATOR is chosen over IDEATION.  
- Risk is solely for the author; no other people are mentioned in a suicidal context.

Now it's time to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""Now it's time to end it"" explicitly expresses a desire to end one's life, which is a direct reference to suicide or death. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content, as ""end it"" is a common euphemism for suicide in the context of distress.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""Now"" indicates current/immediate timing for the suicidal intent. Additionally, the repeated phrase ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" suggests past events, specifically referring to previous actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or location is mentioned for the current suicidal thought (""end it"" is vague). There is also no description of preparations, research, or seeking methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The statement ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" describes multiple past suicide attempts. This is indicated by the context of extreme distress and failed treatments, where ""tried"" implies completed actions taken with the intent to die (e.g., past attempts), even if the outcome was not fatal. This aligns with the definition of ""ATTEMPT"" as a past completed action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (""end it""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Past suicide attempts are described (""I tried...""), which directly qualifies as ATTEMPT according to the classification rules.  
   - Although current suicidal intent (""Now it's time to end it"") is expressed, the critical rules state that if past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, the classification should still be ATTEMPT.  
   - There is no specific plan or method for the current thought, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR on its own.  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The mention of past attempts (""I tried..."") takes precedence, leading to ATTEMPT classification.  
- ""Tried"" is interpreted as describing completed past actions with suicidal intent, regardless of outcome.  
- No ambiguity between categories; ATTEMPT is clear based on action history.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday."" This is a direct reference to suicide, falling under phrases like ""thinking about suicide."" Even though the person also states ""Everyday I am trying to survive,"" the explicit mention of suicide thoughts qualifies this as suicide-related content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""Everyday"" indicates ongoing, general thoughts rather than immediate or specific timing (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). The context is recurrent but not urgent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post only references thoughts of suicide without detailing any plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""In the pas I tried to hide this"" refers to concealing feelings, not a suicide-related action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""thinking about suicide""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is described, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicide thoughts but no plan or method, it fits IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""thinking about suicide"" is an explicit expression, even with the counteracting ""trying to survive,"" similar to intrusive thoughts examples.  
- No doubt between categories: explicit mention rules out INDICATOR; lack of plan rules out BEHAVIOR; no past action rules out ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions death-related content: ""There is no hell so I'm not scared to die."" This expresses a lack of fear of death in a context of distress and hopelessness. More critically, it states, ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April,"" which directly indicates suicidal intent (e.g., ""plan"" and ""date"" imply a specific intention to end life). This qualifies as an explicit expression of wanting to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timing is future-oriented (""early April""), not immediate (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). There are no past attempts described, only current plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post specifies preparations: ""I have a plan, note and date."" This includes having a suicide note and a set timeline, which are clear preparations for suicide, even though no specific method (e.g., pills or hanging) is detailed.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. The references to life events (e.g., dropping out of college, gaining weight) are not suicidal actions.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""actually do go through with it and kill myself,"" and ""suicidal thoughts."" Phrases like ""end up dead in a gutter"" and ""this will probably be my last post ever"" also indicate explicit expressions of wanting to die or cease living.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There is a sense of current/immediate urgency with phrases like ""recently"" (referring to suicidal thoughts), ""still debating on this,"" and ""probably be my last post ever."" However, no specific timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") is mentioned for acting on suicidal thoughts. The focus is on ongoing distress and consideration of future actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping) or location (e.g., bridge) is described. The post mentions considering going to the ER to seek help (""walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward"") or potentially acting on suicidal thoughts (""actually do go through with it and kill myself""), but this does not include details of a plan, preparation, or method for suicide itself. Seeking help is a protective action, not a suicide plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes self-harm (""how many cuts I have all over myself""), but this is presented as existing injuries, not an interrupted or past suicide attempt. No past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself"") are mentioned. The self-harm is contextualized as a result of anger and distress, not as a suicide-related action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned (e.g., how, when, or where to act), so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of a past suicide attempt (completed action with intent to die), so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION, as it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without any specific plan, method, or preparatory actions.  
   - Applying critical rules: The explicit death wishes (e.g., ""kill myself"") confirm IDEATION over INDICATOR. The lack of method/plan details means IDEATION is chosen over BEHAVIOR, per the ""when in doubt"" rule for IDEATION/BEHAVIOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""im suicidal"" – clear references to suicide/death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Uses present tense (""can't kill myself,"" ""I know,"" ""it's possible""), indicating current thoughts but no immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specifies a method (""clif"" [cliff]) and location details (""around 4-5km,"" ""possible to get there""). This shows concrete planning, despite stating inability to ""commit to it.""

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts or self-harm actions. Mentions disclosing suicidal feelings but no physical acts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - Specific method/location described → Exceeds IDEATION.  
   - No completed past action → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - Plan + preparation details (identifying/researching location) → Matches BEHAVIOR.  
   - ""Can't commit to it"" implies interrupted intent, which still qualifies as BEHAVIOR per Critical Rule 3.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""i'm tired of my life,"" ""i just want it all to stop,"" ""i wish i was never born""). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die. Phrases like ""i wish i was never born"" reflect regret about existence but do not explicitly state a desire to end one's current life. Similarly, ""i just want it all to stop"" is vague and could refer to emotional pain relief rather than suicide. No terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die,"" ""end my life,"" or equivalent explicit phrases are present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post describes ongoing distress (e.g., ""every night,"" ""always,"" ""everyday"") but no immediate or urgent suicidal timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" There are no references to past suicide attempts or actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The content focuses solely on emotional experiences and life difficulties.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the post falls under INDICATOR according to the rule: ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR."" The content aligns with the INDICATOR category, which includes expressions of severe distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal intent.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**  
- No explicit suicide/death phrases, so INDICATOR is appropriate.  
- ""I wish I was never born"" is not considered an explicit death wish; it indicates regret but not current suicidal ideation.  
- ""I just want it all to stop"" is implicit distress, not explicit suicide content.  
- No doubt between categories requires escalation to IDEATION, as per rules.

28,"Depressed. This month has already been a shit show, texted my mom I think I need to be on anti depressants and she just said 'schedule a doctors appointment' not 'are you okay? Do you want to talk?' I can't wait to fucking kill myself and have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral. It's gonna be one last big fuck you",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself,"" which directly references suicide and a desire to die. Phrases like ""have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral"" reinforce death-related themes. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""I can't wait to"" suggests current desire and eagerness, indicating present-focused intent. However, it lacks specific timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" so it conveys strong immediacy but not a concrete timeframe.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location (e.g., bridge) is described. There is no mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) or research into methods. The funeral reference is about consequences, not the act itself.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post does not describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. It focuses on current thoughts and future intentions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. Therefore, based on the rules:
     - Explicit suicide mention → Not INDICATOR.
     - No plan/method → IDEATION (not BEHAVIOR).
     - No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - Critical rules applied: The explicit mention of suicide overrides any distress-only interpretation (e.g., ""depressed"" or family issues), and no method shifts it away from BEHAVIOR. The ""can't wait"" phrase does not constitute a plan without specifics.

**Conclusion:** The post falls under IDEATION due to clear expressions of suicidal intent without evidence of a plan or method.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit expressions related to suicide: ""end it all"" and ""goodbye everybody"" clearly indicate a desire to die or commit suicide. This is not vague distress; it directly references ending one's life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The user mentions ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks,"" indicating a future plan rather than immediate action. There is no ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but the phrase ""ready to just end it all"" shows current intent with a specific timeline.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The user states, ""I already know how I'm gonna do it,"" which explicitly indicates a specific plan or method for suicide, even though the exact method is not detailed. This constitutes preparation and planning under the BEHAVIOR category.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The phrase ""all ready tried that before"" refers to past communication attempts (""tell anyone""), not a past suicide attempt. There is no description of a completed suicide action (e.g., overdose, self-harm) that occurred in the past. Thus, this does not meet the criteria for ATTEMPT.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""end it all"").  
   - A plan/method is mentioned (""know how I'm gonna do it""), so this elevates it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past suicide attempt is described; the reference to ""tried that before"" is about communication, not suicide actions.  
   - Applying critical rules:  
     - Explicit suicide mention rules out INDICATOR.  
     - Plan/method mentioned (even if not detailed) triggers BEHAVIOR over IDEATION.  
     - No completed past action rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - Final decision: BEHAVIOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""I can't even fucking kill my self"" and ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it."" The phrase ""kill my self"" is a direct reference to suicide, and ""did it"" contextually refers to committing suicide. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language expresses current distress (e.g., ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it""), but there are no specific time-bound indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The focus is on an ongoing struggle rather than immediate action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is mentioned: ""I hold the blade,"" which refers to using a blade for suicide. This indicates a plan involving a concrete method, and the act of holding the blade shows preparation or initiation of behavior.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The phrase ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" describes an interrupted action—initiating self-harm or suicide with a blade but not completing it. There is no mention of a past completed suicide attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill my self""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific method (blade) and action (holding it) are mentioned, so it cannot be IDEATION.  
   - The interrupted action (holding the blade but not completing) falls under BEHAVIOR, as per Critical Classification Rule 3.  
   - No past completed attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Applying the rule ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned"" confirms BEHAVIOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""how about i die then"" explicitly expresses a death wish in the context of distress (""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?""). This meets the threshold for explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The statement uses present-tense phrasing (""how about i die then"") but lacks immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The tone suggests current ideation rather than past events.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on frustration with family/society, not actionable suicide plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No descriptions of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wish is present (""die"") → Rules out INDICATOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit phrases: ""killing myself will happen"", ""taking my own life"" – clear expressions of suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Future timeframe (""will happen"", ""not live to see my 40th birthday in 2023"") but no immediate timing (e.g., ""today""). Uncertainty about timing noted (""When it will happen I am unsure"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, or preparations described. Only general intent to act in the future.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past attempts or actions. ""At least I DID try"" refers to life efforts, not suicide attempts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts confirmed (rules out INDICATOR).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit phrases: ""kill myself"" (mentioned twice), ""perfect opportunity to kill myself,"" and ""everyday I want to go back and kill myself."" These are direct expressions of suicide intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""everyday I want to go back and kill myself"" indicates ongoing ideation. The reference to ""6 months ago"" is a past event, but there are no immediate timing cues (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The ""perfect opportunity"" is vague and lacks concrete details about plans or means.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The user references a past event (""I had the perfect opportunity... I was a pussy"") but explicitly states they did not act (""I shouldn’t have talked myself down""). This describes contemplation, not an actual attempt or interrupted action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"").  
   - No plan/method/preparation is described for current or future actions.  
   - The past reference does not constitute an attempt (no completed action).  
   - Classification falls under **IDEATION** (explicit death wishes without plans/methods).

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post describes feelings of weakness, embarrassment, hopelessness, and being used (e.g., ""I'm too weak,"" ""I'm pathetic,"" ""I know it's never gonna happen"").  
   - There is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, wanting to die, or phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""want to be dead,"" or similar. The distress is focused on social relationships and self-perception, not on ending life.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No time-sensitive words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to"" in a suicidal context. References to time (e.g., ""last week,"" ""two weeks"") relate to the ultimatum with the friend, not suicide.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No discussion of suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The content is entirely about interpersonal conflict and emotional struggle.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. The phrase ""I tried at first"" refers to attempting to cut off the friend, not a suicide-related action.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide/death content (only expressions of distress and hopelessness), this falls under INDICATOR according to the rules.  
   - Rule application:  
     - No explicit death wishes → INDICATOR.  
     - When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose INDICATOR as there is no suicide mention.  

**CONCLUSION:** The post expresses severe emotional distress and feelings of worthlessness but lacks any explicit suicidal ideation, plans, or actions. It aligns with the INDICATOR category (distress without explicit suicide content).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes:  
   - ""I just want to not exist"" (direct desire to cease existing)

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate/current timing cues (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") related to suicide.  
   - Distress is ongoing (""I feel nothing but sadness,"" ""cycle for years"") but lacks urgency tied to suicidal action.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned. The phrase ""metaphorically kill myself"" explicitly negates literal intent.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including:  
   - ""i'm on suicide watch"" (direct reference to suicide)  
   - ""i could take a bunch of pills"" (method-specific suicidal thought)  
   - ""i wish i could just fucking end it"" (explicit desire to end life)  
   - ""subjectively it would be better if i was dead"" (death wish)  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""i could take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep"" suggests a current, contemplative thought with implied timing (during sleep), but it lacks high-immediacy words like ""tonight"" or ""now.""  
   - Other elements like ""ive been just getting by for almost twenty years"" indicate ongoing distress, not a past attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""end it,"" ""better if i was dead""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific method (pills) is mentioned, which moves it beyond IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Hesitation (e.g., ""too scared,"" ""don't want to die in pain"") does not override the presence of explicit thoughts and a method, as per rules.  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit suicide content is confirmed (e.g., ""suicide watch,"" ""end it"").  
- ""Take a bunch of pills"" constitutes a specific method, triggering BEHAVIOR classification.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

   - No details about the author's method for their 2009 attempt, but they reference a ""very serious attempt"" that ""almost succeeded.""  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Author states: ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded"" – a clear past completed action with intent to die.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit mention of a past suicide attempt (completed action) → **ATTEMPT** per classification rules.  
   - *Note*: Current stability (""in a good place now"") doesn’t override past attempt classification. Friend’s situation is not considered.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Past vs. Present"": Focus on author’s past attempt.  
- ""When in Doubt"": Past completed action = ATTEMPT.

39,"I'm scared therapy wont work. My parents realized 'omg hey our kid isn't really doing all that well' and now I'm going to therapy. Which is good. But I worry therapy won't work. Even on days where I'm actually happy I still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts. And it's tempting a lot of the time. I'm tired of always being afraid and upset over little things, I'm tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation. I wish I could be so much better than I am so I didn't live every moment in shame. Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post includes the phrase ""lol kermit sewer slide,"" which is a known euphemism for ""suicide"" (derived from ""suicide"" phonetically). This is an explicit reference to suicide thoughts. Additionally, the user states these thoughts are ""tempting a lot of the time,"" indicating a direct engagement with suicidal ideation.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The suicidal thoughts are described as recurring (""I still get the... thoughts"") and general/ongoing (""a lot of the time""), with no indicators of immediate intent (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The context focuses on persistent feelings rather than a specific timeline.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post only references thoughts and feelings, not concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The user discusses thoughts only, not actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (via ""kermit sewer slide"" reference), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is described, ruling out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past suicide attempt is mentioned, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the classification is IDEATION, as there are explicit expressions of wanting to die or suicidal thoughts without specific plans.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- The ""kermit sewer slide"" phrase is explicit in context, even as slang, and qualifies as a death wish.  
- Intrusive thoughts (""still get the... thoughts"") with temptation are sufficient for IDEATION, even without intent to act.  
- No doubt between categories: Explicit mention confirms IDEATION over INDICATOR; no method confirms IDEATION over BEHAVIOR.

40,"I hate myself so much. Overall I'm terrible. And I know I'm objective because there are some good things about me, I have a few talents and positive traits. But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good but I'm a coward and don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit expressions of suicidal intent, including: ""I want to kill myself so badly,"" ""if I did kill myself,"" and ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"" Phrases like ""I wish I was never born"" and ""want to be gone"" also indicate death wishes. Additionally, ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train"" explicitly references suicide. Therefore, explicit suicide content is present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language suggests current and ongoing suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to kill myself so badly,"" ""It's looking pretty good""), but there are no specific immediate time indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The tone is more general/ongoing, with expressions of desire rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is mentioned: ""jump in front of a train,"" which indicates a plan involving a location (train tracks). Preparations are also discussed, such as concerns about ""end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc),"" showing consideration of logistical details. The request ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"" implies seeking encouragement to act, further supporting behavioral elements.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried""). References to actions are hypothetical or future-oriented (e.g., ""if I did kill myself""), with no description of completed or interrupted attempts in the past.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""want to kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific plan/method (""jump in front of a train"") and preparations (dealing with belongings) are mentioned, so it exceeds IDEATION.  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Applying the rules: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, the presence of any method/plan means BEHAVIOR is the correct classification.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I want to kill myself"" and ""everyone would be better off with me dead."" This is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts and death wishes, including phrases like ""want to kill myself"" and references to being dead.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language expresses current distress (e.g., ""i cant breathe,"" ""im useless"") but does not specify immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past actions. It focuses on present feelings without urgency indicators.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post only expresses a desire to die without detailing how it might be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is solely about current thoughts and emotions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on the rules, this falls under IDEATION (explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or methods).

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit mentions like ""I want to kill myself"" trigger IDEATION, even if the person expresses distress.  
- No method/plan means it cannot be escalated to BEHAVIOR.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION and others, IDEATION is chosen due to explicit suicide content.

42,"confinement mental break down. i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it. i am growing more depressed and feeling more alone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""i thought about slitting my wrists today,"" which refers to a suicide method (slitting wrists). This is an explicit expression of suicidal intent, as it involves wanting to die or end life through a specific action.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The word ""today"" indicates current/immediate timing, showing the thought is recent and present-focused.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The method ""slitting my wrists"" is specified, which is a concrete suicide method. This goes beyond general thoughts of death and includes a plan element.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** The post states ""but i didnt do it,"" confirming no action was taken. This is not a past attempt or interrupted action (e.g., no description of initiating the act), so it does not qualify as an attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""thought about slitting my wrists"").
   - A specific method is mentioned (""slitting my wrists"").
   - According to the framework, explicit thoughts with a specific method or plan classify as BEHAVIOR, even if no action was taken.
   - The additional context (""growing more depressed and feeling more alone"") does not override the explicit suicide content with a method.

**Critical Rules Applied:**
- Explicit mention of suicide method triggers BEHAVIOR.
- ""Thought about"" with a method is sufficient for BEHAVIOR, as per the category definition (mentioning specific methods).
- No past completed action, so not ATTEMPT.
- Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because a method is specified.

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts with a specific method, aligning with the BEHAVIOR category.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal feelings are coming back."" This is a direct reference to suicidal thoughts, satisfying the requirement for explicit suicide/death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""coming back"" implies recurring thoughts but lacks immediacy (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The context suggests ongoing distress rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The focus is on emotional distress and dental pain, not concrete suicide plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" references thoughts, not actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""suicidal feelings"") → Rules out **INDICATOR**  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Rules out **BEHAVIOR**  
   - No description of past attempts → Rules out **ATTEMPT**  
   - Explicit thoughts without plans → Matches **IDEATION**  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- ""Suicidal feelings"" is an explicit expression of ideation.  
- No ambiguity with other categories per rules:  
  - IDEATION confirmed due to explicit mention without plans.  
  - Past depression is noted, but current suicidal thoughts are active.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states ""i'm someone who wants to die,"" which directly expresses a desire for death. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""wants to die"" is in the present tense but lacks immediate urgency indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). It appears general and ongoing, not tied to a specific timeline.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research. The focus is on seeking help for basic necessities, not suicide planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post only references current feelings, not actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""wants to die"") are present.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.  
   - Therefore, based on the logic: Explicit thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- ""Wants to die"" is an explicit expression, ruling out INDICATOR.  
- No method/plan supports IDEATION over BEHAVIOR.  
- No past attempt mentioned, so not ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes,"" ""I'm leaving soon,"" and ""goodbye letters,"" which directly reference suicide, death, or ending one's life. Phrases like ""leaving soon"" and ""goodbye letters"" in this context indicate a wish to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Words like ""soon"" and ""my minds made up"" suggest current/immediate intent, indicating the person is planning to act in the near future.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The person is specifically asking for help with ""how to write good suicide notes,"" which is a preparation step for suicide. Writing suicide notes is part of the planning and preparation process, even if the method itself (e.g., pills, jumping) isn't detailed.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts or actions. The post focuses on current preparations and intentions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (via ""suicide notes"" and related phrases).  
   - There is also a specific preparation mentioned (writing suicide notes), so this meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Per critical rules: This is not INDICATOR due to explicit suicide mention, and the preparation element moves it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR (Rule 5: between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if any method/plan is mentioned).

I just hoped I could get some comfort if there was any left with my psych before I end thing v v soon. save some flowers for me please? I like lavender",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**: The post explicitly mentions suicide multiple times, including ""suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon"" (implying ending life), and references to ""suicidality."" Phrases like ""I didn't die last night"" and ""constant attempts"" also involve death or suicide, confirming explicit content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**: There is high urgency with specific timing: ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it"" and ""doubt ill make it that long,"" indicating immediate risk. The phrase ""v v soon"" reinforces this. Past events are noted with ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" and ""only reason I didn't die last night,"" showing a history of suicidal actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**: A specific suicide date is mentioned, but no concrete method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparations, or research is described. The date implies planning but lacks actionable details like how or where.

4. **ACTION HISTORY**: The user describes ""8 yrs of constant attempts,"" which are past completed suicide actions (regardless of outcome). The statement ""only reason I didn't die last night"" suggests a recent interrupted or non-fatal attempt, and ""struggle with sh/suicidality"" indicates ongoing self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC**: 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present, so not INDICATOR.
   - Past suicide attempts are described (""constant attempts"" and the near-attempt last night), which directly triggers the ATTEMPT category per the rules: ""If describes past suicide attempt → ATTEMPT"" and ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" 
   - Although a suicide date (current plan) is mentioned, the focus on past completed actions overrides other classifications. No specific method or preparation is detailed, so BEHAVIOR is not the primary focus.

No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I want to disappear forever"" (equivalent to death wish), ""I know I will die by 35"" (declaration of expected death).  
   - Context: Distress about heaven/God preventing disappearance reinforces death-focused intent.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Non-immediate timing: ""I will die by 35"" (future timeframe from age 22).  
   - General hopelessness: ""I am sick of everybody's fascination..."", ""I want to be the missing pixel..."".  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research mentioned.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No descriptions of past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit death wishes (""disappear forever"", ""die by 35"") → Rules out **INDICATOR**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Rules out **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - No past suicide actions → Rules out **ATTEMPT**.  
   - Clear suicidal ideation without actionable plans → Matches **IDEATION**.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Disappear forever"" and ""die by 35"" are explicit death wishes per Rule 1 (contextual distress).  
- Ambivalence (""pain caused to people I care about"") doesn’t negate ideation per Rule 2.

1. **Suicide Content Identification:** The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including ""kill yourself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""taking these pills,"" and ""I'm trying to die."" These phrases directly reference suicide and the desire to die, satisfying the criteria for explicit suicide content.
   
2. **Urgency and Timing Indicators:** The language indicates current contemplation but no immediate urgency. Phrases like ""idk if hanging myself would even work"" and ""I'm trying to die"" suggest an ongoing evaluation of suicide, without specific time-bound words (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The emojis (😂 and 😎) may imply a casual tone, but the content remains focused on present thoughts.

3. **Plan/Method Assessment:** Specific suicide methods are discussed in detail, such as hanging (with concerns about weight and structural failure) and pill overdose (with evaluation of dosage and risks like sickness or brain damage). This constitutes planning and method assessment, as the person is actively researching or considering how to carry out suicide effectively.

4. **Action History:** No past suicide attempts are described. The post discusses hypothetical scenarios (e.g., ""might just break the shower"" or ""might be enough to make me sick"") but does not reference any completed actions, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors that occurred in the past. The phrase ""I'm trying to die"" reflects current intent, not a historical event.

5. **Decision Logic:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (ruling out INDICATOR).
   - Specific plans and methods are mentioned (hanging and pills), so this exceeds IDEATION.
   - No past completed actions are described, so it does not meet ATTEMPT.
   - Therefore, based on explicit suicide thoughts combined with specific methods and planning, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Rules Applied:**
- Explicit vs. Implicit: All suicide references are explicit (e.g., ""kill yourself,"" ""I'm trying to die"").
- When in Doubt: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, BEHAVIOR is chosen due to method mentions.
- Risk applies only to the author, and the classification must be one of the four options.

   - Current desire: ""I want to die"" (present tense).  
   - But counterbalanced by: ""I'm probably not gonna do anything"" (no immediacy).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""i wonder why i didnt take them all"" in reference to pills, which implies a desire to overdose and die. This is an explicit expression of wanting to die, as ""take them all"" suggests consuming all pills to end life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrases ""every night"" and ""every day"" indicate ongoing, recurring thoughts rather than immediate urgency. There are no words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" suggesting current intent to act.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The method of suicide is specified: pills. Additionally, ""every night i count my pills"" describes a preparatory behavior, showing engagement with the means of suicide (pills) and potential planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt (e.g., ""I tried to take them all""). The phrase ""why i didnt take them all"" refers to inaction, not a past action with intent to die. This is not an interrupted attempt (like starting to take pills and stopping), as no action was initiated.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (wanting to die by taking pills).  
   - A specific method (pills) and preparation (counting pills nightly) are mentioned.  
   - This meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR, as there are explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a method and preparatory behavior.  
   - It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.  
   - It is not IDEATION because a method is specified, and not INDICATOR because suicide/death is explicitly referenced.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post mentions ""thoughts"" being ""unbearably strong"" and a ""major downward spiral,"" but there is no explicit reference to suicide, death wishes, wanting to die, or phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""want to be dead."" The phrase ""I don't want to end up in the psych ward again"" implies past mental health issues but does not explicitly state suicide or death-related content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post uses terms like ""lately,"" ""past few months,"" and ""everyday,"" indicating ongoing distress without immediate urgency (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The reference to the ""psych ward again"" suggests a past mental health incident but does not describe a specific suicide attempt (e.g., no details of actions like an overdose or self-harm with intent to die). This is insufficient for classifying as ATTEMPT.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the post falls under INDICATOR. It expresses distress, hopelessness (""downward spiral,"" ""struggle,"" ""don't know what to do""), and life dissatisfaction without any suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: The distress is implicit but not explicitly tied to suicide.  
- When in Doubt: With no explicit suicide content, INDICATOR is chosen over IDEATION.  
- Focus: Only the writer's experience is considered, with no actionable suicide risk elements.

I've asked 3 boys out and got rejected each time because of my looks. I don't think I'll ever find my soulmate and I've lost all will to live. I know it sounds so stupid to want to die over not having a boyfriend but it's seriously affecting my mental health.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I've lost all will to live"" and ""want to die,"" which directly reference death wishes and a desire to not be alive. This satisfies the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight,"" ""today,"" or ""now."" The language is general and ongoing (e.g., ""I don't think I'll ever,"" ""seriously affecting my mental health""), indicating persistent feelings rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on emotional distress and hopelessness without detailing any plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The references to rejections and dating are unrelated to suicide actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to die,"" ""lost all will to live""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past suicide attempt is described, so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the classification is IDEATION based on explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit mentions include: ""my death,"" ""I don't want to live anymore,"" and ""when I off myself"" (colloquial for suicide). These are clear expressions of death wishes.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate time references (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). Phrases like ""can't continue to live for decades"" suggest ongoing distress, not imminent action.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research mentioned. ""Off myself"" implies intent but lacks concrete details.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""don't want to live,"" ""off myself"").  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → **IDEATION**.  
   - Conflict about consequences (impact on mother) doesn’t negate explicit suicidal intent.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit phrases like ""off myself"" trigger IDEATION regardless of hesitation (Rule 1, 2).  
- No method → not BEHAVIOR; no past action → not ATTEMPT.  
- When explicit suicide intent exists without plans, default to IDEATION (Rule 5).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mention of ""killing myself"" appears in the phrase: ""just killing myself because what's the point in not"". This directly references suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Future intent indicated by ""going to end up"" and ""i know that..."", suggesting contemplation rather than immediate action. No words like ""tonight"" or ""now"".

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research mentioned.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thought (""killing myself"") is present → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Rules out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a completed past action → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - Falls under IDEATION due to explicit death wish without actionable details.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Killing myself"" is explicit suicide content (Rule 1).  
- Conditional phrasing (""going to end up"") still qualifies as ideation (Rule 2).  
- No method → IDEATION (Rule 5).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit suicide mention: ""tried to kms yesterday"" (""kms"" = kill myself).  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Past event: ""yesterday"" (completed action).  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method or plan mentioned (only ""tried to kms"").  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Concrete past action: ""tried to kms yesterday"" (attempted suicide).  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention + past completed action → **ATTEMPT** (per rules: ""describes past suicide attempt"" → ATTEMPT).  
   - Depression mention (""depressed af"") doesn't override explicit attempt description.  
   - No current plan/method needed for ATTEMPT classification when past action is confirmed.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes: ""I cant live anymore"" and ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" (where ""do this"" contextually implies ending life). The phrases ""cannot fight anymore"" and ""non stop pain and suffering"" further support distress, but the key is the direct statement ""I cant live anymore.""

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The phrase ""non stop for 28 years"" indicates chronic suffering, not imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The mention of ""a non painful way"" suggests contemplation of methods but lacks specificity (e.g., no pills, locations, or preparations). This is vague and does not constitute a plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. Focus is on current emotional state.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wish is present (""cant live anymore"") → Ruled out INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan/method/preparation → Ruled out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of past suicide actions → Ruled out ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"" and refers to suicide via ""do it"" (contextually meaning suicide). Phrases like ""write a suicide note"" further confirm explicit suicide content.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Specifies future timing (""next week"") and preparatory actions (writing a note), indicating planned rather than immediate intent.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Clearly mentions a specific method (""with drugs"") and describes concrete preparations (""write a suicide note for my family"").  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts or self-harm actions. Focuses on future plans.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to kill myself"").  
   - Specific method (drugs) and preparations (suicide note) are detailed.  
   - **Classification = BEHAVIOR** (suicidal thoughts + plan/preparation).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" is identified as an explicit expression of wanting to end life or suffering, similar to ""want it to be over"" as specified in the framework. This occurs in the context of severe distress (e.g., hopelessness, loneliness, and frustration with life), making it an explicit death wish.  
   - No other explicit mentions of suicide, death, or wanting to die are present (e.g., no direct phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""want to die"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""Soon"" indicates a sense of imminence but not immediate urgency (e.g., not ""tonight"" or ""now"").  
   - ""Long overdue"" suggests a prolonged desire but no specific timing for action.  
   - No past suicide events or attempts are described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or locations are mentioned. The reference to ""pills"" is in the context of medication not working for illness, not as a suicide plan.  
   - No preparations, research, or seeking of methods described.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The mention of past actions (e.g., ""like I did on Thanksgiving"") refers to eating fast food, not suicide-related.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wish is present (""get this over with"" interpreted as wanting to end life).  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.  
   - No past attempt described.  
   - Therefore, based on the rules: Explicit thoughts without plan → IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied: ""When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention"" and ""explicit vs. implicit"" guidance confirms ""get this over with"" is explicit in distress context.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft,"" which refers to a suicide-related action (overdosing on medication).  
   - Phrases like ""I just want my suffering to be over"" express distress but are not explicit death wishes, especially since the user states ""I don't want to die.""

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains phrases like ""I'm doing it,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" and ""I'm ready to go,"" which, in the context of distress and finality (e.g., feeling ""at peace"" and ""ready"" after spending time with a favorite person), are explicit expressions of death wishes. ""It"" and ""go"" are euphemisms for suicide or ending life, falling under the framework's examples like ""going to die"" or ""want to be gone."" This constitutes an explicit mention of suicide/death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""in the near future"" indicates a non-immediate but definite timeline. It is not current (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") but rather future-oriented, suggesting planning without immediate action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or research are mentioned. The references to ""doing it"" and ""ready to go"" are vague and lack concrete details about how suicide would be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content focuses solely on future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (as identified in step 1).  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, ruling out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION, as it expresses a desire to die without specific plans or methods.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: The phrases are explicit in context, per the rule that euphemisms like ""ready to go"" count as death wishes.  
- When in doubt: Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen due to explicit suicide mention. No doubt between other categories.  
- Focus is solely on the author, with no references to others.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""i was suicidal"". This is a direct reference to suicidal thoughts, which qualifies as an explicit expression of death wishes or wanting to die, even though it is in the past tense.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The reference to suicide is clearly past: ""it was 4 yrs ago"". There are no current or immediate indicators (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"") suggesting present risk.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide are mentioned. The post focuses on the school's response to the person's past suicidal state, not on any actionable details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, interrupted attempt, or self-harm behavior. The phrase ""i was suicidal"" indicates ideation (thoughts) rather than an action taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**

   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it cannot be BEHAVIOR.
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt (e.g., overdose, cutting), so it cannot be ATTEMPT.
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION, as it contains explicit expressions of wanting to die or suicidal thoughts without any specific plans or methods.
   - Critical rules applied:
     - Explicit mention of suicide (""suicidal"") triggers IDEATION over INDICATOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit phrases present: ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ""Might as well just die."" Both directly express death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Uses ""Should I"" (present consideration) and references ongoing struggles (""everyday,"" ""not the first time""). No immediate time-bound indicators like ""tonight.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research. The suicidal expressions remain abstract.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Describes historical sadness and panic attacks but no mention of past suicide attempts, self-harm actions, or interrupted attempts.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of suicide and death wishes, including:  
   - ""i should die"" (direct statement of wanting to die)  
   - ""I had made up my mind to kill myself"" (explicit mention of suicide intent)  
   - Contextual phrases like ""I don't think it makes any sense that they have to raise me"" and ""I am just rubbish"" imply hopelessness, but the explicit references to death/suicide dominate.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The decision was made in the recent past (""a few days"" ago).  
   - Current state is indicated by ""I have prepared everything"" (present perfect tense, showing completion of preparations).  
   - No immediate timing words (e.g., ""now"" or ""tonight""), but the preparation suggests impending action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The phrase ""I have prepared everything"" explicitly describes preparations for suicide.  
   - While no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location is mentioned, ""prepared everything"" constitutes a general but concrete preparation, which falls under the BEHAVIOR category definition (""describing preparations"").

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no mention of a past completed suicide attempt (e.g., no description of actions like overdosing or jumping).  
   - ""I had made up my mind"" refers to a decision, not an action. ""Prepared everything"" is a preparatory step, not a completed attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Suicide thoughts are combined with specific preparations (""I have prepared everything""), which meets the BEHAVIOR criteria (""explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations"").  
   - No evidence of a past completed attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Applying the ""when in doubt"" rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, BEHAVIOR is chosen due to the mention of preparations.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit references to death and suicide, such as ""vanish without a trace,"" ""no one will find my body,"" and ""at the end"" (implying the end of life). The mention of a ""pistol"" as an item to have ""at the end"" directly associates with suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The plan is future-oriented and conditional, based on being asked to leave by roommates (""eventually,"" ""when that happens""). There are no immediate time indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but the intent is clear for when the trigger occurs.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods are mentioned: using a ""pistol"" to end life.  
   - Detailed preparations are described: emptying the bank account, leaving belongings, walking to a secluded spot with no traceable items, and planning to have the pistol at the end.  
   - The location is specified as a ""secluded spot where no one will find my body.""

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The post focuses solely on future plans.

   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (wanting to vanish/die).  
   - A specific method (pistol) and detailed preparations (financial and logistical steps) are outlined.  
   - According to the rules, this fits BEHAVIOR: explicit suicidal thoughts with a plan/method/preparation.  
   - It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed actions are described, and not IDEATION or INDICATOR due to the presence of a method and plan.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit phrases like ""vanish without a trace"" and ""no one will find my body"" count as death wishes in context.  
- The pistol is a clear method, and preparations (e.g., emptying accounts, secluding oneself) indicate behavior.  
- No doubt between categories: BEHAVIOR is the best fit.

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

   - Explicit mentions: ""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years,"" ""when i do do it,"" ""making it easier to do something,"" ""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it.""  
   - Death wishes: ""I dont want the existance ive got,"" ""I want a long term fix"" (contextually tied to suicidal feelings).  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Ongoing: ""always there,"" ""this will come back around again.""  
   - Imminent risk: ""Im on the edge... a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge.""  
   - Past: References 10-year history, but no past attempts described.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific location: ""the woodland where i would do it.""  
   - Preparations: ""leave notes on the paths to warn dog walkers... call the police,"" avoidance of home to delay discovery.  
   - Method implied (though not named) via location/note strategy.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No past attempts described (only childhood self-harm, unrelated to suicide).  
   - Current actions: Planning logistics (location, notes) but no initiated actions like acquiring means.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide ideation confirmed (""suicidal,"" ""do it"").  
   - Specific plan (location + notes) and preparations present → **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - No past attempt described → rules prioritize current plan over history.  
   - Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Plan details trigger BEHAVIOR classification per rules.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore . I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit phrases like ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore."" These directly express a desire to die or commit suicide, fitting the criteria for explicit mentions (e.g., ""killing self,"" ""wanting to die,"" or ""not wanting to be alive"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The suicidal expressions (""wanna off myself,"" ""don't wanna live anymore"") are in present tense, indicating current feelings, but there are no specific time-bound words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" No past attempts or actions are described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research related to suicide. The statements are general expressions of desire without actionable details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post describes frustration over a driver's license issue and family conflict but no references to past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. The focus is on emotional distress, not historical behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I wanna off myself,"" ""don't wanna live anymore""), but no plan, method, or preparation is indicated. This aligns with the IDEATION category.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit phrases trigger IDEATION over INDICATOR, even if distress is general.  
     - No method or plan means IDEATION, not BEHAVIOR.  
     - No past actions, so not ATTEMPT.

No one in my life cares. I have no one to talk to. I have no one to help me stay alive. No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicidal"", ""tonight's the night I guess"", ""help me stay alive"", ""miss me when I'm gone""  
   - Clear expressions of active suicidal intent (e.g., ""tonight's the night"") and desire to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Immediate timing: ""tonight"" indicates imminent risk.  
   - Context: ""Feeling kinda desperate"" and ""hopeless"" reinforce urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons) or location mentioned.  
   - No descriptions of preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Mentions calling a hotline (help-seeking, not an attempt).  
   - No references to past attempts or self-harm actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide intent present (""suicidal"", ""tonight's the night"").  
   - **No plan/method/preparation described** → IDEATION.  
   - Urgency (""tonight"") doesn’t override lack of method (per rules).  
   - Hotline call is help-seeking, not an attempt.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit suicide mention → Escalates beyond INDICATOR.  
- No method/plan → Not BEHAVIOR.  
- No past action → Not ATTEMPT.  
- ""I want to be gone"" contextually explicit → IDEATION.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""cutting an artery"" and ""taking oxy"" (oxycodone) to lessen pain during this act. ""Cutting an artery"" is a direct method for causing death, and the context of combining it with a painkiller to facilitate the process indicates an explicit focus on suicide or ending life. The phrase ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain a lot when cutting an artery?"" confirms this is about suicide, not just self-harm, as the intent is to reduce barriers to dying.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" and no references to past events. The post is framed as a question about method effectiveness, suggesting contemplation rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post specifies a method (""cutting an artery"") and a means to facilitate it (""taking oxy""). Additionally, the user is seeking information (""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain...?""), which constitutes research about suicide methods, as defined in the BEHAVIOR category.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors is present. The content is forward-looking, focused on planning and inquiry.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is identified (method of death via artery cutting).  
   - A specific method and research are mentioned, so this is not IDEATION (which lacks plans/methods).  
   - No past completed action is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - The presence of a method and information-seeking aligns with BEHAVIOR, as per the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.""  
   - Critical Rule 5 applies: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because a method is mentioned.  
   - Critical Rule 2 reinforces that even indirect expressions (like this question) count as explicit when context involves suicide methods.

Conclusion: The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts with specific methods and information-seeking, meeting the criteria for BEHAVIOR.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post discusses the friend's statements: ""I'm going to die,"" ""I'm going to kill myself,"" and ""commit suicide."" However, these are reported as the friend's words, not the user's own expressions. The user does not explicitly state any personal desire to die, end their life, or commit suicide. Phrases like ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"" indicate coping, not suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - There are no indicators of current, immediate, or past suicidal thoughts or actions from the user. References to timing (e.g., ""a couple of weeks ago"") relate to the friend's comment, not the user's state. The user expresses ongoing distress but no urgency about suicide.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned by the user. The focus is on emotional hurt and relationship conflict, not planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The user describes no past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""I ended up trying to make a joke of it"" refers to handling the conversation, not a suicide-related action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide or death wishes from the user themselves (only reported speech from the friend). Therefore, based on the rules:  
     - No explicit suicide/death wishes → INDICATOR.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Suicide risk corresponds only to the user, not others mentioned.  
     - When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION only if the user explicitly mentions suicide; here, they do not.  
   - The post expresses distress, hopelessness (e.g., feeling hurt, viewing the friend differently), and life problems (mental illness, relationship issues) without explicit suicidal content from the user.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent with phrases like ""jump out"" (implying jumping from a height to end life) and the context of distress (""please please please help me""). This constitutes an explicit expression of wanting to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Words like ""right now"" and ""im about to"" indicate immediate, current intent, suggesting the situation is unfolding in real-time.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods are described: using scissors to ""cut the screen"" and then ""jump out."" The location (""at my window"") is specified, and preparations are evident (holding scissors, positioned at the window).

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts. The focus is on imminent action (""about to""), not completed past events.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from step 1).  
   - A specific plan/method is identified (from step 3), so this cannot be IDEATION.  
   - Since the action is described as imminent but not yet completed (e.g., ""about to"" indicates intent, not past action), this aligns with BEHAVIOR under the rules (interrupted or initiated actions count as BEHAVIOR).  
   - It does not meet ATTEMPT criteria, as no past completed action is described.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide/death (e.g., ""jump out"") triggers IDEATION or higher; the method/plan elevates it to BEHAVIOR.  
- ""About to"" indicates initiated but not completed action, falling under BEHAVIOR per interrupted attempts rule.  
- No doubt between categories: BEHAVIOR is clear due to plan/method.

72,i'm gonna overdose on iron pills. i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it. i'm sorry,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""i'm gonna overdose on iron pills,"" which indicates a method of suicide (overdosing) and implies a desire to end life. Phrases like ""overdose"" directly relate to suicide or death wishes, especially in the context of not wanting to deal with pain (""i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it""). This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""i'm gonna"" suggests immediate or future intent, indicating a current plan to act. However, no specific timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is provided.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is clearly stated: ""overdose on iron pills."" This falls under ""specific methods (pills)"" as defined in the BEHAVIOR category. There is no mention of preparations, locations, or research, but the method itself is sufficient.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The post focuses on future intent (""gonna""), not past events.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (overdosing implies wanting to die).  
   - A specific plan/method (iron pills) is mentioned.  
   - According to the framework, this combination (explicit thoughts + plan/method) classifies as BEHAVIOR.  
   - It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.  
   - Critical Rule 5 applies: Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to the method mention.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including:  
   - ""im going to kill myself one day"" (direct reference to suicide)  
   - ""i feel like a failure who might as well die"" (explicit expression of wanting to die)  
   - ""i just want to run away to a forest and fucking die"" (explicit death wish)  
   These phrases clearly indicate suicidal thoughts, even if not immediate.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""im going to kill myself one day"" uses ""one day,"" indicating a general/future-oriented timeframe without immediacy (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now"").  
   - Other expressions like ""i just want to disappear"" and ""might as well die"" reflect ongoing distress but no current or imminent intent.  
   - Timing is general/ongoing, not urgent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging) are mentioned.  
   - The desire to ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" is vague and lacks concrete details about how death would occur, specific locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).  
   - No evidence of research or seeking information about methods.  
   - Thus, no plan or method is present.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no statements like ""I tried to"" or actions taken).  
   - No mention of interrupted attempts or self-harm behaviors.  
   - The post focuses on feelings and hypothetical desires, not completed actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself,"" ""die""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Since there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations, it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past suicide attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die or commit suicide without specific plans or methods.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit mentions like ""kill myself"" trigger IDEATION even if not immediate.  
     - No method or plan means IDEATION over BEHAVIOR.  
     - Doubt resolution: Explicit death wishes favor IDEATION over INDICATOR.

I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as:  
     - ""I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself""  
     - ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me""  
     - ""if only assisted suicide could be approved""  
     - ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered""  
     - ""to just end it all""  
     - ""how much I want to die""  
   - These phrases clearly express a desire to die or end life, meeting the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post describes ongoing, general distress rather than immediate plans:  
     - ""every single day is the same thing over and over""  
     - ""every night"" (referring to walking through sketchy areas hoping for murder)  
     - ""crying myself to sleep"" and ""each day""  
   - No words indicating imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") are present; the timing is persistent but not urgent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The person expresses a wish for death through external means (e.g., murder or assisted suicide) but does not describe any specific self-initiated plan, method, or preparation.  
   - Examples:  
     - Hoping for murder: ""I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me"" and ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night.""  
     - Mentioning assisted suicide: ""if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people.""  
   - However, there is no indication of the person researching, preparing, or intending to carry out a specific suicide method themselves (e.g., pills, jumping, or acquiring means). Walking through sketchy areas is a passive hope for external harm, not an active suicide plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The person explicitly states they lack the bravery to act: ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself.""  
   - References to life decisions (""redo the decisions I had made"") are about general life problems, not suicide actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation for self-initiated suicide is described. Wishing for murder or assisted suicide does not constitute a personal suicide plan under the framework.  
   - Therefore, based on the rules:  
     - Explicit thoughts without a plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit mentions like ""want to die"" qualify as IDEATION even if the person says they don't want to act (intrusive thoughts rule).  
     - When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR only if a method is mentioned—here, no self-initiated method exists.  
     - No past attempts are described, so not ATTEMPT.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses clear suicidal ideation without evidence of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Thus, it fits the IDEATION category.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post includes phrases expressing a desire to escape existence: ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""everyone would say they’d miss me"" (implying absence through death), and ""starting to want to wave the white flag"" (metaphor for surrender/suicidal surrender). These are explicit expressions of not wanting to live.  
   
2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of specific methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research. The post discusses failed treatments and coping mechanisms, not suicide plans.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - References past attempts to cope (""I’ve tried every way to cope,"" ""every antidepressant"") but no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm with suicidal intent.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit death wishes are present (""don’t wanna be here,"" ""wave the white flag""), meeting IDEATION criteria. No plan/method/preparation details, ruling out BEHAVIOR. No past suicide attempts described, ruling out ATTEMPT. Distress alone would be INDICATOR, but explicit death wishes elevate to IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Don’t wanna be here"" is explicit under framework guidelines (similar to ""don’t want to survive"").  
- No ambiguity: IDEATION trumps INDICATOR when death wishes are explicit.

78,"I really, really wish lives were donate-able. Today, I met a guy on the internet of the same age as me. I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago, he lost his mother to cancer, got bullied, got kicked out of school because of a false accusation which stated that he was planning a rebellion and how they were making a very small amount of money. The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life. I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother, so he could live the life he deserves. I don't deserve, nor want to live. But he does. I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - The post contains explicit expressions of not wanting to live: ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" This directly indicates a wish to cease existing.  
   - Additional context (""wish I could donate my life"") reinforces the desire to transfer life away from oneself.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - No immediate time references (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The phrasing (""I don't want to live"") reflects an ongoing/current state but lacks urgency.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No mention of methods, locations, preparations, or research. The ""donate life"" concept is metaphorical, not a concrete suicide plan.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - No description of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions by the author. References to another person's history are irrelevant per rules.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit death wish (""don't want to live"") is present → IDEATION category.  
   - Absence of plans/methods rules out BEHAVIOR. No past attempt by the author rules out ATTEMPT.  

**Critical Rules Applied**:  
   - ""I don't want to live"" is an explicit death wish (Rule 1).  
   - Focus solely on the author’s statements (Rule 1).  
   - No ambiguity with higher categories (Rule 5).

79,"I'm ready to die. I got into a physical altercation today and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of working on healing because it's a fucking joke. Family is a fucking joke. I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds. I'm quitting therapy. Talk about a waste of time and energy. Fuck weight loss. Soda and junk will kill me faster. Hope it all ends soon. Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes: ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon."" These are direct statements indicating a desire for death. Phrases like ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" and ""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid"" also imply a passive hope for death, but the key explicit phrases meet the criteria for suicide-related content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post uses current/immediate language: ""today"" (e.g., ""I'm stopping all my meds today"") and ""soon"" (e.g., ""Hope it all ends soon""). This indicates present distress and immediate actions, not past events or general feelings.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post describes specific preparations and methods: Stopping medications (antidepressants, anti-anxiety, blood pressure meds) is a life-threatening action that could hasten death, and it is framed as intentional (""Soda and junk will kill me faster""). Quitting therapy and engaging in unhealthy behaviors are also self-destructive preparations. While not a traditional suicide method like pills or jumping, these actions align with ""describing preparations"" under the BEHAVIOR category.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., no mention of ""I tried to"" or specific past actions with intent to die). The physical altercation mentioned is not a suicide-related action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm ready to die"", ""Hope it all ends soon""), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - There is also evidence of specific methods/preparations (stopping meds, unhealthy habits), so it is not IDEATION.  
   - No past completed suicide attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit ideation AND plan/method (stopping meds as preparation), it meets BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - Per critical rules: Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if any method/plan is mentioned.

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** 
   - The post includes phrases like ""I just want to disappear"" and ""I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain."" 
   - ""Want to disappear"" is analogous to ""want to be gone,"" which is explicitly listed in the framework as an expression of death wishes. Similarly, ""free from all this pain"" in a distressed context implies a desire to escape life, aligning with explicit expressions of not wanting to be alive or wanting to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** 
   - There are no immediate time indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past event references. The language is general and ongoing, expressing a persistent wish rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** 
   - No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on emotional distress without concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** 
   - No descriptions of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is about current feelings, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:** 
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (e.g., ""want to disappear"" as equivalent to ""want to be gone""), but there is no mention of plans, methods, or preparations. 
   - According to the rules: Explicit thoughts without a plan/method fall under IDEATION. 
   - Critical rules reinforce that phrases like ""want to be gone"" are explicit, and when in doubt between INDICATOR and IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen if any explicit death/suicide mention exists.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without any plan, method, or action, fitting the IDEATION category.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" in ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" and ""suicide"" in ""I just need a plan for suicide"". This confirms clear expressions of suicide and death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrasing ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" suggests a current contemplation, but there are no specific time indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"". The ""Ps"" addition (""I just need a plan for suicide"") indicates an ongoing desire to plan, but no immediate urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The key phrase ""I just need a plan for suicide"" explicitly references the need for a suicide plan. While no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location is mentioned, seeking or preparing a plan falls under ""preparations"" or ""research about suicide methods"" as defined in the BEHAVIOR category.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I did""). The focus is on current thoughts and planning.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill myself"" and ""suicide""), ruling out INDICATOR.  
   - The mention of needing a ""plan"" constitutes preparation, so this is not solely IDEATION (which requires no plan/method).  
   - With explicit thoughts AND a reference to planning, it meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Critical rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if ANY plan/method is mentioned (here, ""plan"" is explicitly stated).

82,"I need to find someone who relates. Does anyone else find themselves almost uncontrollably saying ""I'm going to kill myself""? I say other things like ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (relating to my most recent failed attempt) and ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"". It's almost like Tourettes but I know it's not. I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including: ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (referencing a past attempt), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly,"" and ""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out."" These phrases directly reference suicide, self-harm, and death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language indicates ongoing behavior: ""almost uncontrollably saying,"" ""find myself,"" and ""most recent failed attempt"" suggest recurring thoughts and actions rather than immediate timing. The phrase ""most recent"" implies a past event.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods are implied or described: ""blow my brains out"" with a finger gun gesture simulates a firearm method, and ""hurt myself really badly"" suggests self-harm. However, these are framed as compulsive behaviors or intrusive thoughts, not active planning or preparation.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt: ""my most recent failed attempt"" (referenced with ""I wish I stayed in the car""). This confirms a completed action with intent to die, regardless of outcome. The finger gun gesture is a current simulation but not an actual attempt or interrupted action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself""), but the key factor is the description of a past completed suicide attempt (""failed attempt""). According to the classification rules: ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT."" Even though current ideation and behavioral simulations (e.g., finger gun gesture) are mentioned, the past attempt takes precedence per the rule: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- The ""failed attempt"" is a completed past action, making ATTEMPT the correct category.  
- Between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT: ATTEMPT is chosen because a past attempt is described.  
- The suicide risk focuses solely on the author, not others.

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases found: ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal."" These directly express death wishes and suicidal intent.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). Describes ongoing distress (""I've been abused my entire life,"" ""people are mean toward me"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - References past abuse/bullying but no description of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""don't want to live,"" ""suicidal"").  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations → **IDEATION** per rules.  
   - Critical Rule #2 applies: ""Suicidal"" is an explicit mention, even without stated intent to act.  
   - Critical Rule #5a: Explicit mention overrides distress-only indicators.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day..."" – directly mentioning suicide via ""kill myself"" and expressing a desire to die to escape suffering.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""kill myself now"" uses ""now,"" indicating immediate urgency. The context (""another day of this torment"") reinforces current distress.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparation, or research is mentioned. The suicide reference is general.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The focus is on current feelings and hypothetical action (""I'd rather"").

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""kill myself"") are present → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Confirms IDEATION (per rules: explicit death wish without method = IDEATION).  
   - No past attempt described → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - Urgency (""now"") doesn't elevate to BEHAVIOR without method/plan.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Kill myself"" is explicit suicide content (Rule 1).  
- No method → IDEATION even with urgency (Rule 5: IDEATION/BEHAVIOR boundary).  
- Focus is on current desire, not past action (Rule 4).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I want to kill myself"" and ""urge to just blow my brains out."" This directly references suicide and death wishes.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The user describes ongoing urges (""every single day,"" ""thoughts rush through my head at night"") but no immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A method (""blow my brains out"" – implying firearms) is mentioned, but there is **no** description of preparations (e.g., owning a gun, loading it) or location. The user explicitly states they cannot act on the urge (""too much of a pussy to pull the trigger,"" ""can never bring myself to actually do it"").  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No past attempts are described (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried to shoot myself"").  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to kill myself,"" ""urge to blow my brains out"").  
   - A method is referenced but **without** specific plans, preparations, or actionable steps.  
   - Classification falls under **IDEATION** (explicit desire + no actionable plan/preparation).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Blow my brains out"" references a method but lacks concrete plans/preparations → does not escalate to BEHAVIOR.  
- Reluctance to act (""scared,"" ""can’t bring myself to do it"") doesn’t negate explicit ideation.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die, such as ""kill me,"" ""murder me,"" and ""end my horrible life."" These phrases directly indicate a desire for death, falling under the framework's definition of suicide-related content (e.g., ""ending life,"" ""wanting to die"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language shows immediacy through pleas like ""please come here"" and ""i beg of you,"" and the offer to ""dm the address"" suggests a current desire for action, indicating present urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post specifies a method—being murdered—and includes preparation by offering to share their address via DM. This constitutes a specific plan and setup, aligning with the BEHAVIOR category (e.g., ""seeking information about suicide methods"" or ""describing preparations"").

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm; the content focuses on current intentions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present, and a specific method/preparation is mentioned (murder via address sharing). According to the rules, this combination qualifies as BEHAVIOR. The critical rules confirm: 
   - Explicit content is present, so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - A plan/method is specified, so it exceeds IDEATION.
   - No past attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.
   - The ""when in doubt"" rule for IDEATION/BEHAVIOR applies: choose BEHAVIOR if any method/plan is mentioned.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city.

But I don't see a way out, and I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post describes significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being trapped (e.g., ""I feel like I wasn't allowed a normal childhood,"" ""I don't see a way out"").  
   - Key phrases: ""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time"" and ""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore"" suggest passive acceptance of death or a desire for relief, but there is NO explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, killing oneself, or ending life. The statement ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" explicitly rules out intent to act on suicidal thoughts.  
   - Conclusion: No explicit suicide or death wishes are present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post references ongoing feelings (e.g., ""I often feel,"" ""I have a feeling of dread"") but lacks any immediate or urgent indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"" related to suicide. The distress is contextualized around recent job issues and long-term life struggles, with no time-bound suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The content focuses on life circumstances (job loss, family issues) without any reference to planning or means for suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses past life events (e.g., upbringing, job changes) but no actions related to suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (only implicit hopelessness), the classification defaults to INDICATOR under the framework rules.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit vs. Implicit: Phrases like ""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore"" are implicit expressions of distress but not explicit suicide content (e.g., compared to ""I want to die"").  
     - When in doubt: Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, choose IDEATION only if explicit suicide mention exists—here, none is present.  
   - The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction without crossing into explicit suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" multiple times: ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" and ""i still thought about suicide."" This is a direct reference to suicide or death wishes, satisfying the criterion for explicit content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post describes current distress (""today is the anniversary,"" ""now it's like i'm back to square one"") and ongoing suicidal thoughts (""get stronger and stronger,"" ""still thought about suicide""). However, there are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"" for acting on thoughts, and no past actions or attempts are described—only thoughts and feelings.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., writing notes), or research. Phrases like ""i just want to collapse and let go"" are vague and do not indicate a concrete plan or method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post does not describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. It focuses solely on thoughts and emotional states, with no references to actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (via ""suicidal thoughts""), but there is no evidence of a plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. Therefore, based on the rules:  
     - Explicit suicide thoughts + NO plan/method → **IDEATION**.

### Critical Rules Application:
- **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Suicidal thoughts"" is explicit, so it cannot be INDICATOR.
- **Intrusive Thoughts:** The mention of suicidal thoughts, even with ambivalence (""i thought that maybe i can power through""), still qualifies as IDEATION.
- **Interrupted Actions:** None described.
- **Past vs. Present:** Only current thoughts are discussed; no past attempts.
- **When in Doubt:**  
  - Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Explicit suicide mention → IDEATION.  
  - No BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT elements, so no escalation needed.
- **Focus on Writer:** All content refers to the author's own experiences.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I am planning to kill myself tonight,"" which includes direct references to suicide (""kill myself"") and death wishes (""Rest In Peace""). This satisfies the criterion for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""tonight"" indicates immediate timing and urgency, suggesting the action is planned for the very near future. The context (""Everyone who could help me is asleep now"") reinforces a sense of current opportunity to act.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post states ""I am planning to kill myself tonight,"" but does not specify any details about the method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location. There is no mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) or research. The word ""planning"" implies intent but lacks concrete specifics about how the suicide will be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post focuses on future intent (""planning to kill myself tonight"") and does not describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. All references are to planned actions, not completed ones.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There is no specific plan or method described (e.g., no details on how, where, or preparations), so it does not meet the full criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - The post describes current/future intent, not a past completed action, so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - Applying the critical rules:  
     - Rule 1 confirms ""I am planning to kill myself"" is an explicit expression.  
     - Rule 5 (doubt resolution): Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR only if ANY method/plan is mentioned. Here, ""planning"" is stated, but it lacks specificity (no method, location, or preparation details), so it aligns more closely with IDEATION (explicit thoughts without plan/method).  
     - However, Rule 5 specifies that for IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan is mentioned. Since ""planning"" is explicitly mentioned, this could lean toward BEHAVIOR. But upon closer inspection, the framework defines BEHAVIOR as requiring specific details (e.g., methods, locations, preparations), which are absent. The IDEATION examples include phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" without method, which is similar to this post's ""I am planning to kill myself"" in terms of vagueness. Thus, based on the lack of specifics, it is IDEATION.  
     - Final decision: Explicit suicide thoughts are present, but without a specific plan or method, this is IDEATION.

91,"I've been practicing hanging myself and I can't wait for the day when I finally do it. My life is fucked now. There's no turning it around. I'm just worthless trash who deserves to die. No one is going to convince me otherwise. But yeah I practiced and there was no pain really. I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed. The thought makes me so happy. Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy. I take great solace knowing that this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon. I'm saying this on reddit because if I were to share this with people in real life they'd try to stop me and I don't want anyone to take this away from me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""practicing hanging myself,"" ""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""deserves to die,"" ""Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy,"" and ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon."" These phrases clearly express a desire to end life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language indicates future-oriented planning (""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""I'm going to keep practicing,"" ""I will succeed""), but no immediate timeframes like ""today"" or ""now."" The focus is on ongoing preparation rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is mentioned: ""hanging myself."" There is also detailed preparation described, such as ""practicing hanging myself,"" ""I'm going to keep practicing,"" and ""train myself to break this natural survival instinct."" This shows active engagement in developing the means and readiness for suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes past actions: ""I've been practicing hanging myself"" and ""I practiced and there was no pain really."" This constitutes an interrupted or preparatory action (simulating hanging to overcome instincts), not a completed suicide attempt with intent to die. It aligns with the definition of behavior due to the initiation of action without completion.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present, so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific method (hanging) and preparations (practicing) are mentioned, so it exceeds IDEATION.  
   - The actions described are preparatory and interrupted (practicing hanging), not a completed past attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, this fits BEHAVIOR: explicit suicidal thoughts with specific plans, methods, and preparations.

92,"Snapped at my dog. I know i'm a piece of shit. My dog is 14. She always barks and growls at me if i walk by when someone else is eating. My family always says its because she sees me as 'weak' because i was scared of dogs when we first got her. That makes me feel like absolute shit and its all i can think of every time this happens. Tonight it happened twice. the first time i screamed at her to shut up and the second time i screamed i would kill her and whipped a blanket at her. My mom was there and she said i scared her. I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about. I dont want to get into any relationships (not that i would anyway) because i can snap like this. I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them, to a clueless little dog. I want to die. I want to disappear. I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I want to die"" and ""I want to disappear"" (synonym for death wish).  
   - Additional phrases: ""take myself away from here so I can't hurt anyone"" implies self-removal via death.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Imminent timing: ""if not tonight"" suggests current/urgent risk.  
   - General/ongoing: ""one day I will"" indicates persistent intent.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (pills, weapons, etc.), locations, or preparations described.  
   - ""Take myself away"" is vague and lacks concrete planning details.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes (""want to die,"" ""disappear"") are present → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation described → Rules out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of past suicide actions → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - Classification aligns with IDEATION (explicit suicidal thoughts without plans).

Everything started with second lockdown  in my country in october. I couldn't see my friends for a long time. Studying through MS Teams was draining me. I had some anxiety attacks aswell. I don't have any purpose in life to be honest. I don't know what will i do after college. I feel like disapointment. That's all. I just needed to vent. Sorry for my english.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post includes the phrase ""I just don't want to exist,"" which is an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive, similar to ""I don't want to be alive"" as defined in the IDEATION category.  
   - The person denies being suicidal (""Im not suicidal or something"") and mentions suicide in a general context (""I think that suicide is selfish""), but the explicit personal expression ""don't want to exist"" still qualifies as a death wish under the rules. Critical Rule 2 states that even with denial or intrusive thoughts, explicit mentions of death/suicide count.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No current/immediate indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The distress is described as ongoing (""for almost a week,"" ""everything started with second lockdown"") with no specific timing for suicidal action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of specific methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I just don't want to exist""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned.  
   - According to the logic: Explicit suicide thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Critical Rule 5 (when in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION) directs choosing IDEATION for any explicit death/suicide mention.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."". (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness. For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as: ""I dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""taking my life,"" ""the thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating,"" ""I want to take my life,"" and self-identification as suicidal (""why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal""). There is also a direct reference to a suicide attempt: ""I attempted suicide last week"" and ""my attempt had failed."" These phrases clearly indicate explicit expressions of suicide and death-related thoughts.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post includes past timing indicators: ""I attempted suicide last week"" specifies a concrete past event. There are general/ongoing expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to take my life""), but no current/immediate indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"" for future actions. The focus is on the past attempt and ongoing hopelessness.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - For the past attempt, the post mentions preparations: drafting a suicide note (""I drafted my note"") and deciding against it (""not to leave the note""). However, no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is described for the attempt. For current thoughts, there is no mention of specific plans, methods, or preparations for future actions; it is more reflective (e.g., ""I want to take my life"" without details).

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post explicitly describes a past completed suicide attempt: ""I attempted suicide last week"" and ""my attempt had failed."" This is a concrete action taken with intent to die, regardless of the outcome. The mention of drafting a note supports this as part of the attempt's context.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - There is explicit suicide content, ruling out INDICATOR.  
   - The presence of a described past suicide attempt (completed action) directly maps to the ATTEMPT category, per the rules: ""If describes past suicide attempt → ATTEMPT.""  
   - Even though there are current suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to take my life""), the rule states: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""  
   - This is not BEHAVIOR because BEHAVIOR is for plans/preparations for future actions or interrupted attempts, but here the attempt was completed (though failed) and in the past.  
   - Therefore, based on the critical rules, ATTEMPT is the appropriate classification.

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill you"" in the context of asking about a lethal dose of valium, which directly references suicide or death. The phrase ""I just want this nightmare to end"" expresses a desire for escape that, in this suicidal context, reinforces death wishes. This meets the threshold for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" indicates current or recent action (taking valium), suggesting immediacy. However, there are no explicit timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" so the focus is on the ongoing behavior rather than past events.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method (valium overdose) is mentioned, and the question ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"" constitutes seeking information about suicide methods. Additionally, ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" implies preparation and partial action (having ingested some valium), which aligns with behavioral indicators.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The statement about taking valium but fearing it wasn't enough describes an interrupted or incomplete action (ingesting pills without confirmed lethality). This is not a completed past attempt, as there is no description of a full action with intent that resulted in an outcome (e.g., hospitalization).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (death wishes via ""kill you"" and ""want this nightmare to end"").  
   - A specific plan/method (valium) and preparation (taking some pills) are also present.  
   - This fits the BEHAVIOR category, as it involves suicidal ideation with method details and initiated action, but not a completed past attempt. The ""when in doubt"" rule supports this: between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to the method mention; between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT, it is not ATTEMPT because the action was interrupted or ongoing, not completed.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide attempts,"" ""suicide note,"" and descriptions of intentional self-harm actions (overdosing on sleeping pills, cutting neck with razor, prescription drug cocktail).  
   - Death/suicide references are unambiguous (e.g., ""swallowed every single one"" of pills, ""sliced... across my neck"").  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Describes **past events**: ""when I was 16,"" ""November 2020,"" ""the first attempt."" No current/immediate plans or urges mentioned.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods detailed: buying/unisom pills overdose, razor to neck, prescription drug cocktail.  
   - Preparations: writing a suicide note, acquiring pills/weapons.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - **Past completed attempts**:  
     - Overdose at 16: Swallowed bottles of pills (hospitalized).  
     - Razor cut to neck (November 2020).  
     - Prescription drug cocktail (November 2020).  
   - Motorcycle incident is **not** framed as intentional self-harm (""didn't have to do with suicide"").  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content + descriptions of **completed past actions** with intent to die (regardless of survival) → **ATTEMPT**.  
   - Rules applied:  
     - Past attempts dominate classification (Critical Rule 4).  
     - ""Attempt"" requires concrete past actions (Critical Rule 5).  
     - Motorcycle incident is irrelevant to classification (accidental, not suicidal).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" which are direct references to suicidal thoughts or death wishes. Phrases like ""too scared to kill myself"" and ""suicide is illegal here"" clearly indicate the person is thinking about suicide, even with reluctance.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") are present. The post discusses a hypothetical scenario (""if I fail"") and general feelings of being ""too tired of life,"" suggesting ongoing distress rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location is mentioned. The reference to illegality and consequences of failing (""get arrested or fined"") is a barrier or fear, not a description of preparations, research, or a concrete plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""if I fail"" is conditional and hypothetical, not an account of a completed or initiated action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself,"" ""suicide""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. The person's fear (""too scared"") and focus on consequences do not constitute a plan or behavior. According to the rules, explicit mentions of suicide with no method/plan fall under IDEATION, even with expressions of reluctance (e.g., ""too scared to kill myself"" aligns with intrusive thoughts still being IDEATION). There is no evidence of BEHAVIOR (no plan) or ATTEMPT (no past action).

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide/death overrides INDICATOR classification.  
- No plan/method means it cannot be BEHAVIOR.  
- Hypothetical ""if I fail"" does not indicate a past ATTEMPT.  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Specific future timing: ""I'm taking a trip in April"" indicates a planned timeframe (April) for the action.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Preparation: ""taking a trip"" implies premeditated action (traveling to execute suicide).  
   - Contextual method: Though not explicitly named, ""end this bullshit for good"" coupled with ""trip"" suggests a deliberate plan (e.g., traveling to a secluded location).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions related to death or suicide. Specifically, the phrase ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"" includes ""od on meds"" (overdose on medications), which is a direct reference to a suicide method. The wish to ""get hit by a car"" also implies a desire for death in the context of distress. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide/death content, as per the framework (e.g., ""wanting to die"" or methods like ""pills"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language expresses a current, general desire (""i just wish"") rather than immediate or time-specific plans (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). The tone is ongoing and hopeless, but not urgent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific suicide method is mentioned: ""od on meds"" (overdose on medications). This qualifies as a plan/method under the BEHAVIOR category, as it references a concrete means (pills/overdose). No preparations, locations, or research are described.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current feelings and wishes, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (via the wish to die by overdose or accident).  
   - A specific method (""od on meds"") is mentioned, so this goes beyond IDEATION.  
   - No past attempt is described, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR,"" the classification is BEHAVIOR.  
   - Critical rule applied: Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because a method is mentioned.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** 
   - The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body,"" ""being unwanted,"" ""I would give absolutely everything... to have been born that way""). 
   - However, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive. Phrases like ""jump out of bed"" are metaphorical (referring to enthusiasm if attractive) and not related to suicide. 
   - No equivalent phrases like ""going to die"" or ""want to be gone"" are present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** 
   - No immediate or urgent terms (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""going to"" in a suicidal context). 
   - No past events related to suicide attempts or self-harm. 
   - General/ongoing distress is described (e.g., ""daily torture""), but not tied to suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** 
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping as self-harm), locations, preparations, or research mentioned. The word ""jump"" is used figuratively.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** 
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:** 
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide or death wish mentioned, the classification defaults to INDICATOR. 
   - The content fits INDICATOR: expressing severe distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal ideation.

**Critical Rules Application:** 
- Explicit vs. Implicit: Distress is implicit but not explicitly suicidal; metaphorical language (""jump out of bed"") is not a death wish. 
- When in doubt: Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, choose INDICATOR as there is no explicit suicide mention.

102,'Just a phase'. Was told that me being suicidal is 'just a phase' because of my age despite me being abused and severely mentally ill. I've tried to kill myself 8 times. I'm tired of people's ignorance,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""me being suicidal"" and ""tried to kill myself,"" which directly references suicide and death wishes.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" indicates past actions (""tried""), with no current/immediate timing markers (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned in relation to current suicidal thoughts.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post explicitly describes past completed actions: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" (actual attempts with intent to die).  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (""suicidal,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - No current plan/method is described, but past attempts are explicitly stated.  
   - **Classification Rule**: Past completed suicide attempts (regardless of outcome) warrant classification as **ATTEMPT**.  
   - Critical Rule #4: Past actions take precedence over current ideation/plans.  
   - Critical Rule #5: ""ATTEMPT"" supersedes other categories when past actions are described.

103,bruh. they always say if something/someone makes you sad then you're better off without them right? but when i say i'm better off dead everyone's like no don't do that :D,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""i'm better off dead,"" which directly expresses a wish to be dead or not be alive. This is similar to phrases like ""want to be gone"" or ""don't want to survive,"" as outlined in the framework. Even though it's presented with irony ("":D""), the explicit reference to death in a context of distress (e.g., discussing sadness and others' reactions) qualifies it as a suicide-related expression.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post uses ""when I say,"" indicating a general or recurring pattern of expression rather than immediate intent (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). The word ""always"" suggests an ongoing, habitual thought, not a current crisis.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of any specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging), location (e.g., bridge), preparation (e.g., writing a note), or research. The content focuses solely on expressing a wish, not on planning or acting.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors (e.g., no references to ""I tried"" or actions like cutting). The post only discusses verbal expressions (""when I say"").  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""better off dead""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation described, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - There is no description of a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicidal thoughts but no plan or method, it falls under IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The phrase ""better off dead"" is explicit per the framework, even with sarcasm.  
- No ambiguity between categories: IDEATION is clear due to explicit death wish without plans/actions.  
- Risk applies only to the author (not others), and the author references their own statements.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""overdose"" and describes taking 44 paracetamol. Phrases like ""could i survive an od like this"" directly reference a suicide method. ""I did this to myself"" confirms intentional self-harm.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The overdose occurred ""almost an hour ago,"" placing it in the recent past. Physical symptoms (stomach pain, sweating, shaking) indicate ongoing effects.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific method is stated (44 paracetamol overdose). Preparations are implied by the act of taking pills.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The user explicitly describes a completed action: ""i took 44 paracetamol."" This is a concrete past suicide attempt with clear intent, regardless of current ambivalence (""i dont think i want to die"").  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide method is mentioned (overdose) ✅  
   - Specific completed action occurred (ingesting pills) ✅  
   - This meets the **ATTEMPT** criteria: *""actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome""*.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Past completed action dominates classification (overrides current hesitation).  
- ""When in doubt"" rule: Completed action = ATTEMPT, not BEHAVIOR.

- **Suicide Content Identification:** The phrase ""I want to end it"" is an explicit expression of wanting to end one's life, as ""end it"" is a common euphemism for suicide or death wishes in contexts of distress. This meets the criteria for explicit mention.
- **Urgency and Timing Indicators:** No immediate or specific timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") is mentioned. The user expresses uncertainty about ""when,"" indicating a general desire rather than immediacy.
- **Plan/Method Assessment:** The user explicitly states having ""no idea how, when or anything else,"" confirming no specific plan, method, preparations, or research is described.
- **Action History:** No mention of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.
- **Decision Logic:** Explicit suicide thoughts (""want to end it"") are present, but there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned. According to the framework, this falls under IDEATION.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains expressions of distress, hopelessness, and emotional overload (e.g., ""I really can't handle it anymore,"" ""feels completely hopeless,"" ""I'm exhausted"").  
   - There is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (e.g., no phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" ""end my life,"" or similar). Terms like ""I feel nothing"" and ""overloading"" imply depression but not suicidal intent.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No indicators of immediate or past suicidal actions (e.g., no words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""tried,"" or references to specific timing related to suicide). The post discusses ongoing struggles (""vicious cycle of highs and lows"") but no urgency tied to self-harm.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, locations, or research (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, or specific actions).  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The line ""It's been a year since I last posted here"" refers to social media activity, not suicidal actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide/death wish mentioned, the classification defaults to INDICATOR based on the rule: ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR.""  
   - The post aligns with INDICATOR: it expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction (e.g., ""can't handle it anymore,"" ""completely hopeless"") without any suicidal ideation or behavior.  

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: All phrases are implicit distress (e.g., ""feels completely hopeless"" is not equivalent to explicit suicide intent).  
- When in Doubt: No ambiguity; no suicide content exists, so INDICATOR is clear.  
- Focus: Only the author's experiences are described.

That's great. i mean it does explain A FUCK TON in my life but it was hard to accept it at first. i'm in therapy again btw so it might get better for me. I have really bad bipolar tendencies tho so i'm a lot like my old abusive uncle except i could never hurt anyone physically, im very good at manipulation and it scares me sometimes bc ion wan be that person. other than feeling lonely and lost as ever and not knowing what to do wit my life i've been overall better compared to the rest of my life. i feel more like myself. starting to accept who i am wether i like who it is or not. i hope everyone is okay, if you aren't there's always a way to improve on something even if your at rock bottom. everyone has to hit that rock bottom to get better too, once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death. my rock bottom was having really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday for nearly 2 years. these last 2 years since i've been way better tho, weird to think so much has happened in 4 years but also so little. luv y'all please find a way to stay positive and stay safe. even if no one sees my posts this community will forever be the safest place bc i can vent and leave and if i regret a post delete it the next day",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post mentions ""death"" in the phrase ""nothing lower but death,"" but this is a general observation about rock bottom, not a personal expression of wanting to die. There are no explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""want to die."" Distress is evident (e.g., ""feeling lonely and lost,"" ""depression,"" ""bipolar mental breakdowns""), but no direct suicide/death wishes are expressed.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate timing words (""tonight,"" ""now""). References to time are retrospective (""last 2 years,"" ""4 years""). Current state is framed positively (""been way better,"" ""starting to accept who I am"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. Focus is on past struggles and current therapy/improvement.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Describes past mental health crises (""depression/bipolar breakdowns,"" ""puking everyday"") but no references to suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. Phrases like ""almost being abusive"" relate to behavior toward others, not self-directed harm.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - **NO explicit suicide/death wishes** → INDICATOR.  
   - Distress (loneliness, depression) and life challenges are present, but all suicidal content is absent. Hopeful elements (""therapy,"" ""getting better,"" ""stay positive"") reinforce this.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Death"" is contextual, not personal → Not explicit suicide content.  
- Past mental health struggles ≠ suicide attempt.  
- No ambiguity: Clear absence of suicide expressions.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide-related content: ""plan on ending it soon"" (where ""ending it"" is a common euphemism for suicide) and ""overdosing on ibuprofen"" (a method of suicide). Phrases like ""i dont know what else to do"" and ""i am overwhelmed by guilt"" indicate distress, but the key is the direct reference to ending life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Timing is uncertain but imminent: ""soon,"" ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon."" This shows consideration of near-future action, though not definitive. ""Pain scares me too much"" introduces hesitation, but doesn't negate the expressed plan.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""overdosing on ibuprofen,"" and it's identified as the ""go-to plan."" The person is also researching effectiveness and pain (""i dont know if overdosibg on ibuprofen is painful or would work""), which qualifies as method assessment.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The post focuses on current thoughts and plans.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""plan on ending it soon"").  
   - A specific plan/method is also present (ibuprofen overdose as the ""go-to plan"").  
   - According to the framework: Explicit thoughts + plan/method → BEHAVIOR.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - ""Ending it"" and ""overdosing"" are explicit, not implicit.  
     - The method mention triggers BEHAVIOR over IDEATION (as per ""when in doubt"" rule).  
     - No past attempt described, so not ATTEMPT.  
     - Interrupted actions aren't present; this is planning/research.

I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicide: ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself."" This includes the phrase ""kill myself,"" which directly references suicide and wanting to die, satisfying the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""I'd kill myself"" is conditional (""if I had a gun"") and lacks immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" However, it expresses a current desire tied to the present emotional state (""right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future""), indicating ongoing distress but not immediate action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is mentioned: using a gun (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself""). This qualifies as a specific suicide method under the BEHAVIOR category, even though it is hypothetical (the person does not indicate having access to a gun or making preparations).

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm related to suicide. The relapse described refers to addiction (extreme pornography), not a suicide attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific method (gun) is mentioned, so it cannot be IDEATION (which requires no method).  
   - No past completed suicide attempt is described, so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - Since there are explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method, it falls under BEHAVIOR according to the rules: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR"" and ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned.""  
   - The conditional nature (""if I had"") does not change the classification, as BEHAVIOR includes mentioning specific methods regardless of current access or preparation.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit mention of suicide: ""i just wanna kill myself"" – clear expression of suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   ""i just wanna kill myself"" implies a current/ongoing desire but lacks immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). No past attempts described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparations, or research mentioned. The phrase ""kill myself"" is general.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. Focus is on thoughts and distress.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thought (""kill myself"") is present → rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → IDEATION (per rules: explicit thoughts without method = IDEATION).  
   - Critical Rule 2 applies: Explicit suicide mention (even without intent to act) requires IDEATION.  
   - Critical Rule 5: No ambiguity with BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT since no actions or plans exist.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""move on from this worthless existence,"" which directly reference suicide and death wishes. This satisfies the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The user states ""I plan on doing it next week,"" indicating a specific future timeframe (""next week"") rather than immediate action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). There are no past events or general/ongoing indicators related to suicide actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The user explicitly mentions having ""a suicide plan"" and says, ""I've finally got a plan on how I can kill myself,"" confirming the existence of a plan. While the specific method isn't detailed, the statement implies a method is part of the plan (e.g., ""I'm pretty sure this will work""). This aligns with the BEHAVIOR category, which includes mentioning plans or preparations, even if not fully specified.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. Phrases like ""I hope I don't get cold feet"" refer to future intent, not completed actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill myself"").  
   - A plan is mentioned (""suicide plan,"" ""how I can kill myself""), so this cannot be IDEATION.  
   - Since the plan is for the future (""next week"") and no past attempt is described, it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - Based on the rules: Any mention of a plan/method qualifies as BEHAVIOR, even if not detailed. Critical Classification Rule 5 states: ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned.""  
   - Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""attempted suicide in the past."" Phrases like ""I have attempted suicide"" and ""begun having those thoughts again"" directly reference suicide/death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The recurrence of thoughts is framed as ongoing (""begun having those thoughts again""), but no current timeline for action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No current plans, methods, preparations, or research mentioned. Focus is on seeking help, not acting on thoughts.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Explicitly describes a past completed action: ""I have attempted suicide in the past."" This is a concrete historical event.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (IDEATION threshold met).  
   - Past completed suicide attempt stated (escalates to ATTEMPT per rules).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**

Self-harm is not equivalent to suicidal ideation unless tied to intent to die, which is absent here.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - Not applicable, as no suicide-related content is identified. The post describes ongoing struggles (e.g., ""it's getting to be too much"") but no immediate or past suicide timing cues like ""tonight"" or ""I tried.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - Not applicable. No suicide thoughts are present, so there can be no plan, method, or preparations discussed.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - The post references self-harm behavior (""I can't even cut"") but no past suicide attempts (e.g., no descriptions of actions like overdosing or hanging). Self-harm without suicidal intent does not constitute a suicide attempt.

   - The post contains explicit mentions of death: ""when I die"" and ""if I'm dead"". It also expresses a desire for death as relief from pain: ""my pain is finally over"" and ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."" This qualifies as explicit expressions of death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - There are no immediate timing words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""today."" The phrasing ""when I die"" is general and not tied to a specific timeframe. No past events or attempts are mentioned.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are described. The focus is on the wish for death, not how it would be achieved.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No references to past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The language is future-oriented (""when I die"") rather than recounting completed actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""die"" and ""dead""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and phrases like ""I don't want to live"" and ""goodbye,"" which directly express a desire to die or end one's life. This meets the criterion for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Words like ""finally decided"" and ""goodbye"" suggest current intent, but there are no specific time indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The tone implies immediacy, but no urgent timing is specified.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The phrase ""take the leap"" is metaphorical and could imply a method like jumping, but it is not a specific, concrete plan or method (e.g., no details on location, means, or preparations). There is no mention of research, acquiring tools, or other actionable steps.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post discusses current intentions (""decided to"") and future actions, with no reference to past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is described, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - There is no description of a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan/method, it falls under IDEATION.

   - Explicit phrases: ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" ""it's finally ending,"" ""22 years on this earth was enough,"" and ""Goodbye"" indicate clear expressions of wanting to die or end life.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""One last time before I end it all"" and ""before I call it quits"" suggest imminent timing (after playing the game).  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location mentioned.  
   - No descriptions of preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) or research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - References past life experiences (""21 years enjoyable,"" ""last 1 year bad"") but **no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions**.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide wishes present (""end it all,"" ""call it quits"").  
   - **No plan/method/preparation described** → Falls under IDEATION.  
   - Urgency (""one last time"") doesn't imply a method, only timing intent.  
   - Critical rule: Explicit suicide thoughts without method = IDEATION.

117,I need help. So I met this person on reddit who I am sort of friends with. But She wrote three days ago that she had tried to kill herself and she is now on restrictions at home. She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post describes the author expressing distress (""I need help,"" ""I'm scared"") and concern about a friend who reportedly attempted suicide. However, there is no explicit mention of the author themselves wanting to die, commit suicide, or expressing any death wishes. The suicidal content is attributed solely to the friend, not the author.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The author's language (""now,"" ""pls tell me how"") indicates current distress and urgency about their friend's well-being, but this does not relate to any personal suicidal intent or timing for the author.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The author does not mention any personal plans, methods, preparations, or research related to suicide. All references to methods or actions (e.g., ""tried to kill herself"") are about the friend.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The author does not describe any past suicide attempts, self-harm, or related actions for themselves. The only action history mentioned is the friend's attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die by the author themselves, the classification falls under INDICATOR. The author expresses distress and life problems (fear for their friend's safety), but without any suicidal content for the person writing the post.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- The suicide risk classification must focus only on the person writing the post (the author), not other people mentioned.  
- No explicit suicidal content from the author → INDICATOR.  
- Distress without suicide mention fits the INDICATOR category.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I will hang myself now,"" which directly refers to suicide and death wishes. Phrases like ""kill me"" and ""I don't want to be alone anymore"" in the context of distress further support this.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Words like ""now"" indicate current/immediate intent, emphasizing urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method (hanging) is described. Additionally, the person is actively preparing by ""looking for something that I can tie,"" which shows concrete steps toward carrying out the suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post mentions ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore,"" but this refers to past self-harm, not a suicide attempt. No past suicide attempts are described (e.g., no statements like ""I tried to hang myself"").

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I will hang myself now"").  
   - A specific method (hanging) and preparations (""looking for something that I can tie"") are mentioned, aligning with the BEHAVIOR category.  
   - No completed past suicide attempt is described, so it does not meet the ATTEMPT threshold.  
   - Based on the critical rules:  
     - Explicit mention of suicide with a plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.  
     - When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to the method and preparation details.

It feels like I am being ripped apart and put back together incorrectly. I can't stop shaking. How am I supposed to live like this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post mentions ""it's not even that I just want to die,"" which explicitly references death wishes but frames it as a negation (""not""). No other phrases about suicide, killing self, ending life, or being dead are present. The language focuses on misery and dysfunction.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate time indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past attempt references. The tone describes ongoing suffering (""I can barely function,"" ""how am I supposed to live like this?"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of methods, locations, preparations, or research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - The phrase ""want to die"" is explicitly negated (""not even that I just want to die""), so there is **no explicit suicide/death wish**. The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and dysfunction but lacks any explicit suicidal intent.  
   - Classification: **INDICATOR** (distress without explicit suicide mention).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Want to die"" is denied, so no IDEATION.  
- No methods/actions to escalate to BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT.  
- Follows ""when in doubt"" rule: No explicit suicide mention → INDICATOR.

I can't handle it and when I say something about it, they respond with: well, the works keep coming. yeah, it is not my fault they organized themselves like trash. I am a hard worker but now I just don't see the need. Tf is this life? I want out.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly states: ""I just want to kill myself."" This is a direct mention of suicide. Additionally, phrases like ""I want out now"" and ""I want out"" (in the context of distress and dissatisfaction with life) imply a desire to escape, reinforcing the explicit suicide reference.  
   - **Conclusion:** Explicit suicide content is present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""I want out now"" includes ""now,"" indicating current/immediate urgency. However, there are no specific time-bound indicators like ""tonight"" or ""today"" for a suicide plan, only a general expression of wanting to act soon.  
   - **Conclusion:** Urgency is present but not tied to a specific imminent plan.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post contains no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means), or research into methods. The focus is on the desire (""want to kill myself"") without concrete details on how or where.  
   - **Conclusion:** No plan, method, or preparation is indicated.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to overdose""), interrupted attempts (e.g., ""I put a noose around my neck but stopped""), or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses work-related stress and feelings but no actions related to suicide.  
   - **Conclusion:** No evidence of past suicide actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I just want to kill myself""), but there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, based on the rules:  
     - Explicit suicide thoughts + NO plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Additionally, applying critical rules:  
     - The explicit phrase ""I just want to kill myself"" qualifies as IDEATION per the framework, even if the person expresses frustration with life circumstances.  
     - No doubt between categories: The presence of explicit suicide content rules out INDICATOR, and the absence of a plan rules out BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.  
   - **Conclusion:** Classification is IDEATION.

121,"Are we going? AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE. It's the truth, you choose to not face the reality of the situation. You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames. Let the world know that you considered yourself normal, it is the world that wronged you and the world is wrong, not you. With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem and it's not even funny. Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also. Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes. Specifically, it states ""AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE"" (where ""DOIE"" is likely a typo for ""DIE""), and references ""suicidal thoughts"" directly (e.g., ""even the suicidal thoughts are a cope""). Phrases like ""want to do it"" (in context of suicide) and ""Go out with bang, and big flames"" further indicate explicit expressions of wanting to die or end life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - There are no clear indicators of immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") for suicidal action. The post discusses suicidal thoughts as an ongoing issue (""suicidal thoughts are a cope"") and uses conditional language like ""If you change your mind,"" which suggests contemplation rather than imminent action. Timing is general/ongoing.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post describes specific methods and preparations for suicide or destructive acts, such as ""make nitroglycerin at home,"" ""research where to find the parts,"" ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants,"" and using ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"" to ""produce mayhem."" However, these are framed as advice to ""you"" (the reader) and not explicitly stated as the writer's personal plan. The writer does not claim to be researching, preparing, or acting on these methods themselves.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions by the writer. The post states ""you will never do it,"" implying no history of action, and focuses on thoughts rather than completed behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""I WANT TO DOIE""), satisfying the criteria for suicide content.  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is attributed to the writer personally; the detailed methods are directed at ""you"" and are advisory.  
   - Therefore, based on the logic: Explicit suicide thoughts with no personal plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I WANT TO DOIE"" is an explicit death wish.  
     - Intrusive Thoughts: References to ""suicidal thoughts"" count as IDEATION even if framed as a ""cope.""  
     - When in Doubt: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, but no personal method/plan is claimed by the writer, so IDEATION is chosen.  
   - Focus on writer: Risk classification is based solely on the writer's expressions (""I"" statements for thoughts; ""you"" statements are not attributed to the writer's actions).

122,"Bully payback help. My best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesn't even know. Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. It's mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!. With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - The post quotes the bully saying ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself"" to the friend. However, this is a threat from a third party (the bully), not an expression of suicidal intent from the author or the friend. The author describes the friend as overwhelmed, tired, and not eating, but there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die from the friend or the author themselves.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - No current/immediate (e.g., ""tonight""), past (e.g., ""I tried""), or ongoing (e.g., ""always"") suicidal timing references from the friend or author. The distress described is contextual to bullying, not self-harm.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No mention of suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research by the friend or author. The bully’s threat (""go kill yourself"") is not adopted or echoed by the subject.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors by the friend or author.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide/death wish expressed by the person writing the post (or the friend as the subject of concern), this falls under **INDICATOR**. The post describes severe distress, hopelessness, and mental disturbance due to bullying, but without any suicidal expressions.  

**Critical Rules Application**:  
- The bully’s statement does NOT count as the friend’s/author’s expression (rules specify classification is for the person writing the post/subject, not others).  
- General distress without explicit suicide mentions = INDICATOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself"", ""suicide is on my mind"", ""I want to hang myself""  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Ongoing: ""suicide is on my mind everyday"", ""how much longer I could last""  
   - No immediate time markers (e.g., ""tonight"")  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: ""I want to hang myself"" (hanging)  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Mentions past outreach attempts but no suicide attempts (""I have tried to reach out"")  
   - No description of past self-harm/suicide actions  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts present (""kill myself"", ""suicide is on my mind"")  
   - Specific method identified (""hang myself"") → **BEHAVIOR**

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""still alive unfortunately,"" ""I attempted once again,"" and ""still want to attempt again."" These phrases directly reference suicide attempts and a current desire to die, meeting the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""last night I attempted once again"" indicates a past event (specifically, an action that occurred very recently). ""Still want to attempt again"" suggests an ongoing desire but lacks immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned for the current or future suicidal thoughts. The post only references past actions generally without detailing how the attempts were made.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post describes a concrete past action: ""last night I attempted once again,"" which is a completed suicide attempt (regardless of outcome). It also references multiple past attempts (""my 15th time""), confirming a history of actual suicide attempts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (ruling out INDICATOR).  
   - A past completed suicide attempt is described (""last night I attempted""), which directly qualifies for ATTEMPT according to the classification rules.  
   - Even though there is current ideation (""still want to attempt again""), the rules state that if past attempts are mentioned (especially as the primary focus), classify as ATTEMPT. No specific plan or method for the current desire elevates it to BEHAVIOR, so it remains ATTEMPT based on the described past action.

I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting and I know this is going to be another failure, I'm still too scared to go all the way through. I know I'll wake up later, and while I know this, I want so badly to reach out to my friends and ask them to check up on me but I don't want to put them through something as scary as this. I don't want them to have to deal with me during this. I knew this morning the moment I woke up that it would lead to this. I've thought about it all day and throughout I've tried to be happy and loud so they wouldn't worry, so they wouldn't know what I was really thinking. I'm scared right now but I know I'll wake up. I'm sad right now and I want nothing more than someone to sit with me in silence while I cry. But I'm alone. I can't reach out. So all I ask is this, please check up on me later. I can feel myself falling asleep, but as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up. I just want to be checked up on, but I don't want to bother my friends with it. Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION
- The post contains the explicit phrase: ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" This expresses a wish for death, falling under ""wanting to die"" or ""not wanting to survive,"" which is an explicit death wish.
- Other phrases like ""I'm at the end of my rope"" and ""I know this is going to be another failure"" imply distress but are not explicit suicide mentions. However, ""another failure"" references past actions, which will be addressed later.
- Conclusion: Explicit suicide/death wish is present due to ""I hope I don't wake up.""

### Step 2: URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS
- Current/immediate indicators: ""right now"" (e.g., ""I'm at the end of my rope right now""), ""today"" (implied in ""I've thought about it all day""), and the overall present-tense description of distress.
- Past events: ""as I've done this before"" and ""another failure"" indicate past occurrences.
- General/ongoing: ""I've thought about it all day"" suggests persistent thoughts.
- Conclusion: The post shows current urgency with references to past events.

### Step 3: PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT
- No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned for the current situation.
- Phrases like ""I feel my breath slowing down"" and ""I can feel myself falling asleep"" describe physical or emotional states but do not specify a plan or method for suicide.
- ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through"" hints at hesitation but does not detail a method or plan.
- Conclusion: No explicit plan, method, or preparation for current suicide intent is described.

### Step 4: ACTION HISTORY
- The post explicitly references past suicide attempts: ""I know this is going to be another failure"" implies previous unsuccessful attempts, and ""as I've done this before"" directly confirms past actions taken with intent to die.
- These are described as completed actions (even though they failed) with intent, such as ""go all the way through,"" indicating actual past behaviors.
- No interrupted current actions are detailed (e.g., no description of starting but stopping a method now).
- Conclusion: Past completed suicide attempts are clearly described.

### Step 5: DECISION LOGIC
- Explicit suicide/death wish is present (""I hope I don't wake up""), so it is not INDICATOR.
- However, no current plan/method is mentioned, which would point away from BEHAVIOR for the present.
- Critically, the post describes past completed suicide attempts (""another failure"" and ""done this before""), which directly fits the ATTEMPT category: ""actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome.""
- The ""When in Doubt"" rule for BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT states: ""Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions."" Here, the focus on past attempts overrides the current ideation.
- Rule clarification: Past attempts mentioned, even alongside current distress, classify as ATTEMPT per the critical rules.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The explicit death wish (""I hope I don't wake up"") elevates it beyond INDICATOR, but the lack of current plan/method prevents BEHAVIOR. However, the description of past suicide attempts (completed actions with intent) mandates ATTEMPT classification.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including: ""intent to kill myself,"" ""I could die,"" and ""I am going to shoot myself."" Phrases like ""I have ran out of chances"" and ""Goodbye"" further reinforce this in the context of distress.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - There are strong indicators of current/immediate intent: ""It's time,"" ""Not until now,"" ""I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side,"" ""once I post this,"" and ""I am going to shoot myself."" These suggest imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""shoot myself"" with a ""loaded gun."" Preparations are described, such as having the gun readily available (""loaded gun by my side"") and life-settling actions (deleting accounts, emptying the room, depleting savings).

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No past suicide attempts are described. The statement ""I never did it"" confirms that previous intentions did not result in action. There is no mention of interrupted attempts or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""shoot myself"").  
   - A specific plan and preparation are also present (gun method, loaded gun by side).  
   - This falls under BEHAVIOR because it involves explicit suicidal thoughts combined with specific plans, methods, and preparations. It is not ATTEMPT, as no past completed action is described (e.g., ""I never did it"" indicates no attempt occurred).  
   - Rules applied: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to method/plan mention; between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT, choose BEHAVIOR as no past action is described.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit mentions include: ""suicidal episodes,"" ""leave a note for my parents saying its my last time with them,"" and ""swallowed [bleach]"" with intent to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Events occurred in the past (""a week ago""). No current/imminent plans described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific method (swallowing bleach) and preparation (leaving a suicide note) are detailed.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Describes a **completed past action**: swallowed bleach with intent to die (""i thought that was the last breath""). Outcome (vomiting/survival) doesn't change classification.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content + specific method/preparation + **completed past action** → **ATTEMPT** (per rules: ""actual actions taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome"").

   - The desire to die is described in a present, ongoing context (""I still want to die"") but lacks immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The phrase ""when I stop doing everything and sit alone"" indicates a recurring state, not an imminent plan.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research. The post focuses on the emotional barrier (parents' potential suffering) preventing action, but no concrete plan is discussed.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post references past events (""lost my sibling,"" ""after the funeral I basically lost all will to live"") and coping efforts (""tried to pull through""), but there is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. ""Tried to pull through"" refers to coping with grief, not a suicide attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""want to die"") are present, but no plan/method is indicated. According to the rules, this falls under IDEATION. The critical rules emphasize that any explicit death/suicide mention moves the classification out of INDICATOR, and the absence of a plan/method prevents it from being BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I want to die"" is explicit, so not INDICATOR.  
- Intrusive Thoughts: The presence of ""want to die"" qualifies as IDEATION, even with a stated barrier (parents' feelings).  
- When in Doubt: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR only if a method is mentioned—none here, so IDEATION is confirmed.  
- Focus: The suicide risk pertains only to the author, not others (e.g., the deceased sibling).

This time I'm deeper than I've ever been and I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end. I'd rather take a few tabs of acid and see what happens first , if it helps me then hey that's great , if it doesn't , I'll be back in the same spot or worse off than before and my end will only get nearer. I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end"") and implies death wishes with phrases like ""my end will only get nearer"" in the context of distress. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content, as ""thinking of suicide"" is a direct reference and ""my end"" is similar to ""wanting to be gone"" or ""going to die.""

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timing is general/ongoing (""for months on end"") rather than immediate. The person discusses a future conditional outcome (""if it doesn't [help], I'll be back in the same spot... and my end will only get nearer""), but there is no indication of current/imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide plan, method, or preparation is described. The mention of taking ""a few tabs of acid"" is presented as an alternative intervention to avoid suicide, not as a suicide method itself. There is no reference to research, locations, or means for suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The reference to LSD pulling them from ""deepest depths"" suggests past distress but not a concrete suicide action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""thinking of suicide""), but no plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.  
   - According to the rules, this falls under IDEATION. The conditional statement about outcomes does not constitute a plan, as it lacks specificity.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit mention of suicide triggers IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
     - No method or plan means it does not qualify for BEHAVIOR.  
     - No past attempt described, so not ATTEMPT.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan, method, or preparation, aligning with IDEATION.

130,i hit a new low tonight. my dog is older and has a lot of health issues. tonight i stole some my dog's prescription hydrocodone just to feel ok for one night. ive had a bit to drink tonight as well. i havent felt ok in a while and im not sure what to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post mentions stealing and consuming the dog's prescription hydrocodone ""to feel ok for one night,"" along with drinking alcohol, due to not feeling ""ok in a while."" However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, wanting to die, or phrases like ""going to die,"" ""want to be gone,"" etc. The intent is described as seeking temporary relief (""just to feel ok""), not ending life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Timing words like ""tonight"" indicate current distress, but this is tied to substance use for coping, not suicide plans. No past suicide events or ongoing suicidal thoughts are mentioned.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills for overdose), locations, preparations, or research are discussed. The hydrocodone use is framed as self-medication for emotional relief, not as part of a suicide plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The actions described (stealing hydrocodone and drinking) are presented as coping mechanisms, not suicide attempts or self-harm with intent to die. There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors like cutting.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the classification defaults to INDICATOR. The post expresses distress, hopelessness (""i hit a new low,"" ""im not sure what to do""), and life problems (e.g., dog's health issues), but without any suicidal content.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: The language is implicit distress (e.g., ""feel ok""), not explicit suicide ideation.  
- When in Doubt: No suicide content means no ambiguity; INDICATOR is clear.  
- Focus is solely on the author's actions and statements, with no references to others.

131,31/m - I see no point in living anymore. I don't have any friends. Nothing in my life is working out,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - The post states: ""I see no point in living anymore."" This expresses hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life but does not explicitly mention suicide, death wishes, or a desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""want to die,"" or similar explicit terms). It focuses on general despair without direct references to suicide or death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - No indicators of urgency (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or specific timing. The phrase ""anymore"" suggests an ongoing, general state rather than immediate intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, locations, preparations, or research. The content is emotional, not action-oriented.

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses current feelings only.

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die, this meets the criteria for INDICATOR. The post expresses distress (e.g., hopelessness, loneliness, life dissatisfaction) but lacks explicit suicidal content.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - ""I see no point in living anymore"" is implicit (dissatisfaction with life) and not explicit (e.g., ""I want to die""), so it does not escalate to IDEATION.  
     - No doubt between categories; this clearly fits INDICATOR based on the absence of explicit suicide/death language.

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicide-related content: ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow."" This indicates a direct action (taking pills) with the intent to die, as ""might not wake up"" is an expression of death or not wanting to be alive. Even with uncertainty in outcome, the explicit reference to self-harm via pills qualifies as suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""might not wake up tomorrow"" implies immediacy (e.g., ""tomorrow""), and the action ""taken"" is in past tense, indicating the pill-taking has already occurred. This suggests a completed action rather than a future plan.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is mentioned: ""pills."" This is a concrete suicide method, and the description of having ""taken"" them indicates execution, not just planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes a past completed action: ""taken a fuck load of pills."" This is a self-harm behavior with clear intent to die, as evidenced by ""might not wake up tomorrow."" It is not framed as an interrupted or hypothetical scenario (e.g., no mention of being stopped or changing mind).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - There is explicit suicide content (death wish via pills) and a specific method (pills), which would typically suggest BEHAVIOR if it were a plan.  
   - However, the key factor is the past tense ""taken,"" which describes a completed action with intent to die. According to the ATTEMPT category definition, this qualifies as a past suicide attempt, regardless of outcome.  
   - Critical rules: Between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT, choose ATTEMPT for completed past actions. The action here is completed (pills ingested), not preparatory or interrupted.

**Conclusion:** The post describes a past completed suicide attempt (taking pills) with intent to die, fitting the ATTEMPT category.

I'm tired of the constant struggle and have a fear of failing an attempt once again. I intend to do it right this time and not make those around me suffer with the blatant telling of my suicidal thoughts. I will not usher my burden into anyone else and will just silently reminisce with these feelings and my thoughts.

I am and will not be one of those people.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times (e.g., ""planning out my suicide,"" ""my suicidal thoughts""), expresses a desire to die (e.g., ""I will go through with this,"" ""I can't find a reason... to continue living""), and references death wishes. This satisfies the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post indicates a specific future timing for suicide (""beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest""), which is not immediate but planned. It also references a past event (""fear of failing an attempt once again"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes ""planning out my suicide"" and an ""intention"" to act, but no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location is mentioned. Preparations are implied (e.g., not telling anyone, maintaining a facade of normalcy) but not detailed.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""failing an attempt once again""), which is a completed action with intent, regardless of outcome.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present → rules out INDICATOR.
   - A past suicide attempt is described → this triggers the ATTEMPT classification per the rules, which state: ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT"" and ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""

**Critical Rules Applied:**
- The reference to a past attempt (""failing an attempt once again"") is a completed action, making ATTEMPT the correct category.
- Even though current planning is mentioned, the presence of a past attempt overrides and classifies as ATTEMPT per the rules.
- No ambiguity: The explicit past attempt description meets the ATTEMPT definition.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit phrases include: ""do not want to live anymore,"" ""kill myself,"" ""hate being alive,"" and ""wish I was never born."" These directly reference death wishes/suicide.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   ""Sometimes I wonder if I should just do it now"" implies recurring thoughts with a current urgency cue (""now""), but the conclusion (""For now I guess I will just sit here"") indicates no immediate intent.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research mentioned. Only hypothetical timing (""if I wait for later"").  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The statement ""I am too scared to kill myself"" confirms no action taken.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself,"" ""do not want to live"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation described.  
   - Past attempts are absent.  
   - **Classification**: IDEATION (explicit suicidal intent without plans/methods).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit mention of ""attempt suicide"" and ""hang myself"" clearly references suicide and self-inflicted death.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   ""Frequently"" indicates recurring behavior, not immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific method described: hanging, with details about setup (using a chair/elevated object to control outcomes).  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Describes repeated physical actions: hanging themselves with precautions to avoid death (""always leave a chair... so I don't die""). This qualifies as interrupted attempts (actions initiated but stopped).  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content (✓)  
   - Specific method/preparations (✓)  
   - **BUT**: Actions are interrupted (not completed attempts), falling under BEHAVIOR per rules: ""Interrupted attempts where action was initiated → BEHAVIOR"".  
   - Past attempts (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself last week"") would be ATTEMPT, but here actions are ongoing and intentionally non-lethal.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Interrupted actions (Rule 3) → BEHAVIOR  
- ""Attempt"" in post refers to actions with safeguards, not completed suicide attempts (Rule 4).

I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years"", ""i had an attempt when I was 14"", ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"".  
   - Specific phrases: ""suicidal"", ""attempt"", ""don't want to go on"" directly reference suicide/death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Past events: ""I had an attempt when I was 14"", ""a few close calls"".  
   - Current state: ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"" expresses ongoing distress but lacks immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No current methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned. References to past attempts lack method details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Clear past action: ""I had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out"" describes a completed suicide attempt with intent.  
   - Additional context: ""a few close calls"" suggests interrupted actions, but the explicit past attempt dominates.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (IDEATION) AND a described past completed attempt (ATTEMPT) exist.  
   - Classification rules: Past completed attempts always override concurrent ideation/behavior and warrant ATTEMPT category.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""killing myself"" (stated twice), ""do it"" (referring to suicide), ""die in my sleep"", and ""increase my chances of corona"" (implying death from COVID-19 through self-harm). Self-harm (""cutting"") is also mentioned, which is related to suicide risk.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Future intent: ""One of these days I'll finally do it"" and ""I'll break killing myself regardless"" indicate non-specific future timing.  
   - Past events: ""I've done it many times"" refers to past suicide attempts, and ""I figured out how to properly hang myself"" suggests past planning.  
   - Current barriers: ""at the moment there is too much potential interference"" implies no immediate action.  
   - Overall: Focus is on past actions and future intent, not immediate urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods are described: ""hang myself"" (explicit method) and ""start cutting again"" (self-harm as a potential suicide-related behavior). Preparation is indicated with ""figured out how to properly hang myself"".

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Past completed suicide attempts are explicitly stated: ""I've done it many times"" (where ""it"" refers to killing oneself). This is a clear description of past actions with intent to die. Self-harm history is implied with ""start cutting again"".

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""killing myself""), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - Past suicide attempts are described (""I've done it many times""), which directly fits the ATTEMPT category (""posts describing past completed suicide attempts"").  
   - Critical rules: When past attempts are mentioned (even alongside current plans like ""I'll finally do it""), the classification is ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, despite current plans (BEHAVIOR-like elements), the explicit mention of past completed actions takes precedence.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts... telling me to end it all,"" which is a direct reference to suicide or death wishes. Phrases like ""end it all"" and ""if I kept existing"" indicate a desire to not be alive, falling under explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The thoughts are described as ongoing (""for over the course of a year"") and persistent (""thoughts in the back of my head""), with no immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" This suggests general/ongoing ideation rather than current urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post only references thoughts and feelings of doom, without details on how suicide might be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses solely on thoughts, not actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""end it all""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past suicide attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, it fits IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""End it all"" is explicit, so IDEATION is chosen over INDICATOR.  
- Intrusive thoughts (""thoughts... telling me"") still count as IDEATION.

   Explicit mentions include:  
   - ""I tried to drown myself""  
   - ""I tried to hang""  
   - ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor""  
   These are direct references to suicide actions.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   All suicidal actions are described in the past tense (""tried,"" ""chickened out""). No current/imminent plans or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods are listed: drowning, hanging, jumping from a building (4th floor).  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post details three concrete suicide attempts: drowning, hanging, and jumping. All were interrupted (""chickened out"").  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide methods and locations confirm **BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT** scope.  
   - Actions were initiated but not completed (interrupted), falling under **BEHAVIOR** per Critical Rule 3.  
   - Past attempts are described, but no *completed* actions occurred (Rule 4/5: ""BEHAVIOR"" for interrupted actions).  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Interrupted actions (drowning/hanging/jumping) = **BEHAVIOR** (Rule 3).  
- No evidence of *completed* past suicide attempt → not **ATTEMPT**.  
- Explicit methods + action initiation → overrides IDEATION.

This satisfies the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The language indicates current and increasing suicidal intent: ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"" and ""I might actually get the courage to do it"" suggest ongoing and escalating thoughts, but there are no immediate time indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The reference to age 15 (""I would have been gone when I was 15 years old"") is a past hypothetical, not a past action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**

   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, interrupted attempt, or self-harm. The statement ""I would have been gone when I was 15 years old"" is conditional and hypothetical, indicating consideration but not action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""suicide""), but there is no specific plan, method, or preparation described. Therefore, based on the rules:
     - Explicit suicide thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.
   - Critical rules applied:
     - Explicit vs. Implicit: Phrases like ""kill myself"" are explicit, so it cannot be INDICATOR.
     - Intrusive Thoughts: Not directly applicable, but explicit mention requires IDEATION.
     - Interrupted Actions: None mentioned.
     - Past vs. Present: Focus on current ideation; the past reference is not an attempt.
     - When in doubt: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, no method is mentioned, so IDEATION. Between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT, no past attempt described.

142,Too much. Well it finally happened I got to the point where the pain is too much and the 'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better. I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions death and suicide: ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" directly expresses a wish to die, and the phrase ""if you wanted to die you would"" references suicidal thoughts. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post includes immediate timing indicators: ""today"" (in reference to getting alcohol) and ""in less than 24 hours"" for the expected outcome of death. This indicates current/immediate intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods and preparations are described: ""I have enough Trazodone"" (a medication that can be lethal in overdose) and ""will get alcohol today"" (to combine with Trazodone, increasing lethality). This shows clear planning and acquisition of means.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The focus is on future plans, not completed past actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from step 1), and a specific plan/method is identified (from step 3). According to the rules, this combination classifies as BEHAVIOR.  
   - It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described (e.g., the post discusses future intent: ""will get... and be dead"").  
   - The urgency and preparations reinforce BEHAVIOR classification.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit content confirmed (e.g., ""be dead"").  
- When in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to method/plan mention (Trazodone + alcohol).  
- Risk applies only to the author; no other people are mentioned.

143,"Every year I think things are going to get better, and they don't. Every year that rolls around, I think things are going to get better. Out of the whole year, I probably have 2 good months then the rest is just darkness. My sister just gave birth to my first nephew on June 3rd. My birthday is on the 14th of this month as well. I should be happy, but I'm not. I really am tired of my obsessive negative thoughts. I've been struggling since I was a child, and it's been so long since I've been happy. Nothing makes sense anymore, I want to give up. Even typing this, I feel guilty for feeling this way. The only one who is bringing myself pain is me- telling myself negative things every day. All of the abuse and shit I've experienced is in the past, and I'm still allowing it to control me. Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives? I bring nothing to the table. Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains expressions of distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness (e.g., ""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive,"" ""My life has no worth""). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive. Phrases like ""I want to give up"" and ""Why am I alive"" are implicit expressions of despair but do not explicitly reference death or suicide as defined in the framework (e.g., missing terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die,"" or equivalent explicit phrases).

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post references ongoing, general struggles (e.g., ""Every year I think things are going to get better,"" ""I've been struggling since I was a child"") with no current or immediate timing indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). Past experiences like abuse are mentioned, but not in the context of suicidal actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The content focuses on emotional and cognitive distress without any indication of planning or intent.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. References to past abuse or negative thoughts do not constitute suicidal actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there are no explicit suicide or death wishes, the post falls under INDICATOR. The content expresses severe distress, hopelessness, guilt, and life dissatisfaction but lacks explicit suicidal ideation, plans, or behaviors.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": Implied despair (e.g., ""I want to give up"") is not explicit enough for IDEATION.  
     - ""When in Doubt"": No explicit suicide mention, so not escalated to IDEATION.

**Conclusion:** The post meets the criteria for INDICATOR due to the absence of explicit suicidal content despite strong expressions of emotional distress.

(Maybe cushion the pain idk. )I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""it will finally kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself,"" and ""I'm going to die."" These phrases clearly express a desire to die or end life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timing is not immediate but gradual, with phrases like ""slowly kill myself"" and references to a future process (e.g., achieving a goal weight of 78 pounds or lower). There are no past events or attempts described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is outlined: using anorexia to starve to death by setting weight loss goals (current weight 90 pounds, goal of 78 pounds or lower). The post describes preparations, such as adjusting the goal weight to ensure death and framing it as a way to ""cushion the pain"" for others.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No past suicide attempts are mentioned. The post references ongoing self-harm through anorexia, but this is part of the current suicidal plan, not a historical attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""going to die"").  
   - A specific plan and method (starvation via anorexia with weight targets) are described.  
   - According to the rules: Explicit thoughts + plan/method → BEHAVIOR.  
   - This is not an ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described (e.g., no mention of a prior overdose or similar event).  
   - The ongoing anorexia behavior is part of the suicidal plan, reinforcing BEHAVIOR classification.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit suicide content is present, so not INDICATOR.  
- Plan/method (anorexia for suicide) is specified, so not IDEATION.  
- No past completed action, so not ATTEMPT.  
- The focus is on the person writing the post, and their described actions/plans.

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the phrase ""suicide from charcoal bbq,"" which directly references killing oneself or ending life. This is an explicit expression of suicide-related content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post is framed as a question (""Is it possible..."") with no immediate time indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). It focuses on feasibility rather than current or past actions, so urgency is not present.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post specifies a method: ""charcoal bbq in a tent,"" which refers to using carbon monoxide poisoning from a barbecue in an enclosed space. Additionally, asking ""is it possible"" constitutes researching or seeking information about suicide methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past attempts, actions, or self-harm. The post is purely inquisitive about a method.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (suicide is mentioned).  
   - A specific method and research about that method are included.  
   - No past attempt is described.  
   According to the logic: Explicit suicide thoughts + method/research → **BEHAVIOR**.  

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- The word ""suicide"" is explicit, and the method (charcoal bbq) is specific, so this is not IDEATION.  
- Researching methods falls under BEHAVIOR.  
- No past action, so not ATTEMPT.  
- The person is writing about themselves, and the classification is clear.

146,"Life so full of contradictions that it's not worth it. I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrase: ""everything that makes me want to die"" directly expresses a death wish.  
   - Later states ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" (likely typo for ""suicide""), but explicit death wish is still present.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Uses ongoing/general terms: ""feel,"" ""always,"" ""still,"" ""I think"" – no immediate timing cues.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of death wishes: ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying."" These phrases directly express a desire to die or not be alive, which qualifies as explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The expressions are in present tense (e.g., ""I want,"" ""I feel""), indicating current and ongoing distress, but there are no specific immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" No past suicide attempts or actions are mentioned.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of any specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparation, or research. The focus is on emotional distress related to a relationship issue.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is solely about feelings and thoughts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to die,"" ""don't want to live,"" ""feel like dying""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. Therefore, based on the framework, this falls under IDEATION (explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or methods).

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all?

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains no explicit mentions of suicide, killing self, ending life, or wanting to die.  
   - Closest reference: Metaphor of a ""sick dog"" eventually being ""put down,"" but this is not a direct expression of personal suicidal intent.  
   - Phrases like ""I don't want to be alive"" or ""I wish I was dead"" are absent.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate timing cues (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").  
   - References to ""3 weeks"" are future-oriented but relate to life circumstances, not suicide plans.  
   - No past suicide attempts described.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research.  
   - Violent thoughts (""hurting everyone,"" ""stabbing someone"") target others, not self.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No descriptions of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.  
   - Mentions of trauma and dissociation are retrospective, not action-oriented.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - **NO explicit suicide/death wishes** → Falls under INDICATOR.  
   - Distress themes: Hopelessness (""can't do it anymore""), dissociation (""Nothing's real""), self-loathing (""abomination""), and desire for validation through trauma/illness.  
   - Violent ideation is externally directed, not self-directed.  
   - Metaphor of ""putting down"" a sick dog reflects despair but lacks literal suicide intent.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Metaphors like ""put down"" are **implicit**, not explicit suicide expressions.  
- No methods, plans, or past attempts override INDICATOR classification.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" and ""demise"" (referring to death). Phrases like ""do 'it'"" also imply suicidal intent. Even though the user states they don't think they would act on it, the explicit references qualify as suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The user describes ongoing thoughts (""on and off for months"") and a past action (""Yesterday, I drafted my will""). There is no immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""), as they currently feel better and are ""out of my hole for now.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific preparations are mentioned, including ""plotting my suicide seriously"" and drafting a will, which is a concrete step in planning for death. While no specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons) are described as intended for use, the plotting and preparation indicate active planning. The user also references considerations like not using household weapons and ensuring only trained personnel find them, showing method-related thinking.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions. Drafting a will is a preparatory step but not an attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide"").  
   - Preparations (drafting a will and serious plotting) are also present, indicating behavior beyond mere thoughts.  
   - Since there is explicit suicidal ideation with preparation, this falls under BEHAVIOR according to the rules (preparations like writing notes or plotting qualify as behavior).  
   - No past attempt is described, so ATTEMPT does not apply.  
   - Rules clarification: Even with disclaimers like ""I don't think I would do 'it'"", the explicit content with preparation requires BEHAVIOR classification. When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if any plan/preparation is mentioned.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post expresses distress, hopelessness, and interpersonal conflict (e.g., ""i hate tough love,"" ""i am so sick of this,"" ""i get abused enough at home"").
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive. Phrases like ""i want it to stop"" refer to the stressful situation or relationships, not life itself, and ""i have no one"" indicates loneliness but not a death wish.
   - Conclusion: No explicit suicide/death content identified.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The post describes a recent event (""today Z started mocking me"") and ongoing issues (""i have said time and time again,"" ""i get abused enough at home""), but these are tied to emotional distress, not suicidal intent. No timing indicators related to suicide (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") are present.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The content focuses on relational problems and criticism.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No references to past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The mention of abuse (""i get abused enough at home"") is about external victimization, not self-inflicted actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the classification defaults to INDICATOR, as per the rule: ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR.""
   - The post contains severe distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction (e.g., feeling isolated, abused, and frustrated with relationships) without crossing into explicit suicidal expressions.

**Critical Rules Check:**
- Explicit vs. Implicit: All phrases are implicit distress (e.g., ""i want it to stop"" is situational, not life-ending). No ambiguity.
- When in Doubt: Not applicable, as no suicide content exists to trigger IDEATION or higher.
- Focus on the writer: All content pertains to the user's experiences, not others.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" in the phrase ""I don't want to kill myself, but..."" This constitutes an explicit reference to suicide, even though it is negated. According to the rules, any explicit mention of suicide, death, or wanting to die (including in a context of denial or intrusive thoughts) must be considered.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The content focuses on life dissatisfaction and desires for change (e.g., wanting a job, independence), not on planning or acting on suicidal thoughts.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The user references life experiences (e.g., pushing friends away, being melancholic) but no actions related to suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself""), satisfying the threshold for IDEATION or higher.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, ruling out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
   - According to critical rules, the explicit mention of suicide (even in denial) necessitates IDEATION over INDICATOR. The denial (""I don't want to"") does not downgrade the classification, as per the intrusive thoughts example.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION: explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or methods.

153,Life just gets more and more overwhelming and difficult. How to deal with suicidal thoughts and ideations. I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family but I know I shouldn't I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out . Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions:  
   - ""suicidal thoughts and ideations""  
   - ""I want to die tomorrow""  
   - ""I want to kill myself""  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""tomorrow"" indicates near-future timing (current/immediate intent).  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or location described.  
   - Mentions ""while my mom is out"" (timing) but no concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No past attempts described (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or actions taken).  
   - Self-describes as ""too weak and pathetic to do it,"" confirming no prior/current action.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""want to die,"" ""want to kill myself"") are present.  
   - **No specific method, preparation, or interrupted attempt described** → **IDEATION**.  
   - Urgency (""tomorrow"") alone doesn’t elevate to BEHAVIOR without method/plan details.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit death wishes trigger IDEATION minimum.  
- ""Want to die tomorrow"" lacks method specificity, so not BEHAVIOR.  
- Self-harm/inaction (""too weak to do it"") doesn’t imply past attempt.

154,my good days make me realize how useless life is. after having a huge depressive episode I've been having what I'd consider 'good' days for the past couple days. nothing bad has happened to me. everything has been good. and I'm still dead inside. still sad. still anhedonic. I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post includes the phrase ""yeet myself,"" which is internet slang explicitly meaning to harm or kill oneself (e.g., by jumping or throwing oneself off something). This constitutes an explicit expression of a death wish or suicidal intent, even if metaphorical language like ""dead inside"" is used elsewhere in a non-literal sense.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The phrase ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"" indicates a current and intense desire (""want to""), but it lacks specific timing words like ""now,"" ""today,"" or ""tonight."" It expresses an ongoing urge rather than immediate plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - ""Yeet myself"" is a general reference to self-harm or suicide but does not specify a method (e.g., pills, jumping from a location), preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or research. No details on locations, setups, or actions are provided.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - The post describes current feelings of sadness, anhedonia, and hopelessness but does not mention any past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. All content is focused on present emotions and thoughts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""yeet myself""), so the post is not INDICATOR.
   - There are explicit suicidal thoughts but no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.
   - No past suicide attempts are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.
   - Therefore, based on the framework, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Applied:**
- ""Yeet myself"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent, similar to ""I want to kill myself,"" which qualifies for IDEATION even without a method.
- No method or plan details elevate it to BEHAVIOR.
- The focus is on the person's current thoughts, with no past actions.
- When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR only if any method is mentioned; here, none is specified.

But now i fucked up and i might lose my license. If i lose my job because of it I might have to move back home with my parents as a 24 year old now. God im such a fucking loser. i could really use someone to talk too. All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all. I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post includes explicit mentions related to suicide: ""I tried to end it once before"" (where ""end it"" is a common euphemism for suicide) and ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" (referring to wishing the past suicide attempt had been fatal). These phrases indicate explicit expressions of death wishes or suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The suicidal content is framed in the past tense (""tried,"" ""once before"") and uses ""sometimes"" for the wish, indicating recurring thoughts rather than immediate or current plans. No words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" suggest urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The description is vague and focused on the past event, not current plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt: ""I tried to end it once before."" This indicates a concrete action was taken with intent to die, even though it was not fatal (as indicated by ""wish i succeeded""). This qualifies as a past completed action under the ATTEMPT category.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since the post describes a past suicide attempt (a completed action, regardless of outcome), it falls under ATTEMPT according to the classification rules. The mention of ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" reflects ongoing ideation but does not override the presence of the past attempt. No current plans or methods are indicated, so BEHAVIOR does not apply. Explicit suicide content rules out INDICATOR and IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Application:**
- The suicide risk pertains only to the author, and the past attempt is clearly described.
- ""I tried to end it"" constitutes a completed past action (attempt) under the framework, even if interrupted or unsuccessful.
- Between categories: The past attempt takes precedence, leading to ATTEMPT classification.

156,Can I please ! Talk to someone ? I'm having a bad panic attack. 18 and over please I just wanna kill myself out of fear,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I just wanna kill myself,"" which directly mentions suicide and wanting to die. This satisfies the criterion for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I just wanna kill myself"" suggests a current desire (""wanna"" implies present want), but it lacks specific timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It is driven by a panic attack, indicating distress, but no immediate or past action is described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparation, or research. The statement is a general expression of wanting to die without details on how.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors is present. The post focuses on current feelings during a panic attack.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I just wanna kill myself"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.  
   - Therefore, this falls under IDEATION according to the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide overrules INDICATOR (e.g., ""I just wanna kill myself"" is explicit).  
- No method or plan, so not BEHAVIOR.  
- No past action, so not ATTEMPT.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION since no method is specified.

157,"Thought I was doing better. Now my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with. Every time I am back here, I feel more and more defeated. I'll never be out of this torture cycle, so why keep going?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions related to death or suicide. Specifically:  
   - ""my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with"" – ""get it over with"" is a phrase that, in the context of distress, explicitly implies a desire to end life (similar to ""want it to be over"" as per the framework).  
   - ""why keep going?"" – this questions the purpose of continuing life, indicating an explicit death wish when combined with the distressed context (e.g., ""torture cycle,"" ""defeated"").  
   - Even though the person does not use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" the phrases are explicit under the framework's guidelines for death wishes in distress contexts.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""Now my brain is screaming"" indicates current/immediate suicidal thoughts.  
   - ""Every time I am back here"" suggests recurring or ongoing ideation, but no specific timing for action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""today"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The content is focused on thoughts and feelings, not plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or specific actions).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (as identified in Step 1), but there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation.  
   - According to the logic: Explicit thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - The intrusive thought (""my brain is screaming at me..."") still qualifies as IDEATION per the critical rules, even if the person expresses ambivalence.

**Classification Decision:**  
- This fits IDEATION: Explicit expressions of wanting to die or end life without specific plans or methods.  
- Not INDICATOR because there are explicit death wishes. Not BEHAVIOR because no plan/method is mentioned. Not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.

And I feel stupid for crying about it, because I feel like I'm a person who gets offended over everything. This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts. Thank you for listening.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" in the phrase: ""This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts."" This is a direct reference to suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die, as defined in the framework. Even though it's framed as a reason for distress, the explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" qualifies under suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""currently"" indicates these thoughts are ongoing and present, but there are no specific urgency indicators like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to."" The context is general distress rather than immediate action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping), location (e.g., bridge), preparation (e.g., acquiring means), or research. The post only references thoughts, not plans or actions.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors is present. The focus is solely on current thoughts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal thoughts"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.  
   - No past attempt is described.  
   - Therefore, based on the logic: Explicit thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" triggers IDEATION, even if the person expresses distress or reasons behind it.  
- No ambiguity between categories: Explicit content rules out INDICATOR; lack of plan/method rules out BEHAVIOR; lack of past action rules out ATTEMPT.  
- Focus is on the writer's current state.

So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""planning to commit suicide,"" ""I have to go"" (in context, meaning to die), and ""end it"" (referring to ending life). Phrases like ""have no choice but to end it"" and ""I'll never be happy if I continue to live"" reinforce the desire to die. This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language indicates current and ongoing suicidal thoughts, e.g., ""planning to commit suicide,"" ""I have to go,"" and ""have no choice but to end it."" There are no specific time-bound words like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but the present-tense planning suggests immediacy in intent. No past attempts are described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The word ""planning"" implies intent but lacks concrete details about how, where, or when the suicide would occur. This remains vague and does not specify a method or plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current thoughts and feelings, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""planning to commit suicide""), but there is no evidence of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, based on the rules:  
     - Explicit suicide thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules clarification: ""Planning to commit suicide"" indicates intent but is not specific enough for BEHAVIOR (which requires methods or preparations). When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION if no method is mentioned.

I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   The post explicitly mentions ""attempting suicide"" twice (""going through with attempting suicide"" and ""so close to attempting suicide""). Phrases like ""I want to be gone"" are absent, but explicit suicide terminology is present.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   The language (""was so close,"" ""in a moment of desperation"") refers to a recent near-attempt but frames it as a past crisis that was avoided by texting the mother. No immediate timing words (""tonight,"" ""now"") appear.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location is mentioned. The post describes avoidance of an attempt (""dumped everything on my mom"") rather than planning/preparation.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   The phrase ""so close to attempting suicide"" implies strong intent but no completed action. The person intervened by texting their mother instead, confirming no actual attempt occurred. Self-harm or past attempts are not described.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide mention? **YES** → Rules out *indicator*.  
   - Specific plan/method/preparation? **NO** → Rules out *behavior*.  
   - Past completed attempt? **NO** (action was interrupted by reaching out) → Rules out *attempt*.  
   → Falls under **IDEATION** (explicit suicidal thoughts without plans/methods).  

**Critical Rules Check**:  
- ""So close to attempting suicide"" expresses explicit suicidal intent but lacks actionable details.  
- The interrupted action (texting mom instead) aligns with *ideation*, not *behavior* or *attempt* (per Rule 3: Interrupted actions are *behavior* only if an action was initiated, like putting a noose around the neck; here, no physical action was taken).  
- No ambiguity between categories: Explicit ideation without plans/methods/attempts → **IDEATION**.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" in the phrase ""I wont kill myself of course."" This is a direct reference to suicide, even though it is denied. According to the rules, explicit mentions of suicide or death wishes still count, regardless of disclaimers like ""of course.""

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - There are no indicators of immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past events related to suicide. The focus is on current emotional pain (""I cant take it,"" ""excruciating""), but this is not tied to a specific suicide timeline.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or locations for suicide are mentioned. The post describes urges to ""scream and break everything,"" which are expressions of distress but not related to suicide methods or planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post only discusses current feelings.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""kill myself"") are present, but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. Therefore, this falls under IDEATION. The denial (""I wont kill myself of course"") does not change the classification, as explicit mentions always qualify for IDEATION or higher.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide triggers IDEATION, even with disclaimers (per Suicide Content Identification rule and Intrusive Thoughts rule).  
- No evidence of BEHAVIOR (no plan/method) or ATTEMPT (no past action).  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen due to explicit suicide reference.  

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal ideation without plans or actions, fitting the IDEATION category.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post discusses gender dysphoria, distress about appearance, and a desire to be male. There is no mention of suicide, death wishes, wanting to die, or phrases like ""going to die"" or ""want to be gone."" The statement ""I want to be a male now"" expresses a gender identity desire, not a wish for death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No urgency indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or timing references related to suicide are present. The post focuses on ongoing feelings of dysphoria and dissatisfaction.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The content is about personal identity and social pressures.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post does not reference any actions taken toward suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die, the post falls under INDICATOR. It expresses distress (gender dysphoria, obsession with appearance, and dissatisfaction with gender norms) but lacks any suicidal content.  
   - Rules applied:  
     - Explicit vs. Implicit: Distress is implicit (no death-related phrases).  
     - When in doubt: No suicide mention, so not IDEATION; clearly not BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains the phrase ""how I wish I had the courage to end it all,"" which explicitly expresses a desire to end one's life. ""End it all"" is a common euphemism for suicide. Additionally, statements like ""how much I absolutely hate myself"" and ""how much I loathe my existence"" indicate distress but do not explicitly mention suicide or death on their own. The key phrase ""end it all"" meets the criteria for explicit suicide/death content, as per the framework.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post uses general/ongoing language like ""wish I had,"" ""here I stay. waiting.,"" and references to enduring life (""I just want the courage to endure it all""). There are no immediate timing indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past event descriptions (e.g., ""I tried""). The mention of ""today was another day"" refers to a bad day but not to imminent suicide plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or research. The focus is on emotional expression and support for others, with no details on how the person would act on suicidal thoughts.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The phrase ""I did it"" refers to creating a Reddit account, not a suicide attempt or self-harm. There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""wish I had the courage to end it all""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, ruling out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION (explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or methods).  

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**  
- ""End it all"" is explicit in the context of distress, confirming suicide content.  
- The mixed messaging (e.g., encouraging others to ""stay around"") does not negate the explicit ideation.  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR and IDEATION, the explicit mention requires IDEATION classification.  
- The risk assessment focuses solely on the author, and no other category fits.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide: ""i almost committed suicide"" and ""i still consider"" (referring to considering suicide). Phrases like ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now"" imply a wish for death in a hypothetical context, but the direct references to suicide are clear and explicit.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""A few days ago"" indicates a recent past event (the near-suicide incident). ""Still consider"" suggests ongoing suicidal thoughts without immediate timing words like ""now"" or ""today."" The future birthday mention isn't directly tied to suicide timing.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The phrase ""i didn't have anything to do it with"" implies consideration of a method (though not specified) and a barrier (lack of means). This indicates preparation or intent, but no detailed method (e.g., pills, hanging) is described.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - ""I almost committed suicide"" describes an interrupted attempt—action was initiated but not completed due to lack of means. This aligns with interrupted attempts under BEHAVIOR. There is no mention of a completed past suicide attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""almost committed suicide,"" ""still consider""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There is evidence of plan/method consideration (""didn't have anything to do it with""), and an interrupted attempt occurred, so it meets BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - This is not ATTEMPT because no completed action is described (only an ""almost"" event).  
   - Applying Critical Rules:  
     - Rule 3: Interrupted actions like ""almost committed suicide"" are BEHAVIOR.  
     - Rule 5: Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to the method/preparation implication and interrupted action.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" repeatedly (""suicide with me,"" ""suicide with me together,"" ""want to suicide too""). This directly expresses a desire to die or engage in suicide.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""suicide with me"" implies an immediate/current desire (""with me"" suggests present intent), but no explicit timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The focus is on finding partners, not describing how suicide would occur.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.

But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I want to kms"" (kill myself), ""I really want to hang myself right now,"" ""when I kill myself,"" ""can't stop thinking about killing myself.""  
   - Death wishes are clearly stated multiple times.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Immediate intent: ""right now,"" ""can't wait any longer,"" ""trying again.""  
   - Ongoing thoughts: ""I have always said,"" ""can't stop thinking.""  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: ""hang myself,"" ""put the rope around my neck.""  
   - Preparations: Discusses prerequisites (packing apartment, resigning job, setting aside money) and ""practiced hung for a minute or two.""  
   - Research/action: Physical rehearsal with the rope.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Describes an interrupted action: ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung... but I stopped."" This is not a past completed attempt but an initiated action that was halted.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (IDEATION threshold met).  
   - Specific method (hanging) and preparation (acquiring rope, rehearsing) → Elevates to BEHAVIOR.  
   - Interrupted action (""practice hung"") qualifies as BEHAVIOR under rules (initiated action stopped).  
   - No mention of a past completed attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Interrupted actions (rope rehearsal) are BEHAVIOR, not ATTEMPT.  
- Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation = BEHAVIOR.  
- Urgency (""right now"") supports current risk but doesn’t change classification.

167,"I'm finally doing it. I think I'm finally going to actually do it. I've been sobbing for the last few hours. I think I'm finally ready to do it. I finally got confirmation that my fiancé doesn't really care. It's finally fucking time. I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun. I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead. Then he will survive, then he won't need to work out a way to keep two people afloat with only his job. He'll only need to focus on himself and I'll finally be at peace. I told him today. I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job. I've pushed my fiancé away I guess if he didn't even bother to do this for me, to care that I haven't stopped crying. I just want to fucking die. I don't want to be here any more.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit references to suicide: ""I'm finally going to actually do it"" (contextually about suicide), ""violently suicidal,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" and ""my suicidal ideation."" Mentions of death wishes like ""I'll finally be at peace"" and ""I don't want to be here anymore"" further confirm explicit suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Strong immediacy is present: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally ready,"" and ""it's finally fucking time"" indicate current intent. Distress markers (""sobbing for hours,"" ""haven't stopped crying"") and present-tense declarations (""I don't want to be here"") reinforce urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is mentioned: ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" Though uncertain (""I don't know how exactly""), the explicit consideration of a firearm qualifies as method ideation per rules (any method mention suffices for BEHAVIOR).

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No past attempts or interrupted actions described. References to past ideation (""my suicidal ideation"") and conversations about feelings don't constitute attempts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (✓) + Method mention (gun) → **BEHAVIOR**  
   - No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT  
   - Uncertainty about method doesn't downgrade classification (rules specify ""ANY method/plan"" triggers BEHAVIOR).

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide-related intentions: ""end things"" (a euphemism for suicide) and ""at the edge"" (implying being on the brink of suicide). This qualifies as explicit suicide content, as per the framework (even indirect phrases like these count when in distress context).

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The action described (""just finished driving up to the mountains"") is in the recent past, with the person stating it was ""impulsive."" However, they indicate no current intent (""I don't think I'm going to do it""), reducing immediate urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is a specific plan and location mentioned: driving to the mountains to ""end things,"" implying a method (e.g., jumping) and preparation (traveling to the location). This shows concrete planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The person describes initiating an action (driving to the mountains with ""full intentions"") but not completing it, as they stopped (""I don't think I'm going to do it""). This is an interrupted attempt, which falls under preparatory behavior.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from step 1), so not INDICATOR.  
   - There is a specific plan and location (mountains), so it exceeds IDEATION.  
   - The interrupted action (driving with intent but not acting) qualifies as BEHAVIOR, not ATTEMPT, since no completed suicide attempt occurred.  
   - Critical rules: Interrupted actions are BEHAVIOR; when in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if any plan/method is mentioned (mountains location here).

**Final Classification Reasoning:**  
The post describes explicit suicidal intent with a specific plan (method and location) and an initiated but interrupted action, fitting the BEHAVIOR category. It does not describe a completed past attempt, so not ATTEMPT.

169,"I'm ready to die :). The date was set a while ago. I even changed it, but nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life. I'm ready. Preps being made for me to go out the way I want. I'm strapped in and ready to go. Fuck this world.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes: ""I'm ready to die :)."" and ""I'm ready to go."" These phrases directly indicate a desire to end life. Additionally, ""go out the way I want"" implies a self-directed end of life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There is a sense of imminence and planning: ""The date was set a while ago. I even changed it..."" suggests ongoing preparation, and ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" conveys current readiness. However, no specific immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific preparations are described: ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"" and ""I'm strapped in and ready to go."" ""Strapped in"" could imply a method involving restraint (e.g., for a vehicle-based method or similar), and ""the way I want"" indicates a chosen approach, though the exact method isn't detailed. This shows active planning and preparation.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried""). References to setting/changing a date are part of planning, not completed actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""ready to die""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There is evidence of planning/preparation (""preps being made,"" ""strapped in""), so it meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR (explicit thoughts + plan/method/preparation).  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit death wishes are clear, so IDEATION or higher is confirmed.  
- Preparations are mentioned, elevating it to BEHAVIOR.  
- ""Strapped in"" suggests an action-oriented step, but as it describes readiness rather than a completed past action, it is not ATTEMPT.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR due to the presence of preparations.

I still sleep in class but my teachers now dont care much which i guess is good.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""Im thinking of ending my life,"" which directly refers to suicide or death wishes. This includes phrases like ""ending life"" as specified in the framework.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The phrase ""thinking of"" indicates a current or ongoing contemplation, but there are no immediate time indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" Past events (e.g., OCD development in 2017, school issues) are mentioned, but these are life stressors, not directly tied to suicide timing.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are described. The post focuses on life problems (e.g., academic struggles, social issues, OCD, depression) without detailing how suicide might be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses past mental health and life events but not any actions taken to end life.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""Im thinking of ending my life""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned. According to the framework, this falls under IDEATION.

**CRITICAL RULES APPLICATION:**
- Explicit mention of death wishes (""ending my life"") confirms IDEATION over INDICATOR.
- No method/plan rules out BEHAVIOR.
- No past attempt rules out ATTEMPT.
- The classification is based solely on the author's expressed thoughts, not other people or events.

171,its working!. hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""pls let me never wake up"" explicitly expresses a wish for death (equivalent to ""wanting to die"" or ""not wanting to be alive"").  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   ""hopefully"" and ""last post"" suggest future intent but lack immediate time markers (e.g., ""tonight"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method, location, preparation, or research mentioned.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   ""its working!"" is ambiguous but lacks description of a concrete past suicide attempt (e.g., overdose).  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit death wish present → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Rules out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed action → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   → Falls under IDEATION (explicit wish to die without plan).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes: ""saying im gonna do it"" (where ""it"" contextually refers to suicide), ""tonight im gonna do it,"" and ""im so ready to die."" This confirms explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""tonight"" indicates immediate timing and urgency, suggesting current intent to act.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods and preparations are described: having ""42 unnamed pills"" (identified as old antidepressants and allergy medicine), noting they are ""really small so its easy to swallow,"" and stating ""this time i actually have the means to."" This shows concrete planning and preparation for suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The user references past expressions (""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"") but no actual past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions are described. The focus is on current intent and means.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""ready to die"").  
   - A specific plan/method (pills) and preparations (acquiring and describing pills) are mentioned.  
   - No past completed suicide attempt is described (only past inaction).  
   - This fits the BEHAVIOR category: explicit suicidal thoughts with specific plans/methods/preparations.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit content is clear (e.g., ""ready to die"" is direct).  
- ""Tonight"" and pill details indicate current behavior, not past attempt.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Method/preparation confirms BEHAVIOR.  
- Risk applies only to the user (no others mentioned).

I don't feel like anyone loves me or even likes me, except maybe my parents but I don't feel like it goes beyond loving me just cause I'm their kid. They don't actually love me for me. And even if they do, I don't feel like I can open up and talk with them about how I'm feeling and about my problems. I'm just to anxious to do it. I'm very lonely.

I guess it does feel good to at least get all of this off my chest.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" in the phrase: ""More and more often it feels like the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself."" This is a direct reference to suicide and wanting to die. Phrases like ""I want to be done"" are contextualized by this explicit mention, confirming suicide-related content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language expresses a general/ongoing desire rather than immediacy. For example, ""More and more often it feels like"" and ""I want to"" indicate a recurring thought pattern. There are no time-specific words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""today"" suggesting imminent action, nor any references to past attempts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means), or research are mentioned. The post only discusses the idea of suicide as a way to escape emotional pain, without concrete details on how it would be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions (e.g., starting but stopping an attempt), or self-harm behaviors. The content focuses solely on current feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and hopelessness.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die or commit suicide without specific plans or methods.  

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- ""Kill myself"" is an explicit suicide mention, so IDEATION applies even if the person expresses it as a feeling rather than an intent.  
- No ambiguity between categories; rules prioritize IDEATION when explicit thoughts exist without plans.  
- Focus is solely on the author; no other people are mentioned.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes: ""I really want to check out"" and ""how much I want to check out."" ""Check out"" is a clear euphemism for dying/ending life, especially in context (""unexpectedly checking out would do to others""). The phrase ""even spite has its limits"" implies fading resistance to acting on these thoughts.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Uses ""at this point"" repeatedly, indicating current/ongoing feelings (""running on...spite,"" ""want to check out""). No immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") but emphasizes persistent desire.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research. Focuses solely on the *desire* to die.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""check out"" = death wish) are present ✅  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** mentioned ❌  
   - **No past attempt described** ❌  
   → Matches **IDEATION** criteria (explicit desire without plans/actions).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Check out"" is explicit in context (Rule 1).  
- No method → not BEHAVIOR (Rule 5b).  
- No past action → not ATTEMPT (Rule 4).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains the phrase ""im going to do it,"" which, in the context of extreme distress (""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im in so much pain,"" ""i cant handle it,"" ""im done""), explicitly implies an intention to commit suicide. The farewell message (""thank you to the people... hope everyone finds something to live for"") reinforces this as a death wish. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content, as phrases like ""going to do it"" are included in the framework as expressions of wanting to die when in distress.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The use of ""im going to do it"" indicates current/immediate intent, with words like ""im done"" suggesting urgency. However, no specific timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparation, or research. The phrase ""im going to do it"" is vague and lacks details about how the action would be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on present intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""im going to do it"" interpreted as intent to die).  
   - No plan, method, preparation, or past attempt is described.  
   - Therefore, based on the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""  
   - Critical rules applied: ""Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention"" and ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR only if ANY method/plan mentioned"" (none here, so not BEHAVIOR).  
   - Not ATTEMPT, as no past completed action is described.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses explicit suicidal intent without specifics on method or plan, falling under IDEATION.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""right now"" refers to stress, not the timing of suicidal action. There are no immediate timing indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") linked to suicide, and no past events or general ongoing cues specific to suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The user asks for a ""mostly painless way to kill myself,"" which constitutes seeking information about suicide methods. This is classified under BEHAVIOR, as it involves researching methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current thoughts and inquiries.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"").  
   - A plan/method is implied through the request for method information.  
   - According to the framework, explicit thoughts combined with method research qualify as BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempt is described, so ATTEMPT does not apply.  
   - Since the user is seeking method details, it exceeds IDEATION and falls into BEHAVIOR.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide confirms it's not INDICATOR.  
- Seeking method information triggers BEHAVIOR (per PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT).  
- No completed past actions, so not ATTEMPT.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to method mention.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it.

### Step-by-Step Analysis Using the Framework

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death, such as ""commit suicide,"" ""end it with pills,"" ""result in suicide,"" ""die,"" and ""life over."" However, these references are not about the author themselves. The author is using general or hypothetical language (e.g., ""let's say you do end it"") to discuss suicide methods and outcomes, specifically warning against overdosing. The author does not express any personal desire to die, kill themselves, or end their own life. Phrases like ""I don't want to be alive"" or similar personal expressions are absent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - There are no indicators of current, immediate, or past suicidal actions for the author. The post uses hypothetical timing (e.g., ""let's say you do end it"") and general statements about what ""you"" might experience, but it lacks any personal urgency (e.g., ""I want to die now"") or references to the author's own past attempts. The tone is informational and cautionary, not personal.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses a specific method (overdosing on pills) in detail, including the physical effects and consequences. However, this is presented as general advice or a warning to others, not as a plan or preparation by the author. The author does not mention any personal plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. Critical rule: The risk classification applies only to the person writing the post, not others.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors by the author. The post references what ""you"" might do or what happens in general overdoses, but it does not indicate the author has ever engaged in such actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - The author does not explicitly express personal suicidal thoughts, death wishes, or a desire to die. Mentions of suicide are contextual and directed at others or in hypothetical scenarios. Therefore:
     - No explicit suicide/death wishes by the author → **INDICATOR**.
   - Even though the post discusses suicide methods, this does not translate to personal ideation, behavior, or attempt for the author. The critical rule emphasizes that risk corresponds only to the writer, and here the writer is not expressing personal distress or intent.

**Classification Rationale:**
- The post falls under **INDICATOR** because it discusses suicide in a general, cautionary context without the author expressing personal distress, hopelessness, or explicit suicidal thoughts. The author's intent is to inform and discourage others, which aligns with the INDICATOR category (e.g., no personal explicit suicide mention, even though the topic is related).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal intent: ""im positive im gonna do it"" and ""ill do it when im fed up of this."" The phrase ""do it"" refers to suicide in context, as it is coupled with statements like ""no motivation to keep on living"" and concerns about family sadness. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide/death wishes, even though the wording is indirect.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timing is future-oriented and not immediate: ""gonna do it in the future"" and ""ill do it when im fed up of this."" The user explicitly states ""im good rn"" (right now), indicating no current urgency. This falls under general/ongoing thoughts rather than immediate action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The references to ""do it"" are vague and lack concrete details about how or where the suicide would occur.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post only discusses mental health issues and future intentions, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from Step 1), but there is no plan/method (Step 3).  
   - This fits the IDEATION category, as defined: explicit expressions of wanting to die or commit suicide without specific plans or preparations.  
   - The ""When in Doubt"" rule supports IDEATION since there is an explicit mention but no method.  
   - Not INDICATOR because of the explicit suicide content; not BEHAVIOR due to lack of plan; not ATTEMPT as no past actions are described.

179,I fucking hate my parents for having me. They literally just wanted a baby because 'that's part of life' and it's just resulted in a human being (me) living a life psychologically tortured. They could even find the time to care for me.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post expresses intense distress (""psychologically tortured""), anger at parents, and regret about being born. However, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or phrases like ""want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life."" Terms like ""living a life psychologically tortured"" imply suffering but not an intent to end life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No time-sensitive language (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or references to past/planned actions. Describes ongoing suffering (""living a life"") without immediacy.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   Since there are **no explicit suicide/death wishes** (only distress and existential frustration), this meets the criteria for **INDICATOR**. The post reflects severe emotional pain and hopelessness but lacks any direct reference to suicide or dying.

180,"Dreamt of a group of foreign men, mass murdering people for what seemed like fun. I'm not sure why I dreamt this but I woke up to a severe panic attack. I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post describes a vivid, terrifying dream about mass murder and the user's resulting panic attack and anxiety about sleeping. There is no mention of suicide, self-harm, death wishes, or phrases like ""want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life."" The content focuses on fear from an external threat (the dream) and its emotional impact, not on personal suicidal thoughts or actions.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The user discusses current distress (""severe panic attack,"" ""anxious to sleep"") but these are tied to the dream experience, not to any suicidal intent. No words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to"" suggest imminent suicide risk.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No references to suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The post solely recounts the dream and its aftermath.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. The user mentions the dream as an event, not any real-life suicidal behavior.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die, the post falls under INDICATOR. It expresses distress (panic, anxiety, fear) and life disruption (sleep issues) without crossing into suicidal ideation or behavior.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- No explicit suicide content → INDICATOR per decision logic.  
- Distress and anxiety are present, but no suicide-related language.  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose INDICATOR as there are no suicide mentions.

181,what comes after. i just need something to believe in so i can do it. i don't want to believe theres nothing. ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose. all i saw was fear and despair. please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions related to suicide, such as ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" (where ""do it"" implies suicide in context) and ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" (which equates to wanting to die or end life). Additionally, the phrase ""end this suffering"" is similar to ""want it to be over"" or ""don't want to survive,"" confirming explicit death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language shows current desire (""i just need,"" ""please give me"") but lacks immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The phrase ""so i can do it"" suggests intent to act, but it's contingent on having a reason, not immediate. Past events are clearly stated with ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No current plan, method, or preparation is described. The only method mentioned (""overdosed"") refers to a past event, not current intentions. The current expressions (""do it,"" ""end this suffering"") are vague and lack specifics like a method or location.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt: ""overdosed... once on purpose."" This is a completed action with intent to die, as indicated by ""on purpose"" and the description of the experience (""all i saw was fear and despair"").

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (e.g., ""end this suffering""), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - A past suicide attempt is described (""overdosed... on purpose""), which directly maps to ATTEMPT, regardless of current thoughts.  
   - The critical rules state: ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT"" and ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" Here, the past attempt is the dominant risk factor.  
   - No current plan or method is mentioned, so it does not qualify as BEHAVIOR. The current expressions are ideation-level, but the past attempt takes precedence.

**Final Classification:** ATTEMPT (due to the description of a completed past suicide attempt).

182,I thought I was getting better. for the past few weeks I've been happy just to be spending time with my partner without any bad days. I thought I was finally getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again. I've run out of meds and I asked for an urgent refill a few days ago but my doctors/pharmacy never got back to me. I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I'm suicidal again."" This directly references suicidal thoughts or a desire to die, which falls under explicit expressions of suicide or death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""I'm suicidal again"" indicates a current or ongoing state but does not include immediate timing words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or specific future plans. It suggests recurrence rather than imminent action. There are no past actions described (e.g., ""I tried"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or locations are mentioned. The reference to running out of meds is a contextual detail about their situation, not a description of a planned method or preparation for suicide. The post also does not mention research, acquiring means, or specific setups.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""suicidal again"" implies a history of ideation but not concrete past actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (""I'm suicidal again""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past completed suicide attempts are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicidal thoughts but no plan/method, it falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""I'm suicidal"" is an explicit expression, so IDEATION is appropriate even without intent to act.  
- No doubt between categories: explicit mention rules out INDICATOR, and absence of plan/method rules out BEHAVIOR.  
- Focus is on the author's current state, not others.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   The post explicitly states: ""I want to die more than ever."" This is a direct expression of a death wish, falling under the criteria for explicit suicide/death mentions (e.g., ""wanting to die"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   The phrase ""now I want to die more than ever"" implies current ideation (""now""), but no immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""today"" indicating imminent action. The distress is ongoing but not time-bound.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research. The focus is on emotional pain and relational conflict, not actionable plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   References past struggles (""Everytime I try I fail"") and medication use, but no description of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. The word ""try"" refers to life efforts, not suicide attempts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide thought (""want to die"") is present → Rules out **INDICATOR**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Confirms **IDEATION** (explicit desire to die without specifics).  
   - No evidence of past attempts or active preparations → Rules out **BEHAVIOR** and **ATTEMPT**.

**Critical Rules Applied**:  
- ""Want to die"" is explicit per guidelines, even without the word ""suicide.""  
- No ambiguity: Explicit ideation without plans/methods defaults to **IDEATION**.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide by hanging"" and includes phrases like ""ive alr tied the noose,"" which directly references death and a suicide method. This satisfies the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""ive alr tied the noose"" uses ""alr"" (likely ""already""), indicating a past action. ""im still not sure"" suggests current contemplation but no immediate timing words like ""now"" or ""today.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post specifies a method (hanging) and describes preparation (""tied the noose""). It also involves seeking information about the method (""Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?""), which constitutes research about suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   ""tied the noose"" is a concrete preparatory action. However, it is described as an incomplete step (""im still not sure""), making it an interrupted or preparatory action rather than a full attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (mention of suicide and death wishes).  
   - Specific plans/methods (hanging) and preparations (tying the noose) are described.  
   - This falls under BEHAVIOR, as per the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.""  
   - It is not ATTEMPT because no completed past action (e.g., actual hanging attempt) is described—tying the noose is preparation, not execution.  
   - Critical Rule 3 applies: Interrupted actions like this are BEHAVIOR.  
   - Critical Rule 5: Between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT, choose ATTEMPT only for completed actions—here, it's BEHAVIOR.

Final classification: BEHAVIOR, due to explicit suicide ideation with specific method, preparation, and research.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit phrases: ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die because of them."" Both directly express suicidal thoughts and death wishes.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") are present. The phrasing ""should I"" and ""I want to die"" suggests ongoing contemplation rather than imminent action.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on internal conflict without concrete plans.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No references to past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. The statement ""I've never done anything wrong or illegal"" reinforces no history of actionable behavior.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""kill myself,"" ""want to die"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation described → Rules out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of past suicide actions → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   → Classification is IDEATION (explicit suicidal thoughts without plans/methods).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Should I kill myself?"" is explicitly suicidal, even as a question.  
- ""I want to die"" is a direct death wish.  
- No ambiguity between categories: Explicit mentions mandate IDEATION over INDICATOR; lack of methods prevents BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT classification.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains the phrase ""i just wanna end it,"" which is an explicit expression of wanting to die or end one's life. This aligns with phrases like ""want to be gone"" or ""want it to be over"" from the framework, indicating a death wish in the context of distress.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" uses ""wanna,"" suggesting a current or general desire, but there are no specific immediacy indicators like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to."" It reflects ongoing distress rather than an immediate plan.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., writing notes), or research are mentioned. The phrase ""end it"" is vague and lacks concrete details about how or when.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post references past trauma (""sexuality assaulted me at a young age"") but does not describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions (e.g., no mention of ""I tried"" or actions taken).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""i just wanna end it""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. This fits the IDEATION category.  
   - Critical rules reinforce this:  
     - ""End it"" is explicit in context, so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
     - No method or plan, so it is not BEHAVIOR.  
     - No description of a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.

And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post mentions ""anyone on the brink of suicide,"" which is an explicit reference to suicide, but this is a general statement addressing others, not the author themselves.  
   - The author describes their own experiences: ""felt like I couldn't cope"" and past predicaments, but there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die by the author. Phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" or similar are absent.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - All references are to past events: ""on two of those occasions,"" ""in the past,"" ""has saved me in the past."" No current/immediate indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now.""  
   - The author states they are currently ""a functional member of society,"" indicating no present urgency.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of specific suicide plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations, or research by the author. The discussion of ""going vagrant"" is presented as an alternative to suicide, not a suicidal behavior.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The author describes past actions of going vagrant (e.g., ""hit the road,"" ""living in squats""), but these are coping mechanisms, not suicide attempts or self-harm. No references to past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide/death wish expressed by the author about themselves (only general advice to others), this falls under INDICATOR.  
   - The author expresses past distress (""felt like I couldn't cope"") and life dissatisfaction (""better than the predicaments""), but without explicit suicidal intent, per the rules.  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The suicide risk is only for the person writing the post; the general mention of suicide does not apply to the author.  
- No explicit suicide content for the author, so INDICATOR is appropriate.  
- No doubt between categories, as IDEATION would require explicit personal suicide expressions, which are absent.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""end it"" in the context of distress (""I can't go on anymore""), which is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life. This aligns with phrases like ""ending life"" or ""wanting to die"" as per the framework.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""tonight"" indicates immediacy, and ""I'm just gonna"" (going to) shows current intent to act.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparation (e.g., acquiring means), or research. Being drunk is described as part of the state but not as a method.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""end my life"" and asks about successfully doing so. This is a direct expression of suicidal intent.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The question ""Will I be able to..."" implies current consideration of suicide, though no explicit timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods are detailed: ""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen."" The user also provides physical attributes (weight, height) to assess method effectiveness, indicating active planning and research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past attempts or actions. The focus is on current preparation.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide wish (""end my life"") is present → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - Specific methods (codeine/ibuprofen) and research (""Will I be able to..."") are confirmed → Meets BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of a past completed action → Rules out ATTEMPT.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" is explicit suicide content.  
- Providing drug quantities and physical stats constitutes method planning/research (BEHAVIOR).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit expressions related to death or suicide, such as ""resisting the desire to end"" (where ""end"" implies ending life) and ""everyday i ran out ofreasons tokeep myself alive"" (directly indicating a lack of desire to be alive). Phrases like ""i fuckingcant do this anymore"" and ""i cant stand being here any other moment"" reinforce this in the context of distress, as they express a wish to escape life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language suggests ongoing, general distress (e.g., ""everyday,"" ""my whole life,"" ""for the rest ofmy life"") rather than immediate or specific timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). There is no indication of past actions or attempts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The focus is on internal struggles and emotions, not concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""resisting the desire to end"" implies thoughts but no actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (e.g., ""desire to end"" and ""ran out ofreasons tokeep myself alive""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There are no plans, methods, or preparations described, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past suicide attempts are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the classification is IDEATION, as there are explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or methods.  
   - Critical rules applied: Explicit phrases like ""desire to end"" are sufficient for IDEATION even if resisted, and no method pushes it away from BEHAVIOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""commit suicide"" is explicitly mentioned (""will probably commit suicide eventually""). This is a direct reference to self-inflicted death.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""eventually"" indicates a non-immediate timeframe (general/ongoing), not an urgent plan (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparation, or research is mentioned. The focus is on communication about suicide, not execution details.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""commit suicide"") → Rules out **INDICATOR**.

   - Falls under **IDEATION** (explicit death wish without concrete plans).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself."" Phrases like ""end myself"" directly reference suicide or death wishes, which falls under explicit suicide content. This is not implicit or vague; it clearly expresses a desire to die, even if it's attributed to voices.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""keep telling me"" indicates ongoing, persistent thoughts (general/ongoing), but there are no specific timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" suggesting immediate action. The focus is on recurring intrusive thoughts rather than imminent plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., writing notes), or research. The expression ""end myself"" is vague and lacks concrete details about how or when it might happen.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post describes past financial mistakes and hiding problems, but there is no reference to past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The word ""tried"" is used in the context of concealing issues (""I've tried to keep my problems hidden""), not related to suicide actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""end myself""), but no plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. According to the rules, this fits IDEATION.  
   - The intrusive thoughts (""voices... telling me to just end myself"") align with the critical rule: even if the person expresses ambivalence (""I wanna see my daughters grow up""), explicit suicide mentions still classify as IDEATION.  
   - No evidence of BEHAVIOR (no plan/method) or ATTEMPT (no past actions). Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen due to the explicit death wish.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains the phrase ""maybe i don't need to die,"" which explicitly mentions ""die."" However, this is phrased as a negation (""don't need to die"") and reflects a rejection of the idea of dying, not an expression of wanting to die or end life. There are no other mentions of suicide, killing self, ending life, or similar explicit wishes. The overall context is hopeful (""a hopeful thought,"" ""i can be okay,"" ""i hope i can have that one day"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**

   - No mention of specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. The reference to ""look up ways to try to help me with my mental health stuff"" is about seeking support, not suicide methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - The post includes an explicit mention of ""die"" but not as a wish or desire; it is a statement rejecting the need for death. Therefore, it does not qualify as an explicit expression of wanting to die (which would trigger IDEATION).  
   - The content focuses on distress (""i'm not okay right now"") and life challenges (abusive ex, mental health struggles) without explicit suicidal intent, falling under INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method or past attempt is present, ruling out BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.  
   - Critical rule application: When in doubt between INDICATOR and IDEATION, choose IDEATION only if there is an explicit death/suicide wish. Here, there is no such wish— the mention is negated and hopeful—so INDICATOR is appropriate.

194,hi i dont wanna die rn i just came here bc i thought some of u would know something about this so. can you die from taking 3 xanax pills? i dont think thats possible i just wanna be calm rn because im bored and when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there. and dont tell me not to do this bc i will do it anyway i just wanna know what is the worst thing that can happen to me,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts""  
   - Uses death-related phrases: ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?""  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current action: ""i will do it anyway"" (taking pills now)  
   - Ongoing ideation: ""suicidal thoughts are always there""  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: taking pills (""3 xanax pills"")  
   - Preparation: Declares intent to proceed regardless of advice (""i will do it anyway"")  
   - Seeks risk information: ""what is the worst thing that can happen""  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No past attempts described. Focuses on immediate planned action.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts (IDEATION threshold met)  
   + Specific method (Xanax pills), preparation (declared intent to take pills), and information-seeking about outcomes → Elevates to **BEHAVIOR**  
   - Not classified as ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.  

**Critical Rule Application:**  
- ""I don't wanna die rn"" doesn't negate explicit suicidal ideation + concrete plan.  
- ""I will do it anyway"" confirms behavioral intent.  
- Pill quantity question constitutes method research.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself."" Phrases like ""kill myself"" directly reference suicide, meeting the criteria for explicit content. Additionally, ""if he is dead"" shows a preoccupation with death, but the key is the personal expression ""I can kill myself.""  
   - The question about self-harm (""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"") relates to self-injury but is not an explicit suicide reference. Self-harm is distinct from suicide in this framework unless tied to suicidal intent, which it isn't here.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The suicidal thought (""i will wait until I can kill myself"") indicates a future intent (""wait until""), not immediate action. Terms like ""tonight"" or ""now"" are absent, so urgency is low.  
   - No past suicide attempts are described; the post focuses on relational guilt (e.g., ""I pushed him away"") and current emotional distress.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide method, location, or preparation is mentioned. The statement ""kill myself"" is general, with no details on how, when, or where.  
   - The self-harm inquiry is about concealing self-injury, not suicide methods. It does not involve research or planning for suicide (e.g., pills, jumping), so it doesn't elevate to BEHAVIOR for suicide risk.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or suicidal actions. The post mentions emotional self-blame but no actions like overdosing or self-harm with suicidal intent.  
   - The self-harm question implies potential future behavior but is not an action taken; it's a query. Self-harm alone is not classified as suicidal behavior under this framework unless part of a suicide plan.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself""), so INDICATOR is ruled out.  
   - No suicide-specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so BEHAVIOR is not met.  
   - No past completed suicide attempt is described, so ATTEMPT is ruled out.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION: explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or methods.  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit content: ""kill myself"" is unambiguous, so IDEATION takes precedence over INDICATOR.  
- Self-harm question: Treated separately; not suicidal under rules.  
- No doubt between categories: IDEATION is clear based on explicit thought alone.  
- Focus on writer: All references are to the user themselves.

196,Im probably going to kill myself soon. I've been feeling a really strong urge to lately and the only people i have in my life dont care. They dont make any effort to keep me around. i just wish i wasn't even born to begin with. life is fucking stupid,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""Im probably going to kill myself soon,"" which includes direct references to suicide (""kill myself"") and death wishes (""i just wish i wasn't even born to begin with"" implies a desire not to exist, but the explicit phrase ""kill myself"" dominates). This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Words like ""soon"" and ""going to"" indicate future intent, but there are no immediate timing indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The phrase ""lately"" suggests ongoing urges, but no past actions are described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post expresses a general intent (""probably going to kill myself"") without detailing how.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The focus is on current feelings and urges.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past completed suicide attempt is described, so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on the rules, this falls under IDEATION (explicit suicide thoughts without plan/method).  
   - Critical Rule 5 reinforces: When between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit mention; between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, no method means IDEATION.

Final classification: IDEATION.

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""plummet to the ground"" and references death with ""corpse,"" indicating a desire to die by suicide. Phrases like ""so tempted to just go"" express an active urge to act on suicidal thoughts.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Words like ""tempted"" and ""just go"" suggest a current or immediate urge, though not tied to a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""). The focus is on present temptation and decision-making.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is described: ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground,"" which clearly indicates jumping from a height as a suicide method. The location (""highest floor"") is also specified.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts or actions. The post discusses a current temptation, not a completed or interrupted event.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., wanting to ""plummet to the ground"" to become a ""corpse"").  
   - A specific plan and method are mentioned (jumping from a high floor).  
   - According to the rules, explicit thoughts + plan/method → BEHAVIOR.  
   - This is not an ATTEMPT because no past action is described, only a current temptation.

**Final Classification Reasoning:**  
The post contains explicit suicidal intent with a detailed plan (method and location), fitting the BEHAVIOR category. Hesitation due to guilt or fear does not change the presence of a plan.

198,"If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he wont feel that bad if I kill myself. Any thoughts?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which directly refers to suicide or wanting to die. This is an explicit expression of death wishes, even though it is conditional (""if I deeply hurt my boyfriend"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to."" The use of ""if"" suggests a hypothetical scenario, not current or imminent action. No past events (e.g., ""I tried"") are mentioned.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are described. The phrase ""kill myself"" is general and lacks details about how or when.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on a potential future action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""kill myself"") are present, so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on the rule ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION,"" the classification is IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Check:**  
   - Explicit mention of suicide (""kill myself"") confirms IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
   - No method or plan to escalate to BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past action for ATTEMPT.  
   - The query is about the poster's own thoughts.

This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit mentions include: ""standing on the ledge"" (implied intent to jump), ""gain the courage [to jump]"", and referencing a past suicide ""someone took their life the same way"". Direct expressions like ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"" confirm suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Ongoing/repeated behavior: ""I go hoping"", ""sometimes for an hour"", ""the last time"". No immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but consistent preparatory actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific method: jumping from a hospital parking garage. Location is explicitly named. Preparations: physically positioning on the ledge repeatedly.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Describes initiated but incomplete actions: standing/sitting on the ledge to ""work up the nerve"". Qualifies as an interrupted attempt (action started but stopped).  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide intent (✓)  
   - Specific method/location (✓)  
   - Preparatory actions (✓)  
   - Interrupted attempt (✓) → Falls under BEHAVIOR per rules (plan + action initiation).  
   - *Not ATTEMPT*: No completed past action (e.g., actual jump).

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as:  
   - ""The first time I tried committing suicide""  
   - ""I have multiple attempts on my life""  
   - ""my death seems to ultimate answer""  
   - ""I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself""  
   These phrases clearly indicate suicidal intent and actions.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current/immediate indicators: ""recently I was arrested,"" ""recently began searching,"" and ""it gets harder everyday"" suggest ongoing distress and recent suicidal behavior.  
   - Past events: ""The first time I tried committing suicide"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life"" explicitly reference past suicide attempts.  
   - General/ongoing: ""I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok"" and ""its getting to the point"" indicate persistent struggles.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods: The post describes using a ""phone charger"" in a past attempt and current ""searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident,"" showing research into methods.  
   - Preparations: The research qualifies as preparation for suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Past attempts: ""The first time I tried committing suicide"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life"" describe concrete past actions with intent to die, such as using a phone charger. This fits the ATTEMPT category, which includes actual actions taken regardless of outcome.  
   - Interrupted attempts: The mention of stopping due to family pain (""every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through"") suggests interruptions, but the core descriptions are of completed actions (i.e., attempts were made).  
   - Self-harm: Not explicitly mentioned, so not a factor.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (ruling out INDICATOR).  
   - Past suicide attempts are described, which directly maps to ATTEMPT per the classification rules (""If describes past suicide attempt → ATTEMPT"").  
   - Current suicidal behavior (researching methods) is also present, but the critical rule states: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""  
   - Therefore, the presence of past attempts (e.g., ""tried committing suicide"") takes precedence, leading to ATTEMPT classification.

Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains phrases like ""more dead inside"" and ""done with everything,"" but these are metaphorical expressions of emotional distress, not explicit mentions of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die. There is no direct reference to suicide, killing oneself, ending life, or not wanting to be alive. Terms like ""dead inside"" indicate feelings of emptiness or hopelessness, not literal death or suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The language reflects ongoing frustration (e.g., ""I dont understand why nobody cares,"" ""Im done being played with"") but lacks immediate or specific timing cues like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It describes past experiences (""found a new best friend,"" ""they just fake everything"") and general feelings of exhaustion, not urgency related to suicide.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. The post focuses on interpersonal issues and emotional exhaustion, not planning or methods for self-harm.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content revolves around social disappointments and personal feelings, not actions taken toward suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (only implicit distress), the classification falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness (""nobody cares about me""), and dissatisfaction with life, but without any suicidal elements. This aligns with the INDICATOR category definition.

**Critical Rules Check:**
- ""Dead inside"" is implicit and metaphorical, not explicit suicide content.
- No doubt between categories: No suicide mention, so not IDEATION; no plan or action, so not BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.
- Focus is solely on the author's emotional state.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal actions: ""jump off,"" ""jump out of my bedroom window,"" and ""do it soon,"" all implying a desire to end life. Phrases like ""hopefully I can do it soon"" express a wish to die, making this explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicates current/immediate timing (""soon""), showing urgency for action in the near future.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: Jumping is mentioned (""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window"").  
   - Specific location: ""bedroom window"" is identified, with details like ""trees and mud below"" suggesting planning to mitigate fear.  
   - Preparations: ""I'm getting more courage"" implies mental preparation for the act.  
   - This constitutes a clear plan with method and location.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts or actions. The post focuses on future intent (""I think I can,"" ""getting more courage,"" ""hopefully I can do it soon""), so no completed or interrupted actions are reported.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from step 1).  
   - Specific plan and method are identified (from step 3).  
   - No past attempt is mentioned (from step 4).  
   - According to the logic: Explicit thoughts + plan/method → BEHAVIOR.  
   - Critical rules:  
     - ""Jump off"" is an explicit method, so BEHAVIOR over IDEATION.  
     - No action taken yet, so not ATTEMPT.  
     - When in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to method mention.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""writing suicide notes."" This directly references suicide preparation and is an explicit mention of suicide-related behavior.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""sometimes depression hits really hard"" indicates recurring/ongoing thoughts (""sometimes""), but no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   ""Writing suicide notes"" qualifies as a specific preparation (listed under BEHAVIOR in the framework). No other methods (e.g., pills, jumping) are mentioned.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts or self-harm actions (e.g., ""I tried to overdose""). The notes are a preparatory action, not a completed attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention: ✅ (""suicide notes"")  
   - Plan/method/preparation: ✅ (notes are preparations)  
   - Past attempt: ❌  
   → Classifies as **BEHAVIOR** per rules: ""Describing preparations (writing notes)"" is explicitly listed under BEHAVIOR.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Writing suicide notes"" is an explicit suicide reference (Rule 1).  
- Preparatory actions (like note-writing) trigger BEHAVIOR, not ATTEMPT (Rule 3).  
- No completed past attempt described (Rule 4).

People dying is funny hope that asshole dies hope i die maybe then ill get a good chuckle fuck me fuck da world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains the explicit phrase ""hope i die,"" which is a direct expression of a death wish. This qualifies as an explicit mention of wanting to die, even in the context of sarcasm or distress. Phrases like ""fuck me fuck da world"" imply self-destructive thoughts but are less direct; however, ""hope i die"" alone meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no indicators of immediate or specific timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""going to""). The phrase ""hope i die"" suggests a general or ongoing desire rather than an imminent plan. No past events (e.g., ""I tried"") are mentioned.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The expression is a wish without any concrete details about how it would be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. References to depression (""i suddenly get all depressed"") are general and do not involve actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""hope i die"") are present, so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION, as it expresses a desire to die without specifics on how or when.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- ""Hope i die"" is explicit, so INDICATOR is ruled out per the rule: ""Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention.""  
- No method/plan, so it does not escalate to BEHAVIOR.  
- The mention of attention-seeking (""maybe i just need attention"") does not negate the explicit suicide content; IDEATION still applies.  
- Focus is solely on the author (""hope i die""), not others.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post ""Ah. Just cut to deep fuck"" mentions ""cut,"" which refers to self-harm (cutting), but there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, wanting to die, or related phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""end my life."" Self-harm is noted in the framework under ACTION HISTORY, but it does not inherently imply suicidal intent without explicit suicidal content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""just"" suggests recent action, but there are no indicators of immediate or future suicidal plans (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The phrasing expresses distress or frustration but not timing related to suicide.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   ""Cut"" could imply a method, but there is no mention of it being part of a suicidal plan or preparation. The post describes an action (cutting too deep) without linking it to suicidal intent or method research.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes a self-harm behavior (""cut to deep""), which falls under self-harm as per the framework. However, this is not described as a suicide attempt (e.g., no indication of intent to die or a completed suicide action). It is presented as an incident of self-injury without suicidal context.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - There is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die.  
   - Therefore, per the logic: ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR.""  
   - Self-harm alone, without explicit suicidal ideation, does not elevate the classification to IDEATION, BEHAVIOR, or ATTEMPT, as these require explicit suicidal content combined with plans, methods, or past attempts.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- No explicit or implicit suicide references (e.g., ""want to be gone"" or similar phrases are absent).  
- Self-harm is a distress indicator but not sufficient for higher categories without suicidal intent.  
- ""When in doubt"" rule: Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION only if explicit death/suicide mention exists—here, none is present.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses distress and self-harm but lacks explicit suicidal content, fitting the INDICATOR category.

The user references others' comments about suicide prevention but does not state any personal desire to end their life, kill themselves, or be dead. Phrases like ""what I'm feeling"" indicate emotional pain but lack specificity about suicide or death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - No indicators of urgency (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"") or timing related to suicidal actions. The post discusses a general ongoing frustration with people's behavior, not current or planned suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. The content is focused on criticizing others, not on describing any plan for self-harm.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post does not reference any concrete actions taken by the user.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (only indirect references to others' comments), the post falls into the INDICATOR category. It expresses distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., frustration with others, feeling misunderstood) without any explicit suicidal content.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**
- **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The distress is implicit, but there are no explicit suicide/death phrases from the user. Contextual references to ""don't do it"" do not constitute personal expression of suicidal thoughts.
- **Intrusive Thoughts:** None present.
- **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, choose IDEATION only if explicit suicide mention exists—here, there is none, so INDICATOR is appropriate.

207,what should i do. i dont really know what i want i kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time if you get me. i struggle to get up i find everything boring my friends are the only thing keeping me going and i dont have many since they all left i get bullied so stopped attending school i dont have good grades idk what i should do haha,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **Suicide Content Identification:** The post explicitly mentions ""i kinda just wanna die"", which is a direct expression of wanting to die. This qualifies as suicide-related content, even with the ambivalence (""but dont at the same time"") as per the rules (explicit death wishes count regardless of stated reluctance).

2. **Urgency and Timing Indicators:** The phrase ""wanna die"" suggests a general or ongoing desire, with no immediate timing indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The context describes chronic distress (e.g., struggling to get up, boredom, bullying) but no urgency for suicide.

3. **Plan/Method Assessment:** No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on emotional state and life problems without detailing plans or means.

4. **Action History:** No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. References to bullying and school avoidance are life stressors, not suicide-related actions.

5. **Decision Logic:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""wanna die"") are present, so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - No past suicide attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.
   - Therefore, with explicit thoughts but no plan, it falls under IDEATION.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including:  
     - ""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now""  
     - ""want to justify dying""  
     - ""thinking about partially planning to die""  
   - These phrases directly reference suicide, ending life, or wanting to die, satisfying the criteria for explicit content.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - The post describes ongoing, general timing with phrases like ""for a while now,"" ""past few months,"" and ""every single day.""  
   - No immediate urgency indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") are present. The focus is on persistent thoughts rather than imminent action.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The author mentions ""partially planning to die"" and explicitly references methods with ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips,"" indicating consideration of suicide methods.  
   - While no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or location is detailed, the discussion of methods and planning constitutes a plan/method mention under the framework.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions. The post focuses on thoughts and planning, not completed actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (ruling out INDICATOR).  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are combined with references to planning and methods (e.g., ""partially planning,"" ""methods""), which meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR (suicidal thoughts + plan/method/preparation).  
   - No past completed actions are described (ruling out ATTEMPT).  
   - Applying Critical Rule 5: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to ANY mention of plan/method.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""better off dead"", ""too scared to end it"", ""hang myself""  
   - Direct statements: ""find a nice little spot to hang myself"" confirms active suicidal intent  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current contemplation: ""now I really don't care anymore"", ""I've been thinking I could...""  
   - No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), but expresses persistent desire  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: ""hang myself""  
   - Location details: ""drive out into the mountains... find a nice little spot""  
   - Preparation implied: planning isolation to avoid intervention  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - References past ideation (""since I was a kid"") but no described attempts  
   - No interrupted/aborted actions mentioned  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide wish (""better off dead"") +  
   - Specific method/location (hanging in mountains) → **BEHAVIOR**  
   - No description of past attempts → rules out ATTEMPT

210,I want to be dead. I don't enjoy anything. I am lonely. I am seeking therapy and taking antidepressants. I am not healing. It is terrible. I don't want to live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **Suicide Content Identification:** The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die, such as ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore."" These phrases directly indicate a desire to end life, falling under the explicit mentions outlined in the framework (e.g., ""wanting to die,"" ""not wanting to be alive"").

2. **Urgency and Timing Indicators:** The language is general and ongoing (e.g., ""I don't enjoy anything,"" ""I am not healing""), with no immediate time references like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The distress is present but not time-bound.

3. **Plan/Method Assessment:** There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research. The post focuses on emotional states and existing coping mechanisms (e.g., therapy and antidepressants).

4. **Action History:** No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The references to therapy and medication indicate help-seeking, not actions taken to harm oneself.

5. **Decision Logic:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from step 1), but there is no evidence of a plan, method, or preparation.
   - According to the classification rules, this fits **IDEATION** (explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods).
   - Critical rules applied: 
     - Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I want to be dead"" is explicit, so it cannot be INDICATOR.
     - No methods or plans mentioned, so it cannot be BEHAVIOR.
     - No past actions described, so it cannot be ATTEMPT.
     - When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit suicide mention.

Final classification is IDEATION based on the presence of explicit death wishes without plans or actions.

211,"its supposed to get better but i want to know when. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm doing everything people say they do to get better but it's just not working. I take care of my body: I workout 5-7 times a week, I sleep 8-10 hrs a night, I eat nutritious meals. I'm part of a prestigious grad program for my field, one that I should be proud of and is undeniably an accomplishment. I volunteer regularly with womens groups and lgbtq groups. I'm on medication and I see a therapist weekly. When I'm sad, I journal, I use DBT skills, I try to fight cognitive distortions. But I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal. People say to wait it out, but its been years. Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts. Its supposed to get better but I just want to know when. I read so many articles and videos and posts about people that have recovered from being suicidal and I just don't get why I'm plagued with this. I'm doing all the same things. Its so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on when I dont even know what else to try at this point. I'm just tired of all of it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" multiple times (e.g., ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts""). These phrases directly reference wanting to die or end life, fulfilling the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timing is described as ongoing and persistent (e.g., ""constantly,"" ""day in day out,"" ""it's been years""), but there are no indicators of immediate action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). This suggests a general/ongoing state, not current urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide are mentioned. The post focuses on coping strategies (e.g., therapy, medication, DBT skills) and frustration with lack of improvement, but there is no reference to how, where, or when suicide might be attempted.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses enduring suicidal thoughts but does not report any actions taken to harm oneself.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from Step 1).  
   - No plan/method or preparation is identified (from Step 3).  
   - No past attempt is described (from Step 4).  
   According to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit mentions like ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" are sufficient for IDEATION, even in the context of distress and coping efforts.  
- No evidence pushes this to BEHAVIOR (no plan/method) or ATTEMPT (no past action).  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen due to explicit suicide content.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post mentions ""depression and anxiety,"" ""lack of motivation,"" and feeling ""fucked up,"" but there is NO explicit reference to suicide, death wishes, wanting to die, or phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or similar. The closest is ""I literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore,"" which expresses distress but not a desire for death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - No urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"" related to suicide. The post focuses on needing therapy and fear of parental judgment, with no immediate or past suicidal timing cues.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The content revolves around seeking therapy, not self-harm.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses emotional struggles but no actions taken toward suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the classification defaults to INDICATOR. The post expresses distress, hopelessness, and life problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, lack of motivation) without crossing into suicidal ideation.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
- Explicit vs. Implicit: Distress is implicit (e.g., ""I can't tell them about my depression""), but no explicit suicide content.
- Intrusive Thoughts: None present.
- Interrupted Actions: None described.
- Past vs. Present: No past attempts mentioned.
- When in Doubt: No explicit suicide mention, so no escalation to IDEATION; INDICATOR is appropriate.
- Risk applies only to the author (21m), not others.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""suicide method,"" which are direct references to suicide and death wishes. Phrases like ""suppress my suicidal thoughts"" and ""idea of a new suicide method"" clearly indicate thoughts about ending one's life, even though the person expresses reluctance (""I really don't want to have to do that""). This meets the criterion for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language is general and ongoing, with no immediate or past action indicators. Words like ""try to suppress"" and ""wish I wasn't like this"" suggest a persistent struggle, but there are no terms indicating current intent (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") or descriptions of past actions related to suicide attempts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is mentioned: using eye drops as a suicide method, inspired by a crime video (""eye drops in his beverages"" and ""idea of a new suicide method""). This constitutes a reference to a concrete suicide method, even though it's framed as an ""idea"" rather than an active plan. According to the framework, mentioning specific methods falls under BEHAVIOR.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses solely on thoughts and ideas, not on any actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (suicidal thoughts and suicide method), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Since a specific method (eye drops) is mentioned alongside the suicidal thoughts, it meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR rather than IDEATION (which requires no method/plan).  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Applying the critical rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because ANY method/plan is mentioned.

I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide note"" and phrases like ""free myself of my problems"" (in context, implying ending life), ""do it this time"" (referring to suicide), and ""decided how and when"" (indicating intent to die). This confirms explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   References to past events: ""a month ago"" for writing the note, planning, and self-sabotage. Current elements: ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" suggests ongoing/renewed intent, but no immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific plans and preparations are described: ""Planned everything out,"" ""Picked a time and place,"" and ""decided how and when."" The suicide note was ""primed and ready to be posted,"" indicating concrete preparations. However, no explicit method (e.g., pills, hanging) is stated, but ""how"" implies a chosen method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Describes an interrupted attempt: ""Then sabotaged myself"" and ""blocking my own shot"" show initiated actions (planning, preparing the note) that were stopped. This is not a completed attempt but an action with intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (suicide note, death wishes).  
   - Plan/method/preparation is mentioned (planning, time, place, note).  
   - The interrupted action (self-sabotage) qualifies as behavior, not a completed attempt.  
   - Rule application: Explicit thoughts + plan/preparation → BEHAVIOR. Interrupted attempts are BEHAVIOR per Critical Rule 3.  
   - Current ""maybe"" statement suggests ideation, but the detailed past behavior dominates classification per framework focus on described actions.

Final classification: BEHAVIOR (due to explicit suicide content with specific plans, preparations, and interrupted action).

I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post describes intense emotional pain, hopelessness (""I feel like utter hell,"" ""I will never be loved""), isolation, and worthlessness (""I am just a stain upon the world""). Phrases like ""the world would not change at all if I were gone"" and ""I am already just a fading memory"" imply passive thoughts of absence/death but **no explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, ending life, or wanting to die**. Terms like ""gone"" are metaphorical and lack direct suicide/death language.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Describes ongoing suffering (""I feel like I will never be loved,"" ""I have felt like an outcast"") and current distress (""I am hanging on by threads""). No immediate/time-bound language (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or references to acting on thoughts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. References to trauma (""my father beat me"") and therapy are contextual but not suicidal actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - **No explicit suicide/death wishes** (only implied hopelessness).  
   - Falls under severe distress without suicidal intent → **INDICATOR**.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""If I were gone"" is implicit, not explicit suicide language.  
- Hopelessness/emotional pain alone qualifies as INDICATOR per rules.  
- No plan, method, or past attempt detected.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""want to die"" and specific actions like ""slit my wrist"" and ""hang myself from a tree."" These phrases clearly indicate suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post specifies a future time (""Tuesday"") with phrases like ""I'm either going to,"" indicating a planned action. There is no mention of past attempts or events; the focus is on imminent future behavior.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods are detailed: ""slit my wrist"" and ""hang myself from a tree,"" along with locations (""broken car"" and ""tree""). The inclusion of ""for my parents to see"" suggests preparation and intent. This constitutes a clear plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The post only discusses future intentions, so this category does not apply.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to die"").  
   - Specific plans and methods are mentioned (e.g., slitting wrists, hanging).  
   - According to the framework, explicit thoughts with a plan/method classify as BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempts are described, so it does not qualify as ATTEMPT.

**Critical Rules Check:**

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions:  
   - ""having a lot of suicidal thoughts""  
   - ""it would be better if I was dead""  
   - ""suicide is selfish"" (direct reference to the act)  
   - ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please"" (metaphor for death)  
   - ""suicide would be better""  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Thoughts are described as ongoing (""often feel,"" ""having suicidal thoughts"") but lack immediate timing cues (e.g., ""tonight""). The robbery anecdote is past tense and unrelated to active planning.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific methods (pills, weapons), locations (bridges), preparations (notes), or research. Barriers like the dog and family are discussed, but these are deterrents, not plans.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The robbery incident was an external threat, not a self-initiated action.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are present (✓ IDEATION baseline).  
   - **No plans, methods, or preparations** described → **IDEATION**.  
   - Rationalizations (e.g., death as ""eternal sleep"") reinforce ideation but don’t imply planning.  
   - Barriers (e.g., responsibility to dog/family) indicate contemplation without progression to behavior.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Suicidal thoughts"" and ""better if dead"" are explicit (Rule 1).  
- No method/plan mentioned → IDEATION over BEHAVIOR (Rule 5).  
- Past robbery event ≠ suicide attempt (Rule 4).

218,"Hotline where they can't track me or call the police to come to me?. Last time I called a hotline just to have someone to talk to (didn't have a method or anything), I ended up having the cops called on me and they came to my dorm room and I got stuck in a psych ward for 3 days. It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" in the phrase: ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there."" This directly refers to the person's desire to die or end their life, which qualifies as an explicit expression of suicide-related thoughts.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The suicidal reference is in the past tense (""it made me""), describing increased suicidal feelings after a past event (psych ward stay). There are no current/immediate indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or explicit statements of present intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on seeking a safe hotline for support, not on planning or methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The past event involves calling a hotline and subsequent police intervention, but this is not a suicide attempt; it is a crisis response where the person states they had no method at the time.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal""), but there is no mention of a plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. Therefore, this fits the IDEATION category, as defined by explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or actions.

**CRITICAL RULES APPLICATION:**  
- Explicit mention of ""suicidal"" triggers IDEATION per rules, even if contextualized in past distress.  
- No evidence of BEHAVIOR (plan/method) or ATTEMPT (completed past action).  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit suicide mention.  
- Risk assessment is solely for the author; no other people are discussed.

219,This is not right. I dont want to live anymore. I just want be by myself.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I dont want to live anymore."" This is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive, which aligns with phrases like ""want to be gone"" or ""don't want to survive"" in the framework. It counts as an explicit death wish.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""anymore"" suggests a general or ongoing state, not immediate timing (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). No past events (e.g., ""I tried"") are mentioned.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are described. The focus is solely on the desire not to live.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses current feelings only.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I dont want to live anymore""), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, ruling out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION (explicit suicidal thoughts without specifics).

**CRITICAL RULES APPLIED:**  
- ""I dont want to live anymore"" is explicit, not implicit.  
- No doubt between categories: Explicit mention confirms IDEATION over INDICATOR; no plan/method prevents escalation to BEHAVIOR.  
- Focus is on the writer (""I""), not others.

220,'If you are actually suicidal and not been attention seeking you would've told no one and just ended it silently so nobody could stop you' FUCK OFF. I FUCKING HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THIS LIKE ARE U JUST PLAIN STUPID. MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP. AND YOU SAYING THAT DOESNT HELP AT ALL AND MAKES ME HATE YOU BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL IF YOU SAY THAT. Everything I do that has something to do with my feelings I get called out for 'attention seeking.'. They don't care. They won't believe it until I die. Then they'll say 'oh why didn't he ask for help' BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT YOU SICK PIECE OF GARBAGE. Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - The post contains references to suicide (""suicidal,"" ""ended it silently,"" ""until I die"") but these are either hypothetical (""if you are actually suicidal"") or reactive to others' statements (""They won't believe it until I die""). The writer expresses rage and distress but does **not explicitly state personal current suicidal thoughts** (e.g., ""I want to die/kill myself""). Phrases like ""I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT"" refer to past help-seeking, not suicide intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - No immediate/current timing words (""tonight,"" ""now"") or past attempt descriptions. References to death (""until I die"") are future hypotheticals framed as others' reactions, not personal plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No mention of specific methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide. The phrase ""ended it silently"" is a critique of others' rhetoric, not a personal plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to overdose""). Mentions of past actions (""I DID [ask for help]"") refer to seeking support, not self-harm.

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - **NO explicit suicide/death wishes** by the writer → Falls under INDICATOR. Distress, hopelessness (""trying to hold on,"" ""nobody cares""), and anger are present, but without direct expressions of suicidal intent or plans. References to suicide are contextual (critiquing others' views).  
   - Per rules: When no explicit suicide mention exists, default to INDICATOR. Intrusive thoughts or personal desires to die are absent.

**Critical Rules Check**:  
- All suicide references are attributed to others/hypotheticals.  
- Focus remains on the writer's emotional pain, not active suicidal ideation.  
- ""They won't believe it until I die"" implies fatalistic thinking but lacks explicit personal intent.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I feel like killing my self every day"", ""this might be my final good bye"".  
   - Death wishes: ""it's all done"", implying finality.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Ongoing: ""every day"" (suicidal thoughts), ""over and over"" (repeated disappointment).  
   - Imminent: ""this might be my final good bye"" suggests immediate intent.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Preparations: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"".  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) mentioned, but concrete preparations documented.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No past attempts described (e.g., ""I tried to""). Mentions past writings (""ive wrote here before"") but no physical actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""killing my self"") AND specific preparations (note, bills, testament) → **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - Preparations qualify as actionable steps (Rule 3: Interrupted actions/preparations = Behavior).  
   - ""Final good bye"" reinforces current intent but doesn’t describe a past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit suicide mention + plan elements (preparations) → BEHAVIOR (Rule 5: IDEATION vs. BEHAVIOR → choose BEHAVIOR if ANY plan/method).  
- All references are self-focused.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""i'm going to kms"" (abbreviation for ""kill myself""), ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon,"" ""I'm about to kms,"" ""keep it all in and kms soon.""  
   - Additional indicators: ""I can't get these thoughts out of my head"" (referencing suicidal thoughts).  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Immediate timing: ""very soon,"" ""soon,"" ""about to"" (though tempered by ""just not yet"").  
   - Persistent thoughts: ""I can't get these thoughts out of my head.""  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, or preparation described.  
   - Self-harm mentioned (""I can't stop cutting""), but this is distinct from a suicide plan.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Past self-harm (cutting) is noted, but no mention of past suicide attempts.  
   - ""I tried"" refers to seeking help, not suicide actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide intent is present (""kill myself,"" ""kms"").  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** described—only general timing (""soon"").  
   - Self-harm (cutting) is ongoing but does not constitute a suicide plan.  
   - **Classification**: IDEATION (explicit desire to die without specific plan/method).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""kms"" is explicit suicide language (Rule 1).  
- No method → not BEHAVIOR (Rule 5).

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""wanna kill myself"" (stated twice), ""shoot myself on the spot"", references to suicide notes.  
   - Death wishes: ""ruin their lives by killing myself"", ""they deserve... the burden of my death"".  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current desire: ""makes me wanna ruin their lives... even more"", ""really wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" (indicating active/immediate urges).  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: ""shoot myself"".  
   - Preparations: ""suicide notes"" (discarded but created).  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No described past suicide attempts. Mentions a discarded suicide note (preparation, not attempt).  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (IDEATION threshold met).  
   - Specific method (""shoot myself"") and preparation (suicide note) → BEHAVIOR.  
   - No completed past actions (rules out ATTEMPT).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Shoot myself"" is an explicit method → elevates to BEHAVIOR.  
- Suicide note constitutes preparation → reinforces BEHAVIOR.  
- Anger toward family doesn’t negate suicidal intent.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit mentions include: ""going to OD today"" (OD = overdose), ""popping all of them at once"", and ""thinking about suicide"". Direct references to self-harm via overdose and suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   ""Today"" indicates immediacy. ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"" confirms ongoing ideation.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific method described: overdosing on a combination of named medications (venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh, inderal). Details include having a month's prescription and intent to consume ""all of them at once"".

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past attempts or interrupted actions. Focus is on current intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains the phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now,"" which explicitly references death or ending life. This is a euphemism for suicide or wanting to die, similar to phrases like ""want to be gone"" or ""ending life"" as per the framework. Other elements like apologies, thank-yous, and farewells (e.g., ""Love you Mom, Dad..."") reinforce this as a suicide-related context.  
   
2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""right now"" indicates current/immediate timing, suggesting the feelings are present and urgent.  
   
3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means), or research.  
   
4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  
   
5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (due to ""The end"" reference), but no plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. According to the framework, this fits IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - ""The end"" is an explicit expression of death wishes, so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
     - No plan/method means it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.

Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I was already suicidal,"" which directly references suicidal thoughts. Additionally, the phrase ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" expresses a clear desire to end life through a violent method, indicating explicit death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The post describes current feelings (""It's late in the evening,"" ""I feel so bad,"" ""this is something different"") but does not specify immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The phrase ""all I want to do"" suggests a present urge but not a concrete timeline for action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - The method ""cutting my god damn throat"" is explicitly stated, which is a specific and lethal suicide method. This qualifies as mentioning a specific method, as outlined in the BEHAVIOR category.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts or actions (e.g., ""I tried to cut my throat""). The reference to ""I was already suicidal"" indicates past ideation but not a completed action, so it does not meet the criteria for ATTEMPT.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal,"" desire to cut throat).
   - A specific method is mentioned (""cutting my god damn throat""), which elevates it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.
   - No past attempt is described, so it does not qualify as ATTEMPT.
   - Based on the critical rules: When explicit thoughts and a method are mentioned, classify as BEHAVIOR. The mention of a method (even without detailed preparations) triggers BEHAVIOR per the framework.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly quotes ""if you want to kill yourself"", which directly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to die. This meets the threshold for explicit suicide content.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No current/past time references (e.g., ""tonight"", ""tried"") or urgency indicators. The quote is presented as a general reflection.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific methods, locations, preparations, or research. The quote is philosophical, not actionable.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""want to kill yourself"") are present → Rules out **INDICATOR**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Rules out **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - No description of a past completed attempt → Rules out **ATTEMPT**.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die or end life, such as ""i always end up wanting to die"" and ""i'm ready to join my dog"" (which implies a desire to be dead to reunite with a deceased pet). Phrases like ""i want to leave earth"" and ""i can't do this anymore"" also strongly suggest death wishes in the context of distress. These are explicit mentions of suicide/death per the framework.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Words like ""now"" in ""now i'm ready to join my dog"" indicate current readiness, but there is no specific immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""today""). ""i always end up wanting to die"" suggests ongoing feelings, not a one-time event.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The expressions are about the desire to die, not how or where it might happen.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to"") or interrupted actions. References to life struggles and hopelessness are present, but no concrete actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""wanting to die""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit death wishes but no plan or action, the classification is IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Wanting to die"" and ""ready to join my dog"" are explicit per the framework, even if metaphorical.  
- No ambiguity between categories: Explicit thoughts without plan/method fall under IDEATION.

He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" This directly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and includes a timeframe (""before Christmas hit"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timeframe ""before Christmas hit"" indicates a past plan (not immediate/current). The phrase ""I had previously made up my mind"" confirms this was a past intention.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location is mentioned. The post describes intent (""made up my mind"") but lacks details about preparations or research.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post does not describe any concrete actions taken toward suicide (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes, or interrupted attempts). The phrase ""I was going to"" indicates intent without action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"").  
   - No plan/method/preparation is described.  
   - No past attempt is described (only intent).  
   → Classification: **IDEATION** (explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans/actions).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""I was going to kill myself"" is an explicit suicide mention.  
- Changed intent (""Now, I know I can't do that"") does not downgrade the classification, as the framework focuses on the presence of suicidal expression.  
- No method/preparation → not BEHAVIOR.  
- No description of a past completed action → not ATTEMPT.

230,"Am I faking my depression?. Ok so for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days. My home life isnt that good. Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""serious thoughts about suicide,"" ""I always think about suicide,"" ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself,"" and ""want to commit suicide."" This confirms the presence of suicidal content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The thoughts are described as recurring (e.g., ""for days"" in February, ""always"" during fights, and ""I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week""). There are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" so this falls under general/ongoing ideation rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user explicitly states researching methods: ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself."" Researching suicide methods qualifies as seeking information about methods, which is a form of preparation under the BEHAVIOR category.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions (e.g., no statements like ""I tried to kill myself""). The focus is on thoughts and research, not completed actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (suicide/death wishes mentioned), so not INDICATOR.  
   - Specific plans/methods are mentioned (researching ways to kill oneself), so this goes beyond IDEATION.  
   - No past completed suicide attempt is described, so not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with method research (preparation) classifies this as BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- The research into methods (""easy painless ways to kill myself"") is explicit and constitutes BEHAVIOR per the framework.  
- Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to the method mention.  
- The user's doubts about faking depression do not negate the explicit suicidal content.

231,Life is useless. I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being. Death and suicide need to be normalized,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""Death and suicide need to be normalized""). This qualifies as an explicit reference to suicide, regardless of the normalization context.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate time references (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past/present action indicators. The tone is philosophical/general.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research mentioned.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention exists → Rules out *INDICATOR*.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Rules out *BEHAVIOR*.  
   - No past suicide action described → Rules out *ATTEMPT*.  
   - Explicit suicide reference without plan/action → Matches *IDEATION*.  

**Critical Rule Application:**  
- ""Suicide"" is explicitly stated, triggering IDEATION per rules (even if contextualized as societal normalization).  
- Intrusive-thought rule doesn’t apply here, but explicit mention alone suffices for IDEATION.  
- No ambiguity requiring escalation to BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT.

232,Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?. To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight. Isn't it just beautiful?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""the thought of death"" and romanticizes it as ""beautiful"" and desirable. It describes death as a state to ""never feel pain anymore,"" ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""to be nothing,"" and ""to let go,"" which directly references wanting to be dead or escape life. This constitutes an explicit expression of death wishes, similar to phrases like ""want to be gone"" or ""want it to be over"" in the framework.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The language is reflective and general, using ""the thought of death"" and hypothetical ""to"" statements (e.g., ""to never feel pain""). There are no immediate indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" and no references to past events. It focuses on an ongoing, philosophical contemplation rather than current intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The content remains at the level of abstract thought about death, with no actionable details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post is entirely focused on thoughts and feelings about death, not actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes (e.g., admiration for death as an escape from pain), which falls under suicidal ideation. However, it lacks any mention of plans, methods, or preparations. According to the decision logic:
     - Explicit suicide/death thoughts without a plan/method → IDEATION.
   - Critical rules applied:
     - ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": Phrases like ""to be nothing"" and ""to let go"" are explicit in the context of desiring death, similar to ""want to be gone.""
     - ""When in Doubt"": Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, choose IDEATION because of the explicit death mention. No BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT elements are present.

233,"i'm getting my covid test results tomorrow. and i'll be deciding what to do once i get them. i've been feeling like absolute shit for the past few weeks. i've had sore throat, a possible fever, and now i have cough. aside from that, i've been feeling like a fucking outcast from everyone. my dad keeps getting mad at me for the smallest things while my friends basically don't fucking care about me. i'm so fucking tired and i want to reach out but there's literally no one i can go to. i'm literally just stuck in my head and it doesn't help that i'm also sick. all my life i just wanted to feel like i belong somewhere but i never fucking knew where. all i ever wanted was for someone to care about me so that i'd have something to hold onto, something that would give me another fucking reason to live. in the end, i receive jackshit. there's so much going on in my head that i can't even begin where to start or even know how to fix. but now, it all comes down to my covid results. if i'm negative, i'll run away. i'll leave everyone behind and whatever happens to me by then happens, it wouldn't matter anymore. if i'm positive, i'll kill myself. i used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore. i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day. it doesn't fucking matter to me anymore. this is selfish and irrational, i know, but honestly i just want to make one decision for myself for once no matter how fucking selfish it is. my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and death wishes: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself,"" ""committing suicide,"" and ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day."" Phrases like ""don't see another day"" and ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread"" reinforce explicit expressions of wanting to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The timing is immediate and contingent: Decisions and actions are tied to COVID test results ""tomorrow,"" with specific outcomes (e.g., ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself""). Words like ""now,"" ""i'll,"" and ""as long as i don't see another day"" indicate current intent and urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A conditional plan is described: If COVID-positive, suicide will occur using ""any method."" While the method isn't specified (e.g., pills, hanging), the phrase ""any method i can"" implies consideration of means, and the context (e.g., ""it doesn't matter anymore"") shows preparation of intent. This constitutes a plan under the framework.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions. References like ""i used to be afraid of death"" and ""holds me back from committing suicide"" describe past thoughts, not actions. There is no description of interrupted or completed attempts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill myself""), AND a plan/method is mentioned (conditional plan based on test results with intent to use ""any method""). According to the decision logic, this falls under BEHAVIOR. There is no evidence of a past completed attempt, so ATTEMPT does not apply.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**  
- Explicit suicide content is clear, ruling out INDICATOR.  
- The presence of a plan (even conditional) and method mention (""any method"") elevates it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.  
- No past actions, so not ATTEMPT.  
- ""When in doubt"" rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because a method/plan is mentioned.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit mentions of suicide: ""kill myself"", ""kill mslef"", and context of wanting to die (""stop being a burden"").  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Describes a **past action**: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"". Also expresses current desire: ""What shoul i do kill mslef"".  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific method mentioned: overdose (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"").  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   **Completed past action** described: taking pills with suicidal intent (""took... and nothing"" confirms action was taken).  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - Specific method and **completed past action** → Matches ATTEMPT (per rules: ""actual actions taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome"").  
   - Current thoughts (""What shoul i do kill mslef"") don't override past attempt classification.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""I might kill myself"" explicitly mentions suicide.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"")—uses ""might,"" indicating possibility without immediacy.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific methods, locations, preparations, or research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""kill myself"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → IDEATION (per rules: explicit thoughts without plan = IDEATION).  
   - No past attempt described.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""I might kill myself"" is explicit, triggering IDEATION minimum.  
- No method/plan → Not BEHAVIOR.  
- No past action → Not ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I'm going to end it tonight"" and ""I will be non existent in about a few minutes,"" which directly refers to ending life and being dead. This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post uses immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes,"" indicating current/imminent intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is described: ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil."" This is a clear plan involving overdose on medications.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past attempts or actions; the post focuses on future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from Step 1).  
   - A specific plan/method is identified (from Step 3).  
   - This fits the BEHAVIOR category, as defined: ""explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, or preparations.""  
   - It is not an ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described; the post is about imminent future behavior.  
   - The critical rules reinforce this: when explicit suicide thoughts and any method are mentioned, classify as BEHAVIOR.

237,"I can't remember what happened last year and it makes me so physically uncomfortable i want to kill myself. I just remember that I was really miserable. I couldnt stand being at home anymore, but for what reason? I cant fucking remember",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""i want to kill myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal intent. This qualifies as an explicit suicide/death wish.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""i want to kill myself"" is in the present tense, indicating current suicidal thoughts. References to ""last year"" and ""I was really miserable"" are about past distress, but they do not convey immediate urgency (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research. The focus is on the emotional distress and desire, not on how or when it might be acted upon.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes past misery (""I was really miserable,"" ""couldnt stand being at home"") but no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions. The inability to remember details does not indicate any suicidal action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""i want to kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on the rule ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION,"" the classification is IDEATION.

238,"18 and not a day. Its like life wants me to kill myself on my birthday. I had plans for once, and corona ruined them. Now the last resort of my plans is also ruined. And everything is shit. My initial plan was to kill myself anyways on my birthday. I promised myself this after my first failed attempt in October. This was until my friends convinced me to have a little party. Now im sure that life is sending me the message that I should die. I'm not deserving of love or even fun. And life is right. I deserve to die and suffer while doing so. And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""life wants me to kill myself on my birthday,"" ""My initial plan was to kill myself anyways on my birthday,"" ""I deserve to die,"" and ""I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks."" These phrases clearly express a desire to die or commit suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There is a specific future timing indicated (""on my birthday in two weeks""), which shows a plan for action. There is also a reference to a past event (""my first failed attempt in October"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   For the current suicidal thoughts, the post specifies a timing (""on my birthday in two weeks"") but does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or location. The reference to a past ""failed attempt"" implies action was taken, but no details about the method are provided in this post.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt: ""my first failed attempt in October."" This qualifies as a completed past action with intent to die, regardless of the outcome (failed).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end myself""), which rules out INDICATOR.  
   - It also includes a specific timing for future action, but no method is mentioned, which could suggest BEHAVIOR. However, the critical rule states: ""If describes past suicide attempt → ATTEMPT."" Additionally, the ATTEMPT category specifies: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" Since the post describes a past completed suicide attempt (""failed attempt in October""), this overrides the current context and mandates classification as ATTEMPT.  
   - The doubt rule also supports this: ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions.""

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""last suicide attempt"", ""suicidal thoughts"", ""think about death""  
   - Death-related phrases: ""helped me survive"" (indirect but relevant context)  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Past events: ""one month from my last suicide attempt"", ""depressed for 2 years"", ""6 months ago""  
   - Current state: Suicidal thoughts ""are gone"", ""feel really good""  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No current methods, plans, or preparations described. Only references past attempt without details.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Clear past action: ""last suicide attempt"" (completed action with intent to die).  
   - No interrupted actions or self-harm described in present context.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit mention of suicide? Yes (""suicide attempt"", ""suicidal thoughts"").  
   - Plan/method for current state? No (thoughts are gone, no current plans).  
   - Past completed attempt? Yes (""last suicide attempt"" is a concrete past action).  
   - **Critical Rule:** ATTEMPT category takes precedence when any past completed attempt is described, regardless of current mental state.  

**Classification Rules Applied:**  
- ""ATTEMPT"" is triggered by the explicit description of a past suicide attempt (completed action).  
- Current improvement (""thoughts are gone"") doesn't change classification of the historical event.  
- No ambiguity: The post directly states a past attempt.

I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post mentions ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"" and ""drowning in these awful thoughts,"" but there is no explicit reference to suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (e.g., no phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""want to be dead""). The term ""hurt myself"" could imply self-harm but is not explicitly suicidal, and ""awful thoughts"" is vague without specification.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - There are no indicators of immediate or current suicidal intent (e.g., no words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to""). References to ""today"" relate to non-suicidal activities (e.g., trying to go out), and distress is described as ongoing (""I've been drowning"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - The person explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself,"" and there is no mention of specific methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions. The phrase ""I tried to go out of the house"" refers to a daily activity, not a suicidal behavior.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - No explicit suicide/death wishes are present, so based on the rule ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR,"" this falls under INDICATOR.
   - The post expresses distress (e.g., ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""I'm so tired""), hopelessness (e.g., ""I don't have anyone I can reach out to""), and guilt, but without explicit suicidal content. This aligns with the INDICATOR category definition.

**Critical Rules Applied:**
- Explicit vs. Implicit: Vague references like ""awful thoughts"" or ""hurt myself"" are not explicit for suicide.
- When in Doubt: No explicit mention, so no escalation to IDEATION.
- Focus on the writer: All content pertains to the author, not others.

This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases found: ""I want to die"", ""I haven't died because..."", ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time"".  
   - These directly express death wishes and suicidal thoughts.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""Every fucking day all the fucking time"" indicates ongoing, persistent thoughts without immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned.  
   - Self-harm imagery (""amputating parts of my body"", ""burning myself"") is described as intrusive thoughts (""imagine myself""), not plans.  
   - Explicitly states: ""I’ve never purposely hurt myself"".  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**

   - Explicit suicide thoughts present (""want to die"", ""think about dying"").

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly expresses a death wish: ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight."" This is a direct reference to wanting to die, even if it is passive (hoping for death rather than active self-harm). Phrases like ""hoping to die"" or ""want to be gone"" qualify as explicit suicide/death content under the framework.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""tonight"" indicates current/immediate timing, showing the desire is present and urgent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of a specific suicide method, plan, preparation, or location. The reference to dying ""in my sleep"" is passive and does not involve any actionable steps or methods (e.g., pills, weapons, or research).

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (death wish), but there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned.  
   - Therefore, based on the rules: Explicit thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - The death wish is explicit (""hoping I will die""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
     - No method or action makes it IDEATION, not BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.  
     - When in doubt, choose IDEATION over INDICATOR due to explicit mention.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions a ""Zoloft overdose"" and states ""it obviously wasn't enough to kill me,"" which directly references suicide and death wishes. This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The action described (""took 6 pills at 11:30"") is a past event, indicated by phrases like ""I took"" and ""wasn't enough."" There is no mention of current or future intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is detailed: overdose via ""6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"" of Zoloft. This shows a clear plan and execution.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post describes a completed past action: taking pills with the intent to die (""wasn't enough to kill me""). This constitutes a suicide attempt, as it involves a concrete action taken in the past with lethal intent, regardless of outcome.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide intent is present (overdose mention).  
   - Specific method and completed action are described.  
   - This matches the ATTEMPT category: ""describes past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome.""

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- This is a completed past action, not interrupted or preparatory (so not BEHAVIOR).  
- No ambiguity; rules prioritize ATTEMPT for past completed actions.  
- Focus is solely on the author's actions.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of not wanting to be alive, such as ""there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up."" This directly indicates a desire to not survive or be alive. Phrases like ""destined to do it"" and ""it's soon"" (in context) imply suicide or ending life, especially when combined with the distress described. The mention of ""hope my plan works"" reinforces this, as ""plan"" refers to the intended action to end life. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide/death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The post includes ""it's soon,"" indicating an impending timeframe for the action, which suggests urgency. There are no past events described (e.g., ""I tried""), so the focus is on current/future intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""my plan"" (e.g., ""Hope my plan works""), which refers to a suicide plan. While no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or location is detailed, the existence of a plan is stated. According to the rules, ANY mention of a plan, even if not specific, qualifies for BEHAVIOR when combined with explicit suicidal thoughts.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is focused on current decision-making and future plans.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (e.g., not wanting to live), so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - There are explicit suicidal thoughts AND a mentioned plan (""my plan""), so it meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR.
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.
   - Critical rule applied: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if any plan is mentioned.

Final classification: BEHAVIOR, due to explicit suicidal intent combined with the reference to a suicide plan.

245,Hopeless. I've felt hopeless for months. I'm unemployed. At first I brushed it off due to the pandemic but now months later i realize it's me. I can deal with difficulties in life but realizing you're hopeless is too much. I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better. I just want to find an actual suicide forum.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step-by-Step Analysis Using the Framework

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the phrase ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum."" This directly references suicide-related content. Even though the person does not state a personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to kill myself""), the explicit use of ""suicide"" in the context of seeking a forum indicates engagement with suicide themes. Phrases like ""suicide forum"" fall under seeking or researching suicide, which is covered in the framework as an explicit mention.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The post describes ongoing distress with phrases like ""I've felt hopeless for months,"" indicating general/ongoing issues. There are no immediate urgency indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") related to suicidal actions. The desire to find a suicide forum is current (""I just want""), but it does not specify imminent plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - The key element is ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum."" This constitutes research or seeking information about suicide methods, as suicide forums often discuss methods, plans, or preparations. The framework explicitly includes ""seeking information about suicide methods"" under BEHAVIOR.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors (e.g., no references to ""I tried"" or actions like overdosing). The content focuses on current feelings and intentions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide content is present (via ""suicide forum""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - Since there is explicit suicide content (seeking a suicide forum) AND an element of research/seeking (a form of preparation), this meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR. The framework states: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR,"" and ""seeking information about suicide methods"" is part of BEHAVIOR.
   - There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**
- **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Suicide forum"" is an explicit reference to suicide, as per the rule that even indirect mentions in context count.
- **When in Doubt:** Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, the presence of research/seeking (finding a suicide forum) triggers BEHAVIOR. The rule says: ""Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned"" – here, seeking information is part of plan/method assessment.
- The suicide risk is only for the person writing the post, and they are expressing the desire to find a forum.

246,"I tried, I guess. I fucking considered sex work today. Even though I'm disgusting to look at. That's how low my expectations have of getting away from my parents. I just wanted my mother to tell me it'll be okay. Why couldn't I get even that? Idc if no one responds I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die even though I know it's painful idc just want an end",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I'm on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die"" and ""just want an end."" This directly expresses a desire to die and references suicide (""slash my wrists and die"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Phrases like ""on the verge of trying"" and ""idc just want an end"" indicate imminent intent (present-focused urgency). ""Today"" is mentioned but refers to considering sex work, not suicide.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The method ""slash my wrists"" is explicitly stated, including acknowledgment of the pain (""even though I know it's painful""). This specifies both a plan and means.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   ""I tried"" refers to coping efforts (considering sex work), not suicide attempts. No past suicide actions are described.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""slash my wrists and die"") → Not INDICATOR.  
   - Specific method (wrist-slashing) and preparation (""on the verge of trying"") → BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt → Not ATTEMPT.

That is the most bullshit phase I have ever heard. I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone. ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases found: ""I cannot wait to die"", ""at least the pain will all be gone"". These directly express a desire for death to end suffering.  
   - Additional context: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"" implies preparation for death.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""Cannot wait to die"" suggests ongoing desire but lacks immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or locations mentioned.  
   - Funeral costs indicate logistical preparation but not a suicide method.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts or self-harm actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit death wish (""cannot wait to die"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No method/plan details → Rules out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past suicide actions → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - Classification: IDEATION (explicit desire to die without method/plan).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Cannot wait to die"" is explicit per Rule 1.  
- Funeral costs are post-death logistics, not suicide preparation (Rule 3).  
- No ambiguity between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR (Rule 5).

248,"if life won't ever be as good again, what's really the point?. does anybody have some wisdom to share about the following dilemma:. the summer of my life is over. i have enjoyed perfect happiness. everything that made my happiness has now left me. i'm destined to live a depressed life because i can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past. (Forgive me if I am being egoic / self-indulgent)",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post expresses hopelessness (""life won't ever be as good again,"" ""what's really the point?""), depression (""destined to live a depressed life""), and dissatisfaction with life, but there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (e.g., no phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""want to die,"" or similar). The language is focused on existential despair and perceived loss of happiness, not on ending life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - No indicators of current/immediate intent (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""going to""). The post references past happiness (""summer of my life is over,"" ""enjoyed perfect happiness"") and future hopelessness (""can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful""), but it is general/ongoing in nature (e.g., ""destined to live a depressed life"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. The post is a reflective dilemma seeking wisdom, not discussing plans or actions.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. References are to emotional states, not concrete actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide/death content (only implicit distress), the classification falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses severe distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit suicidal ideation, plan, or behavior. Per the rules, if no explicit suicide mention is present, it is INDICATOR, even with strong depressive themes.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicide-related content: ""jump from a bridge"" and ""highest chance of death,"" which directly reference dying or ending life. Phrases like ""wish me luck hopefully everything pans out the way I want"" imply a desire for death to occur.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post indicates immediate timing with ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend,"" suggesting a concrete plan to act soon (within days).

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods and locations are discussed: ""jump from a bridge"" in NYC, with research on ""which one do I have the highest chance of death."" This shows active planning and method selection, including seeking information to optimize the outcome.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No past suicide attempts or actions are described; the content is focused on future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (jumping for death).  
   - Specific plans/methods are mentioned (bridge jumping, location research).  
   - No past attempt is described; it's future-oriented.  
   - Classification: Explicit thoughts + plan/method → BEHAVIOR.

I supposed to be an alien, I supposed to suffer. This is my place in the world. I am here to live in pain. I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny, right? Do I deserve it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being trapped in pain (e.g., ""I am here to live in pain,"" ""The pain will never loosen it's grip,"" ""I will never be free"").  
   - However, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, wanting to die, or phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""want to be dead."" The statement ""I will never die"" is a declaration of perceived eternal suffering, not a desire for death.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No indicators of immediacy (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past suicide-related events. The language reflects ongoing, general distress (e.g., ""This is my destiny,"" ""I am convinced"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. The content focuses on emotional pain and relational struggles, not actionable plans.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide or death wish, the classification defaults to INDICATOR. The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but lacks any suicidal ideation or behavior.  

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: All expressions are implicit distress, not explicit suicide references.  
- When in Doubt: No suicide mention, so INDICATOR is appropriate.  
- Focus: Only the author's perspective is considered.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions related to death and suicide. Key phrases include:  
   - ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"" (explicit wish for death)  
   - ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from"" (metaphorical but clear reference to eternal sleep/death, in context of distress)  
   - ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" (direct mention of suicide).  
   Even though the person states protective factors (e.g., not acting due to parents), the explicit death wishes are present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current/immediate: Phrases like ""like today"" and ""now I find myself in a different place"" indicate the suicidal feelings are present and ongoing.  
   - Past events: References ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" and the sister's suicide.  
   - General/ongoing: ""When I think about what the rest of my life will entail"" and ""other days, like today"" show persistent thoughts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific plan, method, preparation, or research for current suicidal thoughts is mentioned. The person contemplates death as a ""welcome end"" but describes no actions, means, or locations.  
   - The past ""aborted attempt"" involves a method, but it is historical, not current.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Describes a past ""aborted attempt at suicide,"" which was interrupted or not completed (not a full attempt). This falls under interrupted attempt/behavior historically.  
   - No current self-harm or suicide-related actions are described.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (e.g., ""welcome end to everything""), so not INDICATOR.  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are current but without any specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned (only general ideation and historical behavior).  
   - The past ""aborted attempt"" is an interrupted action, classified as BEHAVIOR historically, but it does not indicate current behavior.  
   - No current plans or methods align with BEHAVIOR, and no completed past attempt is described for current classification (the aborted attempt was not completed).  
   - Applying critical rules:  
     - Explicit death wishes confirm suicide content, so IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
     - No current method/plan mentioned, so IDEATION over BEHAVIOR (when in doubt, choose BEHAVIOR only if any method/plan is present; none here).  
     - Past aborted attempt is not a completed action, so not ATTEMPT.  
   Final classification: IDEATION, as the post expresses current suicidal ideation without specific plans or methods.

There's no emotion anymore. No sadness, its just nothing. The pain in numb now, but that's nothing new. I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess. I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit references to suicide or death wishes: ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" (where ""it"" contextually means suicide, given phrases like ""its for the best"" and the overall tone of hopelessness).  
   - Also, statements like ""There's no hope anymore"" and ""No matter how hard I struggle"" imply distress, but the explicit phrase ""doing it"" confirms a death wish.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" are present. The phrase ""I plan on doing it"" indicates future intent, but not an imminent timeline.  
   - No past events (e.g., ""I tried"") are described, only future plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method and location are mentioned: ""in the tub,"" which implies a suicide method (e.g., drowning or other means), and the rationale ""there will be less of a mess"" shows preparation and consideration of the method.  
   - No explicit details on acquiring means or research, but the specificity of the location and cleanup consideration qualifies as planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The references to past actions (""I graduated,"" ""I did everything right"") relate to life events, not suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I plan on doing it"").  
   - A specific plan/method is included (""in the tub"").  
   - No past attempt is described.  
   - Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR based on explicit thoughts + plan/method.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I plan on doing it"" is explicit in context.  
- When in Doubt: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, the method mention solidifies BEHAVIOR.  
- Focus is solely on the author, with no past attempt.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post states, ""I just want the pain to go away."" There is no explicit mention of suicide, death, wanting to die, or related phrases (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""be dead""). The expression focuses on emotional pain and a desire for comfort (""Can someone just hug me please""), but it does not reference suicide or death explicitly.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No urgency indicators like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to"" are present. The language is general, expressing ongoing distress without time-specific intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, locations, or research. The post is solely about seeking emotional support.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is about current feelings, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the post falls under INDICATOR according to the classification rules. It expresses distress and a desire for pain relief but lacks any suicidal content.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: ""Want the pain to go away"" is an implicit expression of distress, not an explicit suicide/death wish.  
- When in Doubt: No explicit suicide mention, so INDICATOR is chosen over IDEATION.  
- Focus on the author: Only the poster's feelings are described.

I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" ""End it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide/death wishes.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   ""GOING TO"" implies future intent but lacks immediate timing markers (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). References to past trauma and ongoing struggles (""i havent had a full night sleep since forever"") suggest chronic distress, not imminent action.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. References to ""Taking pain killers and antidepressants... to cope"" describe past self-medication for distress, not active planning for suicide.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Past medication misuse (""led to my addiction"") caused physical harm (liver damage, vomiting), but this is framed as maladaptive coping, not a suicide attempt. No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to overdose to die"").  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide intent (""GOING TO END IT"") is present → Not INDICATOR.  
   - No current plan/method/preparation described → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - Past medication misuse lacked stated suicidal intent → Not ATTEMPT.

Fuck everything.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""I really want to fucking kill myself"" and references to ""suicidal thoughts"" returning. It also includes the phrase ""let a train crush my head,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The suicidal thoughts are described as current and recurring (e.g., ""now they're coming back,"" ""I'm thinking about""). There is no specific immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), but the language indicates present distress and contemplation.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific plan and method are mentioned: ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" This includes a concrete location (train station) and method (train tracks).

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is mention of past self-harm (""I feel like cutting myself again""), but this is not described as a past suicide attempt. The post references ""getting over suicidal thoughts"" but no actual past suicide attempts (e.g., no description of a completed action like an overdose or hanging).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""I really want to fucking kill myself"").  
   - A specific plan and method are described (train station and tracks).  
   - No past completed suicide attempt is indicated.  
   - Therefore, based on the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.""  
   - Self-harm (""cutting myself"") is noted but does not change the classification, as it is not a past suicide attempt and the current plan dominates the risk.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit suicide content is clear.  
- The plan/method (train tracks) triggers BEHAVIOR classification.  
- No past attempt, so not ATTEMPT.  
- Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to the method mention.  
- Focus is solely on the author's current state.

The only times I have been happy the past few years has been to alter my state of reality, so that the 24/7 intrusive thoughts can't find a way in. If I am forced to live then put me on a thorazine dri0 so I can be a zombie until the world lets me die.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""I have wanted to die,"" ""I should be able to kill myself,"" and references to death (""the world lets me die""). This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""Every day for 4,808"" indicates an ongoing, persistent desire to die, but there are no specific immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" suggesting imminent action. The focus is on chronic ideation rather than acute urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of a current specific suicide plan, method, preparation, or research. The references to ""thorazine drip"" and ""alter my state of reality"" relate to escaping intrusive thoughts through medication or substance use, not suicide methods. No locations, means, or preparations are described for a current suicide attempt.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts: ""I had a few suicide attempts"" and details one ""successful attempt"" where the person was saved. This qualifies as a description of completed past actions with intent to die, regardless of outcome (interrupted or not).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""wanted to die,"" ""kill myself""), but no current plan or method is mentioned, which would typically point to IDEATION.  
   - However, the post describes past suicide attempts, which directly triggers the ATTEMPT category per the classification rules (""If describes past suicide attempt → ATTEMPT"").  
   - Critical rules reinforce this:  
     - Past vs. Present: The description of past attempts is clear and detailed, and while current ideation is expressed, the focus on past actions takes precedence for classification.  
     - Rule for ATTEMPT: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT"" – here, past attempts are mentioned alongside current ideation, but no current plans are present. Since the post describes past attempts, ATTEMPT applies regardless of current ideation.  
   - There is no ambiguity between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT because BEHAVIOR requires current plans/methods, which are absent, and ATTEMPT is explicitly for described past actions.

257,"Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real. Nothing in my life feels real. I think it's all a dream. A dream we are all so desperately attached too. Nothing about it feels real.

I feel shame for failing.

And all the people who've abandoned me, lied to me, got sick of me have proven that time and time again. I can barely gather the strength to speak to anybody or to respond to the messages I have, or to start conversations with anybody, I know they don't care. Or even if they do now, they won't eventually. Fuck me",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicide multiple times, including phrases like ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""trying to end my own life,"" and ""shame for failing."" This constitutes clear expressions of suicidal intent and death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The user references past actions (""I feel shame for failing"") and expresses current intent with vague timing (""tomorrow maybe,"" ""next week,"" ""next month""). While not immediate, this indicates ongoing suicidal thoughts and plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The user describes a specific plan for a future attempt: ""this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of,"" with references to potential hospitalization and ""math"" (implying calculations, e.g., for dosage). This shows preparation and method consideration, though not explicitly named.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The user explicitly describes a past suicide attempt: ""I feel the pain of trying to end my own life"" and ""shame for failing,"" indicating a completed action with intent to die, regardless of outcome. This is a concrete past attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (e.g., ""Trying to kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There is a plan/method mentioned for future action, so it cannot be IDEATION alone.  
   - A past suicide attempt is described (""shame for failing""), which meets the criteria for ATTEMPT.  
   - Critical Classification Rule: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" This applies here, as the user references both a past attempt and current plans.  
   - Therefore, the classification is ATTEMPT, as it describes a completed past action with intent to die.

258,Satanic Groundhog day. A day feels like a month. Brain really hurts. No income. Nothing to do. Reminded every second of others successes. Even as I type this. No bueno. I used to feel entertained and not in hell watching Judge Judy and Heidi Klum. Nope. I hate everything. No money will rot your brain. It's over. All I want is courage to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""All I want is courage to end it"" explicitly references ending one's life. ""End it"" is a direct euphemism for suicide, especially in context with expressions of despair like ""It's over"" and ""I hate everything.""  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The desire (""All I want"") is present-tense but lacks immediate time-bound urgency (e.g., ""tonight""). The distress is ongoing, not tied to a specific imminent timeline.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research. The phrase focuses solely on lacking ""courage"" to act, not concrete plans.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No references to past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wish (""end it"") is present → Rules out **INDICATOR**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Rules out **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - No description of a past completed attempt → Rules out **ATTEMPT**.  
   - Explicit suicidal thought without plan → **IDEATION** per framework.  

**Critical Rule Application:**  
- ""End it"" is explicit under the framework (similar to ""want to be gone"").  
- No ambiguity between categories: Explicit ideation without plan/method.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""I'm going out of this world,"" ""I'm not worth living,"" ""I'm offing myself,"" and ""Goodbye world."" Phrases like ""offing myself"" are direct references to suicide, satisfying the criteria for explicit content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post specifies a concrete date and time for the action: ""April 13, 2021"" at ""13:14 hours."" The language ""I'm going out... at that time"" and ""I'm offing myself then"" indicates a planned, immediate future action, showing urgency and timing.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   While no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, the identification of a precise date and time constitutes a specific plan or preparation. This aligns with the BEHAVIOR category, which includes ""specific plans"" or ""preparations.""

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes a future intent (""I'm going to"") rather than a past action. There is no mention of previous attempts or self-harm behaviors, so this does not qualify as ATTEMPT.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (ruling out INDICATOR).  
   - A specific plan (date and time) is mentioned, so this is not IDEATION (which lacks plans/methods).  
   - The post describes future intent with preparation, so it falls under BEHAVIOR.  
   - It is not ATTEMPT, as no past completed action is described.  
   - Critical Rule 5 applies: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because a specific plan (timing) is mentioned.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit suicide/death references:  
   - ""I dont want to live""  
   - ""I just want to die peacefuly""  
   - ""I want to kill myself so bad""  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Uses present-tense urgency: ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" ""It will never be better"" (current hopelessness).  
   - No immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (pills, hanging, etc.), locations, or preparations described.  
   - Mentions drinking (""get drunk"") but frames it as coping, not a suicide method.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts or self-harm actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I overdosed"").  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to kill myself"").  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** described.  
   - **No past attempt** mentioned.  
   → Classification: **IDEATION** (explicit death wishes without plan/action).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""I want to kill myself"" is explicit, triggering IDEATION minimum.  
- Intrusive thoughts (""my brain tells me..."") not present, but explicit wish suffices.  
- No method → not BEHAVIOR; no past action → not ATTEMPT.  
- Distress about life/rejection supports context but doesn’t override explicit suicide statements.

261,"Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me. I just can't do this anymore, all the upset and pain and hurt I cause. I have to make it stop.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post says: ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" and ""I have to make it stop."" These phrases imply hopelessness and a desire to end suffering, but there is no explicit mention of suicide, death, or wanting to die (e.g., no words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die,"" ""end my life,"" or equivalent explicit phrases such as ""want to be gone"" or ""don't want to survive""). While the sentiment suggests the person feels like a burden, it does not cross into explicit suicidal content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No indicators of urgency (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past events (e.g., ""I tried""). The phrase ""I just can't do this anymore"" suggests ongoing distress but no specific timing related to suicide.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or locations.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die, the post falls into INDICATOR. It expresses distress, hopelessness, and feelings of causing pain, which aligns with the INDICATOR category (general dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal content).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I would have done it already"" (where ""it"" contextually means suicide), ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it"", and ""nothing is better than this"" implying death as relief.  
   - Direct references to suicide intent: Fear of ""botching it and ending up seriously hurt"" confirms ""it"" = suicide attempt.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current distress: ""I’m on the edge,"" ""I can’t do this,"" and ""I would have done it already"" indicate immediate suicidal urgency.  
   - No past attempts described (""I would have done it"" is hypothetical, not actual).  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, or preparations mentioned.  
   - Only general fear of ""botching it"" implies consideration of methods but lacks concrete details.

I feel like I'm a failure to my son, my parents, and everyone around me. Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts: ""I would say I'm suicidal"" and expresses death wishes like ""I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""Why am I even here,"" and ""I serve no purpose but only suffer."" These are clear expressions of wanting to die or end life, even if qualified with reasons not to act immediately.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The suicidal thoughts are future-oriented (""I will wait till he's an adult,"" ""11 more years"") and not immediate. There are no indicators of current plans (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The user also states, ""I don't have the balls to actually do it,"" reducing urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The reference to waiting 11 years is a general timeline, not a detailed plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The phrase ""I have tried"" refers to life efforts (e.g., motivation, jobs), not suicide-related actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm suicidal""), but there is no evidence of a plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, based on the rules, this falls under IDEATION. The lack of current action or method outweighs the future-oriented thoughts, and there is no past attempt.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I just want off this life,"" which directly expresses a desire to escape or end life. This is similar to phrases like ""want to be gone"" or ""not wanting to be alive,"" as outlined in the framework. It is an explicit expression of death wishes in the context of distress.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post describes ongoing feelings (""for years & years"") with no immediate time references (e.g., ""today"" or ""now""). The phrase ""struggling to hold on"" suggests persistent distress but no current/immediate intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The focus is on the desire to escape life without concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is solely about current emotional states.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""want off this life"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is indicated.  
   - According to the rules, this fits IDEATION (explicit thoughts without specific plans).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I need to kill myself"" and ""me killing myself,"" which are direct references to suicide and death wishes. This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no specific time-bound words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""today."" The language (""I need to kill myself,"" ""life just isn't worth it"") suggests ongoing distress rather than immediate intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post includes a question about minimizing harm to others (""how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends""), but this does not describe a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparation, or research into methods. The query is focused on consequences, not the act itself, so it does not meet the criteria for a plan or method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is entirely focused on current thoughts and feelings.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I need to kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is described, so it does not qualify as BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicide thoughts but no plan/method, it falls under IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide rules out INDICATOR.  
- The question about minimizing harm is not equivalent to seeking information about methods, so it does not elevate to BEHAVIOR.  
- No doubt between categories; IDEATION is clear based on explicit thoughts without specifics.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains the phrase ""By this time next week I'll be gone,"" which explicitly expresses a wish to be dead or not alive. This is similar to phrases like ""want to be gone"" or ""going to die"" in the context of distress, as the user describes hopelessness (""no possible way to turn my life around""), exhaustion (""tired of fighting""), and being trapped in a cycle. This qualifies as an explicit mention of death/suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""By this time next week"" indicates a specific future timing (not immediate like ""today"" or ""now""), suggesting intent but not immediacy. Other phrases like ""constantly"" reflect ongoing distress but do not change the primary classification.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging), location (e.g., bridge), preparation (e.g., writing a note), or research is mentioned. The statement is general and lacks concrete details about how the user plans to act.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The user references depression and being ""stuck"" in memories but no actions related to suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I'll be gone"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is described.  
   - No past attempt is indicated.  
   Therefore, based on the rules:  
   - If explicit suicide thoughts exist without a plan/method → **IDEATION**.  
   - The ""When in Doubt"" rule supports IDEATION over INDICATOR due to the explicit death mention, and there is no basis for BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT since no method or past action is described.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""I don't want to survive another attempt"" refers to a suicide attempt, and ""I just want to die"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""Another attempt"" indicates a past event, as it references a previous suicide attempt. ""I don't want to survive another attempt"" suggests a general/ongoing desire but lacks immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific plan, method, preparation, or location for a future attempt is mentioned. The focus is on the outcome (not surviving) rather than current planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The phrase ""another attempt"" explicitly describes a past completed suicide attempt (e.g., the person survived a previous attempt, but it was an actual action taken with intent to die).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""I just want to die""), but the key factor is the description of a past suicide attempt (""another attempt""). According to the rules, any mention of a past completed suicide attempt classifies as ATTEMPT, regardless of current thoughts or plans. There is no specific current plan or method described, so this is not BEHAVIOR. The presence of the past attempt overrides IDEATION.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The focus is on thoughts, not actionable plans.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**

I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**

There are no current or immediate indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The user states they are in a ""tenuously better situation right now,"" indicating the risk is not present.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The user references a specific method (though not detailed) and describes preparations: ""testing my method,"" going ""until shortly before the point of no return,"" and evaluating if it ""worked like it was supposed to."" This implies a plan and method assessment, even if the method isn't named.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The user describes interrupted actions: for the first event, they stopped ""shortly before the point of no return"" to test the method; for the second, they ""stopped myself"" despite the intention to die. These are not completed attempts but involve initiated actions that were halted. Per the rules, interrupted actions like this qualify as behavior (not attempt).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (suicidal thoughts and death wishes), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There is evidence of a plan/method (testing and preparing), so it cannot be IDEATION.  
   - The actions were interrupted and not completed, so it does not meet the criteria for ATTEMPT (which requires a past completed action).  
   - Therefore, this fits BEHAVIOR: explicit suicidal thoughts combined with specific preparations and interrupted attempts where action was initiated.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Interrupted actions (stopping before the point of no return) are classified as BEHAVIOR.  
- Past vs. present focus: The actions are historical, but BEHAVIOR includes past preparations and interrupted attempts.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: BEHAVIOR is chosen due to method/preparation mention.  
- No current risk is described, but the classification is based on the content provided.  
- The risk pertains only to the user writing the post.

270,"Why exactly should I even have hope anymore? Its evident from my entire life up until now that I was never meant to be happy. I have to learn to not get my hopes up or get excited over shit. Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes: ""I really want to die"" and ""I'd rather die than submit to anyone."" These phrases directly indicate a desire to die or end life, falling under explicit suicide content. Other content (e.g., hopelessness, distrust) is distressing but does not negate the explicit mentions.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language reflects ongoing, general distress (e.g., ""Every time I get my hopes up,"" ""I've been trying for a long fucking time"") rather than immediate plans. No words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" suggest urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The focus is on emotional pain and life dissatisfaction without concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. References to past events (e.g., childhood abuse, bullying) relate to life experiences, not suicide actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I really want to die""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. This fits the IDEATION category. No past attempts are mentioned, ruling out ATTEMPT. The presence of explicit death wishes overrides any implicit content (e.g., ""What do I have to live for?""), so it is not INDICATOR.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit phrases like ""want to die"" are sufficient for IDEATION, even without intent to act.  
- No methods or plans shift this away from BEHAVIOR.  
- No past suicide actions rule out ATTEMPT.  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR and IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen due to explicit mentions.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""contemplating suicide,"" ""looking up how to do it,"" and ""i wish i had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself."" These phrases directly reference wanting to die or end life, including specific methods.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language indicates ongoing distress (e.g., ""6 hours of contemplating suicide"" during school) and a current desire to die (""i wish i had the courage""), but no immediate time-bound words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" are used. The focus is on persistent thoughts rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods are mentioned: ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself."" Additionally, the author describes ""looking up how to do it,"" which constitutes research or preparation for suicide methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried"" or completed actions). The phrase ""looking up how to do it"" refers to preparatory behavior, not an actual attempt. The wish for courage (""wish i had the courage"") implies no action was taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""contemplating suicide"" and death wishes), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Specific methods (""jump in front of a car,"" ""stab myself"") and research (""looking up how to do it"") indicate a plan and preparation, elevating it beyond IDEATION.  
   - No past completed attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific methods/preparations, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

I can't trust anyone, the second I do I get burned. I'm so fucking stupid. Fuck the entire human race. I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all. If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die or not wanting to be alive, such as: ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back,"" and ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all"" (which includes a personal death wish). These phrases align with examples like ""I don't want to be alive"" or ""I wish I was dead,"" indicating explicit suicidal thoughts.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The language expresses general distress and ongoing hopelessness (e.g., ""People always say,"" ""All my life has been,"" ""I hate this so much"") but lacks immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The nuclear bomb wish is hypothetical and not time-specific.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., writing notes), or research are mentioned. The nuclear bomb reference is not a feasible or actionable personal plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses solely on current feelings and wishes.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""I don't want to be here anymore"" is equivalent to ""I don't want to be alive""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. According to the rules, this fits IDEATION. The nuclear bomb wish, while explicit in desiring death, does not involve personal action or planning. Critical Rule 1 confirms that phrases like ""I want to be gone"" are explicit in distress contexts, and Rule 2 states that even intrusive thoughts with explicit suicide mentions are IDEATION. There is no evidence for BEHAVIOR (no plan/method) or ATTEMPT (no past action). Rule 5 resolves any doubt: between INDICATOR and IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit death wishes.

273,It will all be done after I die. I want to die because I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color I'm just going to pull the trigger if a cop doesn't do it first.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I want to die"" and ""I'm just going to pull the trigger,"" which directly references wanting to die and a method of suicide (using a gun). Phrases like ""after I die"" further indicate death wishes in the context of distress.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" uses ""going to,"" suggesting future intent. The addition of ""if a cop doesn't do it first"" implies immediacy or potential for near-term action, but no specific time (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The method is explicitly stated: ""pull the trigger,"" which refers to using a firearm. This is a specific suicide method. There is no mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring a gun) or locations, but the method itself is clear.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions. The post focuses on current desires and future plans.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to die"").  
   - A specific method is mentioned (""pull the trigger"").  
   - According to the framework, this combination (explicit thoughts + method) classifies as BEHAVIOR.  
   - It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described; the language is future-oriented (""going to"").  
   - The ""if a cop doesn't do it first"" clause does not change the classification, as it refers to external factors and not the person's own suicide behavior.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I want to die"" and ""pull the trigger"" are explicit.  
- When in doubt: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, the method mention dictates BEHAVIOR.  
- Focus on the person writing: All statements are about the author.

I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness. Death seems like the only place where I can be free.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" explicitly expresses a desire for death as relief, indicating suicidal ideation.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). References to past self-harm (""two months ago"") and ongoing distress (""tired all the time"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"") is noted, but this is non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) without stated intent to die. No description of past suicide attempts.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit death wish (""Death seems like the only place..."") → Must be at least IDEATION.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - No completed suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Self-harm alone ≠ ATTEMPT without suicidal intent.

I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much.

I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step-by-Step Analysis Using the Framework

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide, such as: ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide,"" and ""I think about suicide every day."" These are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts, even though the person states, ""I know I would never do it."" According to the rules, explicit mentions of suicide or death wishes count, regardless of stated intent not to act.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post describes ongoing, general timing: ""everyday,"" ""every day,"" ""once a week or so,"" and ""it's been like this for seven years."" There are no immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" This suggests chronic suicidal thoughts rather than acute, imminent risk.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The person explicitly mentions ""I write detailed plans in my journal"" regarding suicide. While no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or location is described, ""detailed plans"" constitutes preparation, as defined in the BEHAVIOR category (e.g., ""describing preparations"" like writing notes). This moves beyond mere thoughts to actionable planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions. References to writing in a journal are preparatory and not actual actions taken with intent to die. The post focuses on current thoughts and planning, not past behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (suicidal ideation).  
   - A plan/preparation is also present (""detailed plans"" written in a journal).  
   - Therefore, applying the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.""  
   - The absence of a past attempt rules out ATTEMPT, and the presence of planning rules out IDEATION. The critical rule ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned"" confirms this classification.

**Conclusion:** The post meets BEHAVIOR criteria due to explicit suicidal thoughts combined with documented preparations (writing detailed plans).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains expressions of distress (""I cant take it anymore"") and pain (""The pain is unreal""), but there is no explicit mention of suicide, death, wanting to die, or related phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""be dead."" The language is about emotional suffering, not suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no specific time references (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past event descriptions. The phrase ""I cant take it anymore"" suggests ongoing distress but lacks immediacy.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The content is vague and focused on emotional pain.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses current feelings, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the classification defaults to INDICATOR. The post expresses distress and hopelessness without crossing into explicit suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt.

277,"Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""commiting suicide,"" which directly refers to suicide or ending one's life. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content, as it includes phrases like ""commiting suicide"" even in the context of capability.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no indicators of immediacy (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past attempts. The phrasing ""I think I'm capable"" suggests a general or ongoing state rather than a specific, immediate intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on capability without detailing how suicide might be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is about potential ability, not completed actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""commiting suicide""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of a past completed action, so it is not an ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicide thoughts but no plan/method, it falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide overrides any implicit distress, confirming IDEATION.  
- Capability statements still involve explicit suicide thoughts, aligning with IDEATION definition.  
- No doubt between categories: Explicit mention rules out INDICATOR; lack of method/rules out BEHAVIOR; no past action rules out ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end life, such as ""I just want it to be over"" (likely a typo for ""I just want it to be over"") and ""I wasn't to be down"" (likely a typo for ""I want to be done""). These phrases align with ""want it to be over"" and ""want to be gone"" from the framework, indicating explicit death wishes in the context of distress (e.g., ""I hate every part of my life"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - No immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" are present. The language suggests ongoing distress (e.g., ""I'm sick and tired""), but no specific urgency for imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The reference to being drunk appears to be emotional coping, not a suicide method or plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current feelings, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""want it to be over""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. This fits the IDEATION category.
   - Critical rules applied: ""want it to be over"" is explicit, so IDEATION over INDICATOR. No behavior or attempt elements are present.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" and ""I will use my suicide to disturb people."" This includes direct references to suicide and death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" indicates past events.  
   - ""I will use my suicide"" suggests future intent but lacks immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The phrase ""I will use my suicide to disturb people"" implies a general plan or intent for future suicide but does not specify a method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, locations). It is more about motivation than concrete details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" explicitly describes past completed suicide attempts, which are actions taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - The post includes explicit suicide content (suicide/death wishes), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Past suicide attempts are described (""I have attempted suicide 11 times""), which directly fits the ATTEMPT category (""posts describing past completed suicide attempts"").  
   - Although there is a future-oriented statement (""I will use my suicide""), the classification rules specify: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""  
   - The future statement lacks specific methods or preparations, so it does not elevate to BEHAVIOR on its own.  
   - Therefore, based on the presence of past attempts, the classification is ATTEMPT.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit suicide mentions are present (Rule 1).  
- Past vs. Present focus: The past attempts take precedence (Rule 4).  
- When in doubt between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT: ATTEMPT is chosen for completed past actions (Rule 5).  
- Only the user's own risk is considered.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mention: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"" directly references suicide.  
   - Additional context: ""I just want the pain to end"" implies a desire for relief through death but is secondary to explicit suicide reference.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"" uses past tense (""tried""), indicating historical actions.  
   - No current/immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, or preparations described for current plans.  
   - Past attempts lack method details but confirm completed actions.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Clear past attempts: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times"" confirms completed actions with suicidal intent.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""tried to kill myself"") + past completed actions = **ATTEMPT** (per rules: ""describes past suicide attempt"").  
   - Rule 4: Past actions take precedence over current distress (""I just want the pain to end"").  
   - Critical Rule 5: ATTEMPT classification overrides BEHAVIOR/IDEATION when past attempts are described.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die or end life. Examples include: ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"" and ""End it now"". These phrases directly reference death and suicide, fulfilling the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   The phrase ""End it now"" uses ""now,"" indicating current or immediate intent. Other parts describe ongoing distress (e.g., ""Every morning I wake in pain""), but the immediacy of ""now"" heightens urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   The user discusses specific suicide methods in detail: considering firearms (e.g., ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth,"" comparing ""small caliber or large caliber"" handguns, and avoiding shotgun due to concerns about head explosion). They also mention researching other options (e.g., overdosing, referencing Mark Linkous) and express fears about failed attempts. This shows specific planning and method evaluation.

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   There is no mention of the user's own past suicide attempts. References to actions (e.g., Mark Linkous's overdose) are about others, and the user states, ""I'm nowhere close to dying,"" indicating no personal history of attempts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from step 1), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - Specific methods and research are mentioned (from step 3), so it exceeds IDEATION.  
   - No past completed actions are described (from step 4), so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/methods, it classifies as BEHAVIOR.  
   - Critical rules applied: ""End it now"" is explicit; between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, method mention triggers BEHAVIOR; no past attempt for ATTEMPT classification.

282,Can't do any of it!. Just don't want this anymore just wanna sleep and never ever wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""never ever wake up"" implies a desire for permanent unconsciousness/death, but there are NO explicit terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die,"" or equivalent direct expressions. Metaphorical references to death without explicit suicidal intent fall below the threshold for ideation.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Words like ""anymore"" suggest ongoing distress, but no immediate time references (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or stated intent to act.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - No explicit suicide/death wish → **INDICATOR**  
   - Metaphorical distress (""never wake up"") without explicit suicidal language aligns with severe hopelessness, not active ideation.  

**Critical Rule Application:**  
- ""Never wake up"" is implicit, not explicit (per Rule 1: requires phrases like ""want to be gone"" to count as explicit; this is weaker).  
- No ambiguity between categories; clearly lacks suicide-specific language.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" multiple times, which directly indicates a wish for death or suicide. This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide/death mention, even though the person expresses fear and asks for help.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language reflects ongoing distress (e.g., ""tired of everything,"" ""what's the point"") but lacks immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It describes general feelings rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The focus is on emotional exhaustion without concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is solely about current thoughts and feelings.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to die"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is indicated.  
   - No past attempt is described.  
   - Therefore, based on the rules: Explicit thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules reinforce this: The explicit mention of death wishes overrides any implicit distress, and the person's fear or request for help does not downgrade the classification to INDICATOR. No doubt exists between categories, as the post clearly fits IDEATION.

I will just suffer till I end it. I know where I'll attempt, I know how, I know what I need, I know how and when I can run away from home. I know these things. It must be a Tuesday to run away.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times (e.g., ""I can't stop thinking about suicide,"" ""end it,"" ""I will just suffer till I end it""). Phrases like ""end it"" and ""attempt"" (in ""I know where I'll attempt"") clearly refer to suicide or death wishes, satisfying the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post indicates ongoing thoughts (""I can't stop thinking about it"") and future intent with timing elements (""I know how and when I can run away from home. It must be a Tuesday""). This shows urgency and planning for a specific time, not just general or past references.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** Specific plans and methods are detailed: ""I have a plan,"" ""I know where I'll attempt,"" ""I know how,"" ""I know what I need,"" and ""I know how and when."" This includes preparations like running away from home on a specific day (Tuesday), indicating concrete steps toward suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** No mention of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. The focus is on current plans and future intentions (e.g., ""I'll attempt""), not completed past events.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from Step 1), so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - A specific plan, method, and preparations are described (from Step 3), so it exceeds IDEATION.
   - No past completed actions are mentioned, so it is not ATTEMPT.
   - Therefore, based on the rule ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR,"" this qualifies as BEHAVIOR. The hesitation (""idk if I should do it"") does not change the classification, as BEHAVIOR includes planning and preparation even with uncertainty.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out? I want to be done, I want to be out of this and I wish I could just sleep for now but I can't. I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore. Sorry for the total drivel, I'm so angry/down right now and I needed to vent.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit expressions of death wishes:  
   - ""make me want to die""  
   - ""I don't want to be here""  
   - ""makes me want to not exist""  
   - ""I want to disappear""  
   - ""I do not want to exist anymore""  
   Phrases like ""I want to be done"" and ""it would just be over"" also imply desire for cessation of existence.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Distress is current (""right now,"" ""3am,"" ""currently locked""), but no immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") for acting on suicidal thoughts. Urges are described (""fight the urge to go wandering""), but not as imminent plans.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (pills, weapons), locations, or preparations mentioned. ""Wandering off into the night"" is vague and lacks concrete suicide planning or research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present (death wishes).  
   - No plan/method/preparation described.  
   - No past attempt mentioned.  
   → Classification: **IDEATION** (explicit desire to die/not exist without specific plans).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Want to die,"" ""not exist,"" and ""disappear"" are explicit enough for IDEATION.  
- ""Wandering off"" is ambiguous and insufficient for BEHAVIOR classification.  
- No past attempts override current ideation.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including:  
   - ""the only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide"" (direct reference to suicide).  
   - ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive"" (explicit expression of not wanting to be alive).  
   - ""everyday I'm battling to stay alive"" (implies a struggle with suicidal thoughts).  
   Even though the person mentions not acting on these thoughts (e.g., not telling their therapist), the explicit references to suicide and death wishes are present, so this meets the criteria for suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language indicates ongoing, general thoughts rather than immediate plans:  
   - ""these days,"" ""severely depressed lately,"" ""always struggled,"" ""on a daily basis,"" and ""Most days"" suggest recurring ideation without urgency.  
   - No words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to"" imply immediacy.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts or actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned.  
   - The person discusses ideation but does not describe any concrete plans, means, or steps toward acting on suicidal thoughts.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.  
   - References to past behavior (e.g., ""Looking back at my past behavior"") relate to interpersonal issues and shame, not suicidal actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""ideations of suicide,"" ""wish I wasn't alive""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past suicide attempts are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION, as it expresses suicidal thoughts without specifics of plans or methods.  
   - Critical rules applied: Explicit mentions like ""ideations of suicide"" trigger IDEATION, even if the person expresses ambivalence (e.g., not telling therapist). No escalation to higher categories is warranted due to lack of plan or past action.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""thinking about killing myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. Phrases like ""killing myself"" clearly express a desire to die or end life, meeting the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""thinking about"" suggests ongoing or general thoughts rather than immediate action. There are no urgency indicators like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or specific timing references. The context (""starting to believe,"" ""It's been over 3 months"") indicates chronic distress, not imminent risk.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., writing notes), or research. The focus is on the thought of suicide, not on how it would be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post does not describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. It only discusses emotional pain and loneliness, with no reference to concrete actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""killing myself"") are present, so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of a past completed attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, this falls under IDEATION, as it expresses a desire to die without specific plans or actions.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions wanting to end suffering through a specific action: ""I want the constant anxiety and sadness of my pointless situation to stop by crashing into another car."" Phrases like ""crashing into another car"" and ""I won't die on impact"" directly reference death and self-inflicted harm, indicating a wish to die. The statement ""frequently come close to doing it"" reinforces recurrent suicidal thoughts.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" suggests ongoing and current urges, but there are no specific indicators of immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The focus is on recurring near-actions rather than past events.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is described: crashing a car into another car. This includes details like the scenario (driving at highway speed at night) and the intent to cause fatal harm. The phrase ""come close to doing it"" implies behavioral engagement or near-initiation of the plan, though not completion.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes interrupted actions: ""frequently come close to doing it but never can."" This indicates that the person has been on the verge of acting but stopped due to fear (e.g., of surviving in pain). There is no mention of a completed past suicide attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (wanting death via car crash).  
   - A specific method (car crash) is mentioned, and ""come close to doing it"" suggests preparation or near-action.  
   - This fits the BEHAVIOR category (suicidal thoughts with plan/method and interrupted actions).  
   - It is not ATTEMPT because no completed action occurred; it is not IDEATION due to the method specificity; and it is not INDICATOR because suicide/death is explicitly referenced.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The car crash metaphor explicitly expresses a death wish in context, satisfying the ""explicit vs. implicit"" rule.  
- ""Come close to doing it"" qualifies as an interrupted action, aligning with BEHAVIOR per the rules.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, BEHAVIOR is chosen due to method mention.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I'm going to kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. Phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""Only a matter of when"" indicate a desire to end one's life. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""I'm going to kill myself"" suggests future intent, and ""Only a matter of when"" implies it is impending but not immediate (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). There are no past suicide events described, only general distress about loneliness and abuse.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The post only expresses the intent without details on how or where.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes life stressors (e.g., friend abandonment, abuse from job and parents) but no past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm going to kill myself""), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicide thoughts but no plan/method, it is classified as IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- The phrase ""I'm going to kill myself"" is explicit, requiring classification above INDICATOR.  
- No method or plan is mentioned, so it cannot be BEHAVIOR.  
- Focus is on the author's current/future state, not past actions.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR only if a method is mentioned; here, none exists, so IDEATION is correct.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""Death is an option"" and discusses death as a preferable outcome in certain scenarios (""if somehow I got an accident and die... It's not the worst outcome""). This includes expressions related to wanting to die or finding death acceptable, even if passively (e.g., through an accident). The phrase ""Death is an option"" directly references suicide/death as a concept, and the person acknowledges it as a thought. Although they state ""I won't commit,"" the framework specifies that even explicit mentions of death or suicide, including passive wishes, count toward suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no indicators of current/immediate action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The post discusses a general, ongoing thought process (""Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought?"") and a hypothetical scenario (""if somehow I got an accident""), with no reference to past attempts or specific timing.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The person explicitly rules out action with ""I won't commit,"" and the reference to an accident is external and not self-initiated.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The content is solely about thoughts and hypotheticals.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (e.g., ""Death is an option"" and passive acceptance of death), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - There is no description of a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION, as it involves explicit expressions of death/suicide without a plan or method.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""Death is an option"" is an explicit mention, and passive ideation (e.g., wishing for accidental death) still qualifies for IDEATION.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""kill me"" and references to acting on these thoughts (e.g., ""tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me""). This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post indicates high urgency with words like ""tonight,"" ""last chance,"" and ""finally,"" pointing to immediate intent. There is also a reference to past planning (""been a year since I planned this""), but the focus is on current action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific preparations are described, such as ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything."" This shows concrete steps taken to act on suicidal thoughts, even though the exact method isn't named. This aligns with the BEHAVIOR category for preparations.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No past suicide attempts are mentioned; the post discusses future intent (""im doing the right after all"") and preparations, but no completed actions from the past.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill me""), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - There is a specific plan/preparation (""stuff prepared""), so it exceeds IDEATION.  
   - No past completed action is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   Therefore, with explicit thoughts AND preparations, it classifies as BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit content confirmed; ""kill me"" is direct.  
- No intrusive thoughts ambiguity; intent is clear.  
- Preparations (""stuff prepared"") qualify as BEHAVIOR, not an interrupted action.  
- Focus is on present/future, not past actions.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mention of ""kill myself"" appears, satisfying the requirement for suicide-related content.  
   - Additional phrases like ""this just ends"" and ""no reason to fuel it with energy"" imply a desire for life cessation.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Present-tense action: ""I've decided to stop eating"" and ""stave myself"" indicate current implementation.  
   - Goal-oriented: ""hope my body breaks down slowly"" shows active pursuit of death.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: ""stop eating all together and stave myself"" constitutes a concrete plan (self-starvation).  
   - Preparation: The decision is actively implemented (""decided to stop""), not merely contemplated.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No past attempts described; focus is on current behavior initiation.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thought (""kill myself"") + specific method (starvation) + active preparation → **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - Self-deprecation (""too much of a pussy"") doesn't negate the plan. Starvation is a deliberate method, not passive neglect.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains the phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone,"" which explicitly expresses a death wish. ""Wish to be gone"" is directly equivalent to ""want to be gone"" or ""want to die,"" as specified in the framework. This qualifies as an explicit mention of suicide/death wishes, even though it is conditional (""don't always"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The death wish is framed in a general/ongoing context (""don't always,"" ""for the most part,"" ""a great deal of the time""). There are no immediate indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"" tied to suicide actions. The phrase ""in this moment"" refers to loneliness, not suicide intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research about suicide are mentioned. The post focuses on emotional distress, confusion, and past hardships, but not actionable plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   References to past events (""I have dragged my face through the muds of life,"" ""seeing and experiencing some of the worst things"") are metaphorical and describe general suffering, not concrete suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. No language like ""I tried"" or ""I did"" related to suicide is present.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is identified (""wish to be gone""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicide thoughts but no plan or method, it classifies as IDEATION.  
   - Applying doubt rules: Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen due to explicit mention; between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, no escalation as no plan exists.

294,"Wish I could restart on life. I feel like I've permanently fucked up this life. I haven't done anything bad, just destroyed myself. I'm depressed constantly, suicidal, and lonely. I can barely even have the strength to go to school. Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to? The only person I have is my sibling, but I only feel worse knowing I'm hurting to delay the pain my death will cause. When I look at myself, I just feel pathetic and wish I wasn't so broken. I want a restart :/",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **Suicide Content Identification:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" in the phrase ""I'm depressed constantly, suicidal, and lonely."" This is a direct reference to suicide or death wishes. Additionally, phrases like ""delay the pain my death will cause"" explicitly mention death in a personal context, reinforcing the presence of suicide-related content. Even though the author expresses ambivalence (e.g., not wanting to hurt their sibling), the explicit use of ""suicidal"" qualifies under the framework.

2. **Urgency and Timing Indicators:** No immediate or time-bound indicators are present (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The phrase ""depressed constantly"" suggests ongoing, general feelings rather than imminent action. There are no references to past events or attempts.

3. **Plan/Method Assessment:** No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on emotional distress and hopelessness without concrete plans or actionable steps.

4. **Action History:** No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is limited to current thoughts and feelings.

5. **Decision Logic:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal""), but no plan, method, or preparation is indicated. 
   - According to the rules, this fits IDEATION: ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" 
   - There is no evidence to classify as BEHAVIOR (no plan/method) or ATTEMPT (no past actions). The mention of ""death"" in a future context (""delay the pain my death will cause"") is part of the ideation, not a plan.
   - The critical rules emphasize choosing IDEATION if any explicit suicide mention exists, even with ambivalence or intrusive thoughts.

295,"Work is killing me but I can't quit. Suicide becoming more enticing. Tl;Dr: Working retail has destroyed my body but can't stop working or family will lift a fuss. Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it. Nothing is happening and I don't believe my environment facilitates forward moment. Therefore it is probably best I head out before it gets worse. If nothing changes, the fuck am I getting up in the morning for?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases include: ""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life,"" ""best to end myself,"" and ""head out before it gets worse"" (implied suicide context). These are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). Phrases like ""I don't know if or when"" and ""If nothing changes"" suggest uncertainty about timing, leaning toward general/ongoing thoughts rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research mentioned. The post discusses suicidal thoughts broadly but lacks concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. Focus is on current ideation.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""take my own life,"" ""end myself"").  
   - **NO plan/method/preparation** is described.  
   - **NO past attempt** is mentioned.  
   - Classification aligns with **IDEATION** (explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans/methods).

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit suicide references confirm IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
- Ambivalence (""I don't know if or when"") doesn’t negate explicit ideation.  
- No methods/preparations to escalate to BEHAVIOR.  
- No past actions for ATTEMPT classification.

If my lines are even remotely accurate then i wont have much time to live. Goodbye",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit mentions include: ""slit my wrists,"" ""my death,"" ""want to get it over with,"" ""I won't have much time to live,"" and ""Goodbye."" Direct suicide intent is clear.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Phrases like ""I just slit,"" ""will post it once I have done it,"" and ""it's already too late"" indicate immediate action. The act is framed as completed upon posting.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods are detailed: researching radial artery location, marking the spot, and using a dremel with a saw attachment to cut wrists. Preparation (research, marking) is explicit.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The phrase ""I just slit my wrists"" describes a **completed action** taken at the time of writing. This is not an interrupted attempt or future plan—it is a past/current action with expected lethal consequences (""I won't have much time to live"").

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - Specific method/preparation described → Rules out IDEATION.  
   - **""I just slit my wrists"" confirms a completed action with intent to die** → Matches ATTEMPT (past/completed action, regardless of outcome).  
   - Critical Rule 4: Focus on the completed action (""slit my wrists"") over current desires.  
   - Critical Rule 5: Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT, choose ATTEMPT for concrete past actions.

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself. Is it better to be honest or is keeping quiet, potentially for his own health, better?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself."" These are direct expressions of suicidal ideation.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate time references (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The phrasing (""I'm suicidal,"" ""starting to find it hard"") suggests ongoing distress without current urgency.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific methods, locations, preparations, or research. The focus is on internal conflict and secrecy, not actionable plans.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The user explicitly states they've ""never told anyone"" and haven't acted.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are present (""I'm suicidal"").  
   - No plan/method/preparation is mentioned.  
   - No past attempt is described.  
   - Classification follows: Explicit suicide thoughts + no plan → **IDEATION**.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""I'm suicidal"" is an explicit expression of death wishes (Rule 1).  
- Focus is solely on the author's risk, not their friend's (Rule 1).  
- No ambiguity between categories: Explicit ideation without plan/method confirms IDEATION (Rule 5).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which directly refers to suicide and wanting to die. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.
2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language is conditional (""if I become worse"") and not immediate; there are no indicators of current timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). It expresses a potential future scenario.
3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods, plans, preparations, or locations are mentioned. The phrase ""kill myself"" is general, with no details on how, where, or when.
4. **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on hypothetical future actions.
5. **DECISION LOGIC:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""kill myself"") are present.
   - No plan, method, or preparation is indicated.
   - No past attempt is described.
   - According to the rules, this falls under IDEATION because it involves explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.

Critical Rules Check:
- Explicit mention (""kill myself"") confirms IDEATION over INDICATOR.
- No method or plan, so not BEHAVIOR.
- No past action, so not ATTEMPT.
- When in doubt, choose IDEATION due to explicit suicide mention.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Explicit phrases found: ""I wanted to die when I made that post"" (direct expression of past death wish).  
   - Additional context: ""I just don't want to die"" shows ambivalence but doesn’t negate the explicit death wish expressed earlier.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - Past timing: ""wanted to die **when I made that post**"" (refers to a specific past moment, not immediate).  
   - No current urgency indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No mention of methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research.  
   - Focus is on emotional distress and failed communication attempts.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - No description of past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" is absent).  
   - Deleted draft is an accident, not a suicide-related action.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""wanted to die"") → Rules out *INDICATOR*.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Confirms *IDEATION* (past ideation still qualifies).  
   - ""I don't want to die"" reflects current ambivalence but doesn’t erase the explicit prior death wish.  
   - No evidence of *BEHAVIOR* (plan/action) or *ATTEMPT* (completed past action).  

**Critical Rules Applied**:  
- Explicit mention of death wish (""wanted to die"") triggers *IDEATION* even if passive/past.  
- No method/plan → Not *BEHAVIOR*.  
- No described suicide action → Not *ATTEMPT*.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point."" This directly references suicide and wanting to die. Phrases like ""I'm ready to say goodbye"" also imply a death wish in context, reinforcing explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Words like ""at this point"" and ""I'm ready"" indicate current/ongoing suicidal thoughts, but no specific immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"") or past actions are described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The statement is general about intent without details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. ""Trying to kill myself"" is present-tense and not a report of a completed action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""trying to kill myself"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is indicated.  
   - This fits the IDEATION category, as per the rule: explicit suicide thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Ambivalence (""I'm ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not"") does not change the classification, as explicit suicide mention still qualifies as IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide (e.g., ""trying to kill myself"") overrides general distress, so not INDICATOR.  
- No method/plan, so not BEHAVIOR.  
- No past action, so not ATTEMPT.  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen due to explicit suicide content.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including:  
   - ""killing myself"" (direct reference to suicide)  
   - ""I could do it right now"" (where ""it"" implies suicide)  
   - ""hope that I don't wake up"" (expresses a wish to not be alive)  
   These phrases clearly indicate explicit suicidal thoughts.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""I could do it right now"" uses ""right now,"" indicating current/immediate timing and urgency.  
   - ""It's a neverending cycle"" and ""I'm done"" suggest ongoing distress but reinforce the present focus.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The reference to parents taking ""any means they can think of"" implies removed access but does not detail any current plan or method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried"" or actions taken). The post states ""I haven't"" acted, focusing on current barriers (fear) rather than past actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""killing myself""), but no specific plan, method, or preparation is described. Therefore, based on the framework:  
     - Explicit suicide thoughts + NO plan/method → IDEATION  
   - Critical rules applied:

The only thing keeping me here is I don't know what happens after I die. I don't know if there's a heaven (I doubt) or is it just complete blackness.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly states: ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself"". This directly mentions suicide, death wishes, and a desire to end life. Even though the person expresses fear of death, the explicit references to suicide and wanting to die are present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language is present-tense and ongoing (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"", ""the only thing keeping me alive""), but there are no immediate time indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"". The tone suggests persistent thoughts rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The person discusses abstract fears (e.g., uncertainty about the afterlife) but no concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content focuses on current thoughts and emotions, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""I want to kill myself"") are present, but no plan, method, or preparation is indicated. This aligns with the IDEATION category.  
   - The absence of a plan or past attempt rules out BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT. The explicit suicide content rules out INDICATOR.  
   - Per critical rules:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains the explicit phrase ""I'm better off dead,"" which directly expresses a death wish. This qualifies as an explicit mention of wanting to be dead, even without the word ""suicide."" Other phrases like ""My being in itself is a prison"" and ""Can't stand this anymore"" indicate distress but do not explicitly reference suicide or death on their own.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The phrase ""Can't stand this anymore"" suggests ongoing distress, and ""for the past few months"" indicates a general/ongoing timeframe. No urgency indicators for imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The content focuses on emotional suffering without actionable plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. References to ""cause anguish and pain to those around me"" relate to emotional impact, not suicidal actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wish is present (""I'm better off dead"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.  
   - No past attempt is described.  
   - Therefore, based on the framework, this falls under IDEATION because there is an explicit expression of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- ""I'm better off dead"" is explicit in the context of distress, so IDEATION over INDICATOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and describes suicidal intent (""came extraordinarily close to killing myself""). This qualifies as explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Describes past urgency (""days away from going through with"") but frames it retrospectively (""I came extraordinarily close""). No current/immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific preparations are mentioned: ""letters were written"" and ""had a set plan."" This confirms concrete behavioral steps.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of a *completed* suicide attempt (e.g., ""I took pills""). Actions are preparatory (writing letters, planning) but stopped short of execution.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts? **Yes** (""killing myself"").  
   - Plan/method/preparation? **Yes** (letters, set plan).  
   - Completed past attempt? **No** (only preparation, not action).  
   → Matches **BEHAVIOR** (plan + preparation without completed attempt).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Close to killing myself"" is explicit suicide content.  
- Preparations (letters, plan) qualify as BEHAVIOR.  
- ""Days away from going through with"" indicates interrupted/intended action, not a completed ATTEMPT.  
- Past context doesn’t change classification of the described preparatory actions.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""wished I wasn't alive"" and ""wanted things to be over,"" which directly express a desire not to be alive. The phrase ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it"" contextually refer to suicide (e.g., ""it"" implies ending life), making this an explicit expression of death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language describes ongoing feelings since 2012 (""fairly regularly"") and past reflections (""whenever I think back,"" ""years ago""), with no current/immediate terms like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The focus is on regret about not acting in the past, not imminent plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or research are mentioned. The content revolves around thoughts and regrets, not concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. Phrases like ""not doing it"" and ""wish that I had just done it"" emphasize inaction or hypothetical scenarios, not completed or initiated actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (e.g., ""wished I wasn't alive"") are present, but no plan, method, or preparation is indicated. This fits the IDEATION category. No past attempt is described, ruling out ATTEMPT. The absence of a plan also rules out BEHAVIOR. While distress and regret are evident, the explicit death wishes prevent classification as INDICATOR.

**Critical Rules Consideration:**  
- ""Wished I wasn't alive"" is an explicit death wish, so IDEATION takes precedence over INDICATOR.  
- No method or plan mentioned, so not BEHAVIOR.  
- Focus is on the person's own thoughts and regrets, not others.  
- When in doubt, explicit mention of death/suicide leans toward IDEATION.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""I'm depressed and suicidal,"" ""wanting to die,"" and ""killing myself."" Phrases like ""get ready to die"" also indicate a desire for death. This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language suggests ongoing or recurring thoughts rather than immediate action. Terms like ""everytime I think about killing myself,"" ""there are times where I just get ready to die,"" and ""the administrative thought pops up"" indicate a general/ongoing pattern without specific urgency (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). The note-writing is described as a past event (""I have written a note""), but this is part of preparation, not a timing indicator for imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific preparations are described, including writing a suicide note with details about possessions (""written a note that also includes what I want each person to recieve that was mine"") and considering administrative tasks to avoid burdening family (""things I should cancel before""). However, no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location is mentioned. Writing a note is explicitly listed as a preparation under the BEHAVIOR category.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes writing a suicide note as a completed preparatory action (""I have past the point where I have written a note""). It also mentions ""get ready to die,"" which could imply behavioral steps, but this is interrupted by administrative thoughts and not specified as a physical action (e.g., no description of an attempt like overdosing). This aligns with interrupted or preparatory behavior, not a completed suicide attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present, so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Preparations (writing a note) are mentioned, so it cannot be IDEATION (which requires no plan/method/preparation).  
   - No completed suicide attempt is described (e.g., no action like taking pills or jumping), so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - With explicit thoughts AND preparations (note-writing), it fits BEHAVIOR. The ""get ready to die"" phrase, while vague, supports behavioral intent but is not sufficient for ATTEMPT classification as it lacks concrete action.  
   - Applying the ""when in doubt"" rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because of the preparation (note-writing). Between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT, choose BEHAVIOR as no past attempt occurred.

**Final Classification Reasoning:**  
The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts combined with specific preparations (writing a detailed suicide note), falling under BEHAVIOR. The interrupted nature of ""getting ready to die"" due to administrative thoughts aligns with behavioral but not attempt-level risk. No past suicide attempt is described, only preparatory actions.

One of my friebds thought i was stalking the friendd. I got in trouble woth my family and ive never been more suicidal in my life.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""ive never been more suicidal in my life."" The term ""suicidal"" directly refers to thoughts of suicide or wanting to die, satisfying the requirement for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""in my life"" suggests a current or ongoing state of heightened suicidal feelings, but it lacks immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It indicates general distress rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations, or locations are mentioned. The post describes a past incident of trespassing and family trouble, but these are unrelated to suicide methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm related to suicide. The actions mentioned (trespassing, getting in trouble) are contextual life events, not suicide behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal""), but no plans, methods, or preparations are indicated. Based on the framework, this falls under IDEATION. The absence of a plan rules out BEHAVIOR, and no past suicide attempt is described, ruling out ATTEMPT. The explicit mention of suicide also rules out INDICATOR.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- The word ""suicidal"" is an explicit expression of death wishes, so IDEATION is appropriate.  
- No doubt between categories: Explicit suicide content without plan/method = IDEATION.

This country is a prison colony and it appears to be testing grounds to removing the flaws and imperfections in the human race and turning men into women.It's what hitler devised that he wanted to remove the flaws and imperfections and  wanted to purify the human race.

We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post discusses societal oppression, fascism, and historical atrocities (Auschwitz/Hitler) but contains **no explicit mention** of personal suicide, death wishes, ending one's life, or wanting to die.  
   - Phrases like ""We are all slaves"" or ""removing flaws"" refer to systemic issues, not personal desire for death.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No references to immediate/past/future personal actions (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""tried,"" ""planning""). Describes ongoing societal conditions (""We are slaves"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - **No mention** of suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. Focus is on political critique.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - **No description** of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - **NO explicit suicide/death wishes** → Falls under **INDICATOR**.  
   - The post expresses distress (""slaves to a fascist regime""), hopelessness (""no freedom""), and dissatisfaction with life/society but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal intent**.  

**Critical Rules Verification:**  
- All mentions of death (e.g., Auschwitz/Hitler) are historical/societal, **not personal**.  
- ""Wanting us to be controlled"" refers to oppression, **not self-harm**.  
- Follows ""when in doubt"" rule: No suicide mention → INDICATOR.

I'm nobodies first choice or even second choice, nobody seems to think about me at all. I feel so alone in the world, and I'm soon going to go to college, where I will no absolutely nobody. Its seems so terrifying. I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus. Thats what I want more than anything else.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus."" This is a direct expression of wanting to die, which qualifies as an explicit suicide/death wish. Phrases like ""Heaven seems really good right now"" and ""I just want to die"" reinforce this, as they indicate a desire to be dead or escape life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""I just want to die"" uses ""want to,"" indicating a current desire, but there are no immediate timing words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""today."" The context focuses on ongoing distress (e.g., feeling alone, fear of college) rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or research are mentioned. The expression is a general wish to die without details on how it would be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post describes emotional pain and desires but no concrete actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I just want to die"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is indicated.  
   - No past attempt is described.  
   - Therefore, based on the rules, this is classified as IDEATION (explicit thoughts without specific plans/methods).  

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I just want to die"" is explicit, so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
- Intrusive Thoughts: Even as a wish (""go to Heaven""), the explicit death mention still counts.  
- When in Doubt: Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit mention; no escalation to BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT due to lack of plan or past action.  
- Focus: Only the author's risk is considered, with no references to others.

I have this hoplessness feeling like i'm stuck inside of a nightmare but i don't wake up and ugh. i'm sorry but right now i'm considering suicide because i can't fucking take it anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""considering suicide"" in the phrase: ""right now i'm considering suicide because i can't fucking take it anymore."" This is a direct reference to suicidal thoughts, even though it uses the word ""considering."" Phrases like ""life is worse than death"" and ""hopelessness feeling"" indicate distress but are not explicit suicide mentions on their own; however, the explicit ""considering suicide"" qualifies as a suicide/death wish.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post uses ""right now"" multiple times (e.g., ""right now i have so many bad memories,"" ""right now i'm considering suicide""), indicating current/immediate suicidal thoughts, not past or general ones.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or research about suicide. The post only expresses the consideration of suicide without detailing how, when, or where it might happen.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to""), interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors is present. The content focuses solely on current feelings and thoughts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""considering suicide""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past suicide attempt is described, so it does not qualify as ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION, as it expresses a desire to die or commit suicide without specific plans or methods.  
   - Applying the ""when in doubt"" rule: The explicit suicide mention overrules INDICATOR, and the lack of method/plan keeps it at IDEATION rather than BEHAVIOR.

I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   The author explicitly states: ""I'm suicidal myself"". This directly expresses suicidal thoughts without ambiguity.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"") are used regarding the author's own suicidal thoughts. The context is ongoing (""I'm suicidal"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   No mention of specific methods, locations, preparations, or research related to the author's own suicidal thoughts.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   No description of past suicide attempts by the author. References to attempts (""multiple suicide attempts"") solely concern the friend.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""I'm suicidal myself"") → Triggers IDEATION or higher.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of past personal suicide attempts → Does not meet ATTEMPT criteria.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth.

Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life"" and references ""the emotional pain that I will cause [...] is not worth my current existence on earth."" These are clear expressions of wanting to die/end life. Additional phrases like ""killing myself"" and debating whether ""more pain would be created by suicide"" reinforce explicit suicide/death wishes.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate urgency indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The user describes a persistent thought process (""recently,"" ""usually I find myself"") but no specific timeline for action.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research. The focus is on philosophical justification (""utilitarian,"" ""logic"") and emotional conflict, not actionable plans.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   References self-directed anger causing damage only to ""my own"" (implying self-harm) but explicitly states no past suicide attempts (""I have never caused damage to any human body [...] other than my own""). No descriptions of interrupted suicide actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide wishes are present (""end my own life,"" ""killing myself"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations → Rules out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of past suicide actions (only self-harm) → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - Classification aligns with IDEATION due to explicit death wishes without plans/methods.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit phrases like ""end my own life"" trigger IDEATION regardless of philosophical context.  
- Self-harm references don’t escalate to ATTEMPT without suicidal intent.  
- ""Cry for help"" mentions don’t override explicit suicide ideation.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post includes explicit expressions related to suicide and death wishes: ""end it all"" and ""don't want to be here"" clearly indicate a desire to die or cease existing. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content, as ""end it all"" is a direct euphemism for suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - There are no immediate or urgent time indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). Phrases like ""my thoughts always just come back to this"" and ""everyday is pressure"" suggest ongoing, general distress rather than a specific timeline for action. No past attempts or events are mentioned.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post specifically mentions a method: ""gun"" as a solution (""which would solve everything""). It also includes seeking or commenting on methods with the rhetorical question, ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all,"" which implies research or frustration about available suicide methods. This qualifies as mentioning a specific method and seeking information, falling under BEHAVIOR criteria.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content focuses on current thoughts and hypotheticals.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from step 1), and a specific method (gun) is mentioned (from step 3), even though it is noted as inaccessible. According to the rules, any mention of a method or plan moves the classification to BEHAVIOR. The critical rule states: ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" Here, the gun reference and the question about methods constitute sufficient evidence for BEHAVIOR, as it goes beyond general ideation.

I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""wanting to kill myself"" and ""the thought of killing myself."" This constitutes a clear expression of suicidal thoughts, as it directly references suicide and death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrasing ""I just kept thinking about"" suggests ongoing or recurring thoughts, with no immediate or time-specific indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It reflects a general state rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research. The reference to killing oneself remains vague and conceptual, without details on how it would be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes masturbating to the thought of suicide, but this is not a suicide attempt or self-harm behavior with intent to die. No past suicide attempts (e.g., overdosing, jumping) are mentioned; the focus is on thoughts and emotional distress.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""wanting to kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is described, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed. Thanks for making it this far if you read the whole thing.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""end my life"" (stated multiple times, e.g., ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"" and ""talking about wanting to end my life""). The phrase ""suicide is seen as a solution"" and ""means of escape"" also directly reference suicide in a personal context. This satisfies the criterion for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - There are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"" for suicidal actions. The statement ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"" implies future intent but is vague and not time-specific. The ending (""I'm going to bed"") indicates current non-suicidal activity. Urgency is low; the focus is on general feelings and stigma, not imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means), or research are mentioned. The discussion remains abstract, centering on personal views and societal stigma without concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. References to ""I tried"" or similar are absent; the content is about current thoughts and future intent, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (e.g., ""end my life"") are present, but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. Therefore, based on the logic: explicit thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit phrases like ""end my life"" are clear death wishes, even in a philosophical context.  
- No plan/method mentioned, so not BEHAVIOR.  
- No past actions described, so not ATTEMPT.  
- Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, explicit mention of suicide/death warrants IDEATION.

### Step-by-Step Analysis Using the Framework

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post discusses self-harm (cutting) and emotional distress, but there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die by the person writing the post. Phrases like ""wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" express hopelessness but do not explicitly reference suicide, killing oneself, ending life, or wanting to be dead. The only explicit suicide reference is about others encouraging the girlfriend (""K"") to kill herself, but this does not pertain to the writer.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The self-harm incident described (""a few months ago"") is in the past, with no current or immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""going to""). The phrase ""some day's i wonder"" indicates ongoing general distress, not urgency related to suicide.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of any suicide plan, method, preparation, or research by the writer. The focus is on self-harm (cutting) as a coping mechanism for emotional pain, not as a method for suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - The writer describes past self-harm behaviors (cutting to ""relieve some of the pain""), which resulted in scars. However, this is framed as non-suicidal self-injury for emotional relief, not a suicide attempt. There is no indication of intent to die, and it is not classified as a past suicide attempt under the framework.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - There is NO explicit mention of suicide or death wishes by the writer → This points to INDICATOR.
   - Self-harm is present but does not elevate the category to IDEATION, BEHAVIOR, or ATTEMPT because:
     - No explicit suicidal thoughts are expressed.
     - Self-harm alone is not equivalent to suicide behavior or attempt unless tied to suicidal intent (which is absent here).
   - The distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction (e.g., feeling misunderstood, crying, questioning life's worth) align with INDICATOR.

**Critical Rules Applied:**
- The classification focuses solely on the writer, not others (e.g., the encouragement for K to kill herself is irrelevant).
- ""Wondering if it's even worth it"" is implicit distress, not an explicit suicide mention, so it does not meet the threshold for IDEATION.
- Self-harm is noted in ACTION HISTORY but is not suicidal; thus, it doesn't trigger BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.
- When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, IDEATION is only chosen for explicit suicide mentions (absent here).

**Conclusion:** The post expresses severe distress, invalidation, and hopelessness without any explicit suicide content, fitting the INDICATOR category.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" multiple times (e.g., ""Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation,"" ""act on my suicidal thoughts""). These are direct references to wanting to die or end life, which meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The thoughts are described as current (""at this point"") and ongoing, with the user expressing concern that their risk ""can change."" However, there are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The focus is on future help-seeking (waiting until February 1st for insurance), so urgency is not acute.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or research are mentioned. Instead, the user discusses avoiding action by considering hospitalization, which indicates a lack of active planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The user references bipolar symptoms and coping struggles but no concrete suicidal actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (suicidal ideation), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is indicated, ruling out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempt is described, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the classification is IDEATION based on explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without specific plans or methods.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit phrases like ""suicidal ideation"" trigger IDEATION per the rules, even if the user states they don't want to act.  
- No doubt between categories: Explicit thoughts without plans clearly fit IDEATION.  
- Risk is solely for the user, with no irrelevant details.

Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution for drug addicts and mentally ill people and be forced anti psychotics there. Fuck that I once took a anti psychotic and it just kills me inside and some 'other person' takes over. My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die, such as ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead."" These phrases directly indicate a wish for death, falling under the criteria for explicit suicide/death mentions.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""soon"" is used multiple times, indicating a sense of immediacy (e.g., ""Soon I will be finally dead""). The reference to ""within 4 weeks"" provides a timeframe, but the focus on ""soon"" suggests current urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. While the post describes daily heroin use, this is presented as ongoing behavior rather than an explicit suicide plan (e.g., no indication that heroin is being used with the intent to die by overdose). There is also no mention of research, specific locations, or preparations tied to suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts or interrupted actions. The reference to taking an antipsychotic in the past relates to medication effects, not a suicide attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""I hope I die soon""), but there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.  
   - According to the classification rules, this falls under IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.  
   - Heroin use, while self-destructive, is not explicitly tied to a suicide plan and is more indicative of general risk or distress, not BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempt is described, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
   - Given explicit death wishes, IDEATION is chosen over INDICATOR.

321,"What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem. I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly references suicide methods by asking about the ""best position of the gun for hitting the brain stem,"" which directly relates to causing death. Phrases like this indicate a desire to die, and the dismissal of reasons to live (e.g., ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you"") reinforces suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no immediate time indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The focus is on method research, suggesting ongoing or general contemplation rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method (gunshot to the brain stem) is mentioned, and the user is seeking information on optimizing it (""What position is best""). This constitutes research into suicide methods, which aligns with BEHAVIOR.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm is present. The post discusses current thoughts and planning, not completed actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (method-focused language).  
   - A specific method and research are mentioned, so this falls under BEHAVIOR (explicit thoughts + plan/method/research).  
   - No past attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- The gun position question is explicit suicide content with a method.  
- Seeking method information qualifies as BEHAVIOR per the framework.  
- No doubt between categories: Method/research moves this beyond IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.

322,"there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head. everything just keeps getting worse, my mum saw my self harm scars and got angry at me and told me i have nothing to be upset over and i'm dramatic and stuff lol",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **Suicide Content Identification:** The post explicitly mentions ""thought about killing myself,"" which directly references suicide and wanting to die. This satisfies the criterion for explicit suicide content, regardless of whether the person expresses intent to act on these thoughts.

2. **Urgency and Timing Indicators:** The phrase ""there hasn't been a single day"" indicates persistent, ongoing suicidal thoughts, but there are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to."" The mention of self-harm scars refers to past actions, but not a specific suicide attempt.

3. **Plan/Method Assessment:** No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The self-harm scars imply past self-injury, but this is not described as part of a suicide plan or method in the context of the post.

4. **Action History:** Self-harm scars are noted, but self-harm (e.g., cutting) is classified under general self-injury behaviors and does not constitute a suicide attempt unless specified as having suicidal intent. Here, there is no description of a past suicide attempt (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself""), so it does not meet the criteria for ATTEMPT.

5. **Decision Logic:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""thought about killing myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.
   - Therefore, with explicit suicidal thoughts but no plan or method, the classification is IDEATION, consistent with examples like ""I want to kill myself"" without method details.
   - The self-harm reference does not change the classification, as it is separate from the expressed suicidal ideation and not tied to a suicide plan in this context.

323,"I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. No amount of sleep helps, I still feel like trash. I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it. I'm sick of life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and expresses a desire to end life with phrases like ""my only way out is killing myself,"" ""I'm sick of life,"" and ""Let's just do it."" This confirms explicit suicide/death content, ruling out INDICATOR.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""Let's just do it"" suggest current/immediate intent, but there are no specific time references (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""today""). However, urgency alone doesn't change the classification without a plan.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The phrase ""killing myself"" is general and lacks detail about how, where, or when.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current thoughts and intentions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present, but no plan/method is specified.
   - According to the rules, this falls under IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.
   - The phrase ""Let's just do it"" implies intent but does not constitute a specific plan or preparation, so it does not elevate to BEHAVIOR. When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR only if a method is mentioned, which is not the case here.

324,"Just a few more hours. Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again. I'm just so tired. Not even sleep can fix this type of tired. My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better. I am not fighting anymore because I give up. I give up fighting for a body that I don't want to live in anymore. I am living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that wants to die. My body has lost the fight and my mind has won. Goodbye.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes:  
     - ""I'm going to attempt again"" (implies a future suicide attempt).  
     - ""I've tried to overdose three times"" (direct reference to past suicide actions).  
     - ""I want to die"" (explicit expression of death wish).  
     - ""My mind wants to die"" (another explicit statement about desiring death).  
     - ""Goodbye"" (contextually suggests a farewell, often associated with suicide).  
   - Conclusion: Explicit suicide content is present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current/immediate: ""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again"" indicates high urgency and a plan for imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"" implied).  
   - Past events: ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year"" describe specific past attempts.  
   - General/ongoing: Statements like ""I don't want to get better"" and ""I am not fighting anymore"" reflect persistent suicidal thoughts.  
   - Conclusion: Both immediate and past timing indicators are strong.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: ""Overdose"" is mentioned as the method used in past attempts and implied for the future (""I'm going to attempt again"" in context of overdose history).  
   - Preparations: No explicit details on current preparations (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes), but the imminent timeline (""just a few more hours"") suggests intent.  
   - Conclusion: A specific method (overdose) is associated with both past and future actions.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Past attempts: ""I've tried to overdose three times"" and ""my first attempt"" clearly describe completed suicide attempts with concrete actions (overdosing). This qualifies as past attempts under the ATTEMPT category.  
   - Interrupted actions: None described; all references are to completed attempts.  
   - Self-harm behaviors: Overdose is specified, but no other self-harm mentioned.  
   - Conclusion: Past completed suicide attempts are explicitly stated.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""want to die""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific method (overdose) is mentioned, so it cannot be IDEATION (which requires no method).  
   - Past completed attempts are described (""I've tried to overdose three times""), which directly fits the ATTEMPT category.  
   - Critical Rule: The ATTEMPT category definition states: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" Here, current plans (""I'm going to attempt again"") are mentioned alongside past attempts, so ATTEMPT takes precedence over BEHAVIOR.  
   - Doubt Resolution: Between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT, choose ATTEMPT because of the described past completed actions.

Final Classification: ATTEMPT, based on the explicit description of past suicide attempts, which is the defining factor per the rules.

And to top things off. these influences and genetics I became an alcoholic and I just want this pain to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post describes severe distress, including family issues, trauma, and alcoholism, with the phrase ""I just want this pain to end."" However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""be dead,"" or ""not want to be alive""). The expression ""want this pain to end"" implies a desire for relief from suffering but is not an explicit reference to suicide or death, based on the framework's requirement for explicit language.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The post uses language like ""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore,"" which indicates ongoing distress, but there are no immediate or specific timing indicators related to suicide (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""going to""). References to past events (e.g., the friend drowning, mother's condition) are contextual and not tied to the author's suicidal actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. The content focuses on life circumstances and emotional pain, not planning or methods for self-harm.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors by the author. The mention of ""I saved the person that killed him"" refers to an external event and not the author's own actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the classification falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses hopelessness and distress but lacks the explicit suicidal content required for IDEATION, BEHAVIOR, or ATTEMPT.

**Critical Rules Application:**
- Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I just want this pain to end"" is implicit distress, not explicit suicide/death language.
- When in Doubt: No explicit suicide mention, so INDICATOR is chosen over IDEATION.
- Focus: Only the author's risk is considered; other people's events (e.g., friend drowning) are irrelevant.
- Rules Adherence: Strictly following classification logic and outputting only one word.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I'm suicidal,"" which directly references suicide. Phrases like ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"" indicate a desire to die or not continue living, reinforcing explicit death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" suggests a timeframe (this summer) that is near-future, indicating current or impending risk. ""Maybe it is time"" implies immediacy in decision-making but lacks concrete timing like ""tonight"" or ""now.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The content focuses on emotional expression and admission of suicidal thoughts without detailing how it might be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post only discusses admitting feelings to the mother, not any actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal,"" ""don't think I'll make it,"" ""time to go""), but no plan, method, or preparation is indicated. Therefore, this falls under IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied: Explicit mentions override implicit ones (e.g., ""suicidal"" is clear). No method means not BEHAVIOR; no past action means not ATTEMPT. Doubt resolution: Explicit suicide content moves this out of INDICATOR.

I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I should have killed myself,"" ""I tried. I tried. But it didn’t work,"" ""I promise I won’t fail this time,"" ""gonna be gone after this weekend,"" and ""I have heard hanging is painless.""  
   - These are clear expressions of suicidal intent, death wishes, and past actions.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Immediate timing: ""gonna be gone after this weekend"" (specific near-future plan).  
   - Past events: ""I tried. I tried. But it didn’t work"" (confirmed past attempt).  
   - Ongoing distress: ""I’m drowning in depression,"" ""I can’t take it anymore.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: ""hanging is painless"" (explicitly mentioned).  
   - Preparations: ""I’m gonna buy the right stuff"" and ""Say my goodbyes.""  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Past attempt: ""I tried. I tried. But it didn’t work"" (describes a completed action with intent to die, despite failure).  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide intent (IDEATION) + specific method/preparation (BEHAVIOR) are present, BUT the post describes a **past completed suicide attempt** (""I tried"").  
   - Classification Rule: Posts describing past completed attempts (regardless of outcome or current plans) must be classified as **ATTEMPT**.  

**Critical Rule Application:**  
- The phrase ""I tried. I tried. But it didn’t work"" confirms a concrete past action with intent to die, meeting the ATTEMPT threshold. Current plans do not override this classification per the rules.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which directly refers to suicide. Phrases like ""Adios i can't. It's not worth it"" and ""this life for me isn't it"" reinforce a desire to end life. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timing is future-oriented (""at 30 or 25,"" ""in 8 yrs or so""), with no immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The person indicates a long timeframe for reconsideration (""I still have a long time to rethink my decisions""), so this is not current or imminent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or research. The word ""planning"" refers only to a general future intention without concrete details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content focuses solely on future thoughts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""killing myself"").  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so this does not qualify as BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Since explicit suicide thoughts exist without a plan or method, this fits IDEATION according to the classification rules.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Rule 1: ""killing myself"" is an explicit expression.  
     - Rule 5: With no method/plan, IDEATION is chosen over BEHAVIOR.  
     - The ambivalence (e.g., ""I can still seek out help"") does not override the explicit mention of suicide.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post mentions ""suicide rate for men"" in a statistical context, but there is no explicit personal expression of wanting to die, commit suicide, end life, or any equivalent phrases (e.g., ""I want to kill myself,"" ""I don't want to be alive""). The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" is metaphorical and refers to distress or instability, but it does not explicitly state a death wish or suicide intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - ""Lately"" indicates a general, ongoing state of distress, but there are no immediate or specific timing indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") related to suicide. No past personal suicide attempts or actions are described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The content focuses on societal issues and personal feelings of being perceived as a threat, not on personal suicide planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The reference to suicide rates is general and not personal.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die by the person themselves (only a general discussion of suicide statistics), the classification falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses distress and hopelessness related to identity and societal perceptions, but without explicit suicidal content.

**Critical Rules Applied:**
- Explicit vs. Implicit: ""Teetering on the edge"" is implicit distress, not an explicit suicide statement. Statistical mentions of suicide do not count as personal expressions.
- When in Doubt: With no explicit suicide mention, the choice between INDICATOR and IDEATION defaults to INDICATOR.
- Focus: The risk assessment is for the author, not others mentioned (e.g., cismen).

330,My mom told me suicide is a coward way to go out. Thanks mom. Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours. Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :(.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit references to death/suicide: ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours."" ""Gone"" is a direct euphemism for death or suicide in this context, especially given the preceding mention of suicide (""suicide is a coward way to go out"") and the farewell tone (""Peace out all""). This qualifies as an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""within 24 hours"" indicates immediacy and current intent, suggesting a high-risk timeframe.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparation, or research is mentioned. The statement is general and lacks concrete details about how the suicide might occur.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The focus is on potential future action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm gone within 24 hours""), but there is no plan/method described. According to the rules, this falls under IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""I'm gone within 24 hours"" is explicit in the context of distress.  
     - ""When in Doubt"": Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit death mention. No method means not BEHAVIOR. No past action means not ATTEMPT.

331,"Abused as a child. I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I don't have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains the phrase ""it's killing me."" While this expresses severe distress, it is an idiomatic expression rather than an explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or a desire to die. No other terms like ""suicide,"" ""end my life,"" or ""want to die"" appear.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate timing words (""tonight,"" ""now"") or references to past suicide attempts. Distress is described as ongoing due to the current living situation.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of suicide methods, plans, locations, preparations, or research. The focus is on seeking legal protection (restraining order) and escaping abuse.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted suicide actions. The only past actions mentioned relate to reporting abuse and subsequent manipulation.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   No explicit suicide/death wishes → **INDICATOR**.  
   The post describes intense emotional pain, hopelessness, and trauma (""I hate myself,"" ""it's killing me""), but all expressions of distress remain metaphorical and lack literal suicidal intent.

332,"Three Days Changes Everything. I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend. It started with an old trigger, then every little problem, every panic attack I had learned to power through, ended with my harming. I swore to my family I could stop, I swore to the love of my life I would stop, I told myself I would stop. Now after four months I'm self harming again. What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time."" This includes phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""do it,"" which directly reference suicide or ending one's life.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - There are current/immediate indicators: ""it's a matter of time"" and ""I should do it now"" suggest present intent and urgency.  
   - Past events are mentioned (e.g., self-harm over the weekend and four months ago), but these relate to self-harm, not suicide attempts.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location is described. The phrase ""kill myself"" is general and lacks details about how, when, or where.  
   - Self-harm (""bloodying myself up"") is mentioned, but it is presented as a separate behavior that may escalate to suicide, not as a specific plan or preparation for suicide.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post describes current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") and a history of self-harm (e.g., relapse after four months), but no past suicide attempts are mentioned. Self-harm is not equivalent to a suicide attempt unless specified; here, it is framed as distinct from the suicidal thoughts.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan, method, preparation, or interrupted attempt for suicide is described. The self-harm is ongoing but not tied to a suicide method or plan.  
   - Therefore, based on the rules:  
     - Explicit suicide thoughts without a plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR only if a method/plan is mentioned; none are here.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit phrases like ""kill myself"" trigger at least IDEATION.  
- Self-harm alone does not constitute BEHAVIOR unless it is part of a suicide plan; here, it is separate.  
- No past suicide attempts are described, so not ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die or be killed, including:  
   - ""someone blow my head off"" (direct request for death, implying suicide)  
   - ""i fucking deserve death"" (explicit mention of deserving death)  
   - ""please kill me"" (direct plea for death)  
   These phrases indicate clear suicidal intent or death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language suggests current distress: ""im fucking done"" and ""please kill me"" imply immediacy.  
   - ""I always"" indicates ongoing feelings, but the primary expressions (""blow my head off,"" ""kill me"") focus on the present.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""blow my head off"" refers to death by shooting, which is a concrete suicide method.  
   - No specific locations, preparations, or research are described, but the method itself is explicit.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The post focuses on current desires and thoughts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""blow my head off,"" ""deserve death,"" ""kill me"").  
   - A specific method (""blow my head off"") is included, which falls under BEHAVIOR according to the framework (mentioning specific methods like pills, jumping, or weapons).  
   - There is no description of a past completed attempt, so ATTEMPT does not apply.  
   - Critical Rule 5: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if any method/plan is mentioned. Here, the method is specified.  
   - Critical Rule 1: Phrases like ""blow my head off"" and ""kill me"" are explicit in the context of distress, reinforcing BEHAVIOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""if I ended my life right now"". This directly expresses a desire to end one's life, meeting the criteria for explicit suicide mention.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""right now"" indicates current/immediate timing for the suicidal thought.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, cutting), location, preparation, or research is mentioned. The phrase ""ended my life"" is general and lacks concrete details.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The statement is hypothetical (""if I ended"").  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thought is present (""ended my life"").  
   - No plan/method/preparation is described.  
   - Classification must default to **IDEATION** per rules:  
     *""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION""*.  
   - Critical Rule 2 applies: Abstract timing (""right now"") without method keeps this in IDEATION.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and ""I honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning."" Phrases like ""end it all"" and ""wouldn't wake up"" directly reference suicide or death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The timing is immediate and specific: ""failed twice in the last 4 days"" and ""yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" indicate recent, concrete actions within a short timeframe (past 4 days, with the most recent attempt yesterday).

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is described: taking ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" as a means to attempt suicide. This shows preparation and execution of a plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post describes completed suicide attempts: ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and the detailed account of taking pills yesterday (""I took..."") with the intent to die (""hoped I wouldn't wake up""). These are past actions taken with the goal of ending life, regardless of outcome (he survived).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""I want to die""), and a specific method is mentioned (overdose on pills). However, the key element is the description of a past completed suicide attempt (""yesterday I took...""), which falls under the ATTEMPT category. The rules state that if a post describes a past completed action with intent to die, it is classified as ATTEMPT, even if it failed. The ""failed twice"" references also support this, but the pill-taking is a clear, detailed attempt.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post expresses deep distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""Why did I have to get such a horrible life,"" ""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse,"" ""I have nothing"").  
   - However, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die. Phrases like ""want to kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""be dead,"" or similar are absent. General expressions of suffering (e.g., ""Life is a curse"") do not qualify as explicit suicide content per the framework.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language is general and reflective, focusing on ongoing life struggles (e.g., ""my whole life,"" ""whenever I complain""). There are no immediate or time-bound indicators like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to"" related to suicide. References to past events (e.g., bullying, family issues) are about life experiences, not suicide actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The content discusses societal and personal issues (e.g., work, relationships, culture) without any allusions to plans for self-harm.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post references being ""bullied, harassed, treated like shit"" but does not describe any personal actions taken toward suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the classification must be INDICATOR based on the rule: ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR.""  
   - The post fits INDICATOR as it centers on severe distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction without crossing into explicit suicidal ideation, plans, or actions.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: All expressions are implicit distress (e.g., ""Life is a curse"")—no explicit suicide language.  
- When in Doubt: No ambiguity with IDEATION since no suicide is mentioned; INDICATOR is clear.  
- Focus: Only the author's experiences are relevant; no references to others' actions.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I'm feeling suicidal,"" ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more,"" and ""I feel like the only escape to this situation is suicide."" These are clear expressions of wanting to die or commit suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post references current distress (e.g., ""I am getting panic attacks,"" ""I'm not able to sleep properly"") and an event happening today (""I am going to get to know what is the decision of the management today""). However, there are no immediate or specific timing indicators for suicidal actions (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"" in relation to suicide).

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or locations are mentioned. The post discusses suicidal thoughts and feelings but does not describe any plans, preparations, or research into methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The focus is on current thoughts and emotional distress.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are present (e.g., ""feeling suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""only escape is suicide""), but there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation. Based on the framework, this fits IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit suicide content is present, ruling out INDICATOR.  
- No plan/method mentioned, ruling out BEHAVIOR.  
- No past attempt described, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
- Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR: No method or plan, so IDEATION is appropriate.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide, death wishes, or ending life:  
   - ""I know the way I will end it"" (implies suicide).  
   - References to ""suicide ideation"" directly.  
   - ""wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"" (explicit method of suicide).  
   - ""How do I stay on the tracks?"" (indicates intent to die by train).  
   - ""I really do not want to do this"" but still expresses the desire, which counts as explicit suicide content per rules.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current/immediate: Phrases like ""I am left wanting to jump,"" ""I know the train schedule,"" and ""How do I stay on the tracks?"" show present intent and urgency.  
   - Past events: Mentions ""the times I have tried"" (interrupted attempts) and ""the first time I actually attempted"" (completed past attempt).  
   - General/ongoing: Describes ""accumulated trauma"" and ongoing distress.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"" (train as a method).  
   - Specific location: References train tracks and living close to them.  
   - Preparations: ""I know the train schedule pretty well"" indicates research and planning.  
   - Seeking: ""How do I stay on the tracks?"" is asking for help to overcome hesitation.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Past attempts: Explicitly states ""the first time I actually attempted"" (a completed past action that involved 911 intervention).  
   - Interrupted attempts: Describes ""the times I have tried"" where ""fight or flight kicks in and I jump away,"" which are interrupted actions.  
   - Self-harm: Not explicitly mentioned, but interrupted attempts imply behavioral elements.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (e.g., ""suicide ideation,"" ""jump in front of a train""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Specific plans/methods are mentioned (train, schedule, tracks), so it cannot be IDEATION alone.  
   - A past completed suicide attempt is described (""the first time I actually attempted""), which directly triggers the ATTEMPT category per rules.  
   - Critical rule: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" Here, the post includes both a past attempt and current plans (e.g., knowing the schedule, wanting to jump).  
   - Interrupted actions (jumping away) are classified as BEHAVIOR, but the completed past attempt overrides this for classification.  
   - Final decision: ATTEMPT, as the post describes a concrete past action with intent to die.

**SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
The post mentions feelings of being a burden, isolation (""haven't left the house since 14""), unemployment, and stagnation (""lay in bed all day""). There is **no explicit mention** of suicide, death wishes, or phrases like ""want to die"" or ""end my life.""  

**URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**

- Expresses severe distress/hopelessness but lacks any suicidal intent, plan, or action.  
- Fulfills INDICATOR criteria: distress without explicit death/suicide mentions.

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation. There's nothing there for me and nobody wants me to be there either. I don't even want to be there. I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life tbh",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes. Specifically:  
   - ""I can kill myself on graduation night"" directly references suicide.  
   - ""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life"" expresses a desire to die and end life, with an implied method.  
   Phrases like ""I don't have much to live for"" or general distress are present, but the explicit suicide references trigger further analysis.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The timing is future-oriented and conditional: ""I promised myself that if things don't get better, I can kill myself on graduation night."" This specifies a future event (graduation night) but is not immediate (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").  
   - There are no past suicide attempt references; the focus is on future intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is described: ""stick some knives through my stomach,"" which is a concrete suicide method.  
   - A specific timing/plan is outlined: ""on graduation night,"" indicating preparation and intent.  
   - No explicit mentions of research, acquiring means, or interrupted actions, but the method and timing details constitute a plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No descriptions of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. References to ""I tried going to the school"" relate to seeking help, not suicide actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There is a specific plan/method (knives and graduation night), so it cannot be IDEATION (which requires no plan).  
   - This fits BEHAVIOR (explicit thoughts + plan/method). It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed actions are described.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit mentions like ""kill myself"" and ""stick knives"" are clear.  
     - Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to method/plan.  
     - No past attempts, so not ATTEMPT.

341,"It's settled. I've spent the past few days researching tall bridges in the place I'm staying (I'm on holiday), and looking for any further help anywhere I can. It doesn't seem to exist, not for me anyway. Decided to push through the holiday but commit when i get home. I have a few methods to try, I've already drafted my suicide notes. It's settled. I can't anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step-by-Step Analysis Using Framework

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions include: ""commit when i get home"" (where ""commit"" implies suicide), ""suicide notes"" (direct reference to suicide), and ""I have a few methods to try"" (indicating intent to die). Phrases like ""I can't anymore"" suggest distress but are not explicit on their own; however, in context, they support the suicidal theme.  
   - **Conclusion:** Explicit suicide/death wishes are present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Future-oriented timing: ""commit when i get home"" (after the holiday) indicates a planned action, not immediate (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").  
   - Past actions: ""spent the past few days researching tall bridges"" and ""already drafted my suicide notes"" show completed preparations.  
   - **Conclusion:** No immediate urgency, but concrete past preparations for future action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods: ""researching tall bridges"" implies jumping as a method, and ""I have a few methods to try"" confirms multiple methods.  
   - Specific locations: ""tall bridges in the place I'm staying"" identifies a location.  
   - Preparations: ""drafted my suicide notes"" is a clear preparation step.  
   - Research/seeking: ""researching tall bridges"" and ""looking for any further help"" (in context, likely seeking methods or confirming lack of alternatives) indicate active planning.  
   - **Conclusion:** Detailed plans, methods, and preparations are present.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried"" or actions like overdosing).  
   - Preparations like researching and note-drafting are not classified as attempts; they are part of planning.  
   - No interrupted attempts (e.g., no description of starting and stopping an action).  
   - **Conclusion:** No history of attempts or self-harm actions; only planning behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from Step 1), AND specific plans/methods/preparations are detailed (from Step 3).  
   - According to the classification rules:  
     - Explicit thoughts + plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR  
   - Not IDEATION because methods and preparations are specified.  
   - Not ATTEMPT because no past completed actions are described (e.g., no actual overdose or jump).  
   - Not INDICATOR because suicide is explicitly mentioned.  
   - **Critical Rules Application:**  
     - Explicit vs. Implicit: ""Commit"" and ""suicide notes"" are explicit.  
     - When in doubt: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to method/plan mentions (e.g., bridges, notes, multiple methods).  
     - Focus on the writer: All content refers to the poster themselves.  

**Final Decision:** Classification is BEHAVIOR due to explicit suicidal intent combined with specific plans (bridge research), methods (multiple), and preparations (drafted notes).

342,"I'm free. It looks like I'm finally free to end it all. For years I felt like I couldn't kill myself because I had to ""stay alive for"" my friends. Well, I don't have anyone worth staying alive for anymore. Looks like I'm finally free to commit lifen't. This is a blessing. Finally moving forward and looking into my options to end it all. Of course there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it, but I need to have the option to end it all. So, with those obstacles out of the way, I'm free to get cracking. I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row, and once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision. Live or die. This is a weight off my chest. It could finally be my time. If I decide to end it I'll be sure to wish you all a farewell. Goodbye for now!",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including: ""end it all,"" ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't"" (a euphemism for suicide), ""option to end it all,"" ""ready to end it,"" ""live or die,"" and ""decide to end it."" Phrases like ""Goodbye for now"" and ""wish you all a farewell"" reinforce the context of ending life. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language indicates current and ongoing intent rather than immediate action. Key phrases include ""finally free to end it all,"" ""finally moving forward,"" ""looking into my options,"" and ""getting my ducks in a row."" Words like ""finally"" and ""could finally be my time"" suggest preparation is underway, but there is no specific immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The post also references past feelings (""for years I felt like I couldn't kill myself"") but no past actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is evidence of research and preparation: ""looking into my options"" explicitly indicates seeking information about suicide methods, and ""getting my ducks in a row"" implies concrete preparations (e.g., organizing means or setting affairs in order). However, no specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or locations are mentioned. This aligns with the BEHAVIOR category, which includes ""seeking information about suicide methods"" and ""describing preparations.""

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post only discusses past reasons for not acting (e.g., ""stay alive for friends"") but no actual actions taken. This rules out ATTEMPT classification.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill myself""), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - There is evidence of planning/preparation (""looking into my options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row""), which moves it beyond IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Applying the critical rules: ""looking into my options"" qualifies as seeking information about methods, which is explicitly under BEHAVIOR. When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if any method/plan is mentioned.

**Final Classification Rationale:**  
The post expresses explicit suicidal intent with clear indications of research and preparation, falling under BEHAVIOR. There are no past attempts, and the focus is on current planning.

'Wow I really want to take care of myself and help myself' overnight?. Like what is this fairy land? Fuck. 'Get a therapist' yeah when you're constantly suicidal, helping yourself isn't really much of an option you consider. How the fuck am I supposed to develop some positive outlook from a therapy office when I am not even in the proper perspective? It's all bullshit. People like me are sick. I should be allowed assisted suicide. It's twice as worse to tell me to stay and suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including: ""I want to kill myself,"" ""Wow I need to kill myself,"" ""constantly suicidal,"" and ""I should be allowed assisted suicide."" These phrases directly reference suicide and wanting to die, meeting the criteria for explicit content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language indicates ongoing, general suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""constantly suicidal""), but there are no immediate or specific timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The focus is on persistent distress rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or plans are described. The mention of ""assisted suicide"" is a general concept or wish, not a detailed personal plan, preparation, or method. There is no evidence of research, locations, or active preparations.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** No references to past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses thoughts and feelings, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""I want to kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., assisted suicide is not elaborated as a personal actionable plan), so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan or method, the classification is IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied: Explicit phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" are sufficient for IDEATION, even in the context of distress. ""Assisted suicide"" is interpreted as an expression of desire, not a specific plan, so it does not elevate to BEHAVIOR.

344,Gonna end myself soon. Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""gonna end myself soon,"" which directly refers to suicide and wanting to die. It also includes ""to OD on,"" indicating a desire to die by overdose.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""soon"" suggests a near-future timeframe, but it is not immediate (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). This indicates current suicidal intent but not necessarily imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post specifies a method—overdosing (""OD"")—with exact quantities of Benadryl (1g) and Prozac (1g). Having the drugs (""Have 1g..."") shows preparation and possession of means.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past attempts or actions (e.g., ""I tried""). The focus is on current plans and preparations.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""end myself"").  
   - A specific method (overdose) and preparation (having the drugs) are mentioned.  
   - According to the rules, explicit thoughts with plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.  
   - This is not an ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described; it's future-oriented planning.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit suicide content is clear.  
- No past attempt is indicated.  
- Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, BEHAVIOR is chosen due to the method and preparation details.  
- The classification is for the author only.

345,"I'm Lonely. I don't know why but I'm constantly feeling alone. When I was in kinder I was always bullied and I didn't really make much friends. The neighbors that I had before were my playmates, but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I'm sorry if this was too long a read.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes:  
     - ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life"" (implies intent to self-harm or suicide).  
     - ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood"" (explicit visualization of death).  
     - ""suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it"" (direct expression of current suicidal intent).  
   - Phrases like ""I couldn't cut"" and ""not going through with it"" still involve explicit suicide context.  
   - **Conclusion:** Explicit suicide/death wishes are present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current/immediate: ""Right now"" (referencing loneliness, not suicide timing), ""I feel like I just need to do it"" (suggests ongoing desire but no specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""now"").  
   - Past events: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life"" (past actions).  
   - General/ongoing: ""I constantly imagine"" (ongoing suicidal thoughts).  
   - **Conclusion:** No immediate urgency indicators; focus is on past actions and ongoing thoughts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods: ""knife to my wrist"" and ""dead in a pool of my own blood"" (explicit method involving cutting/bleeding).  
   - Preparations: ""had a knife to my wrist"" (physical preparation with a means).  
   - No mention of specific locations, research, or future plans.  
   - **Conclusion:** Specific method (knife) and preparations are mentioned.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Past actions: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x"" and ""each time I couldn't cut"" (initiated actions but stopped, making them interrupted attempts).  
   - Self-harm behaviors: Knife to wrist implies self-harm with suicidal intent.  
   - No description of completed suicide attempts (e.g., actual injury or hospitalization).  
   - **Conclusion:** Interrupted attempts (behavior) are present, not completed attempts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., wanting to die, needing to commit suicide).  
   - Specific method (knife) and preparations are mentioned, along with interrupted attempts.  
   - According to rules:  
     - Interrupted actions (e.g., putting knife to wrist but not cutting) classify as BEHAVIOR.  
     - ""Imagine my family seeing me dead"" reinforces method but is not a plan; however, combined with knife incidents, it supports BEHAVIOR.  
     - No completed past attempt (""couldn't cut"" means no action was finalized).  
   - Rule application:  
     - Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR because a method (knife) and interrupted actions are mentioned.  
     - Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Not ATTEMPT because actions were not completed (no cutting occurred).  
   - **Conclusion:** Classification is BEHAVIOR due to explicit thoughts, specific method, and interrupted attempts.

If I told you everything I have been through and everything I have done to others, is there any hope of still being loved despite it? I would like to feel that before I kill myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" in the phrase: ""I would like to feel that before I kill myself."" This is a direct reference to suicide, meeting the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""before I kill myself"" implies a conditional future action (wanting to feel loved first), but lacks immediate timing words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""today."" It expresses a desire rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging), location (e.g., bridge), preparation (e.g., writing a note), or research. The reference to suicide is general and lacks concrete details about how, when, or where.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post describes past ""fucked up stuff"" and actions toward others, but there is no reference to past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself""), interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The suicide reference is entirely future-oriented.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""kill myself"") are present, but without any plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. According to the decision logic:  
     - Explicit suicide thoughts + no plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - The conditional phrasing (""before I kill myself"") does not change this, as it still lacks specificity for BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide confirms IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
- No method/plan means it does not qualify for BEHAVIOR.  
- No past action means it does not qualify for ATTEMPT.  
- Focus is solely on the author's expressed thoughts.

I've always had a solution to my issues when I was younger, like putting a bandaid on a scratch or finding a way to get out of detention. Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide. You can't fix that shit.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""the thought of suicide"" in the line: ""Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide."" This is a direct reference to suicide, indicating explicit suicidal thoughts. Phrases like ""Fuck life, I'm out"" could imply distress but are not explicit on their own; however, the explicit mention of ""suicide"" qualifies under the framework.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""now"" in ""Now instead of a scratch..."" suggests the suicidal thoughts are current and ongoing. There are no immediate timing indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""today"") indicating imminent action, and no past attempts are described—only current thoughts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research. The post only refers to ""the thought of suicide"" in a general sense, with no details on how it might be acted upon.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The reference to past solutions (""putting a bandaid on a scratch"") is unrelated to suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""the thought of suicide""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past suicide attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicidal thoughts but no plan/method, it fits IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit mention of ""suicide"" triggers IDEATION per rules, even if it's framed as a thought.  
- Intrusive thoughts (""the thought of suicide"") are still classified as IDEATION.  
- No doubt between categories: Explicit mention rules out INDICATOR; lack of plan rules out BEHAVIOR; no past action rules out ATTEMPT.

Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write. Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful and even more so to the ones that's suffered so much. For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts: ""my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace?"" and ""It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal."" The phrase ""what if I wasn't in this world"" implies death or non-existence, and ""becoming suicidal"" directly references suicide ideation. Even though the person states they didn't act on these thoughts (""Never really thought I would act it out""), the explicit mention of suicide/death wishes still counts based on the rules.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The suicidal content is described in the past tense (e.g., ""During lockdown,"" ""I was very depressed,"" ""At some point my thoughts came""). There are no current/immediate indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now""; the post reflects on a previous period of distress.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or research are mentioned. The person explicitly states they never intended to act (""Never really thought I would act it out""), and there is no reference to methods, locations, or actions.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post only discusses thoughts and feelings, not concrete actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""becoming suicidal""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. Therefore, based on the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""  
   - The past tense does not change the classification, as historical ideation still falls under IDEATION. The absence of any behavior or attempt elements rules out BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT.  
   - Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen because of the explicit suicide mention, per the critical rule: ""Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention.""

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""end myself,"" ""end it,"" and ""overdose,"" which are direct references to suicide or death wishes. Phrases like ""try to end myself"" indicate a desire to die.
2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The use of ""tonight"" (repeated twice) and ""again tonight"" signals current/immediate intent, indicating the person plans to act soon.
3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The method is specified as ""overdose,"" which is a concrete plan for suicide. The word ""try"" implies preparation or intent to act.
4. **ACTION HISTORY:** The word ""again"" suggests past behavior, but the post focuses on current plans (""gonna try tonight"") rather than describing a completed past attempt. No details of a past action (e.g., ""I overdosed last week"") are provided.
5. **DECISION LOGIC:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""end myself"").
   - A specific method (""overdose"") is mentioned, indicating a plan.
   - This fits BEHAVIOR (explicit thoughts + plan/method).
   - Not ATTEMPT because no completed past action is described; the post is about future intent.
   - Not IDEATION because a method is specified.
   - Not INDICATOR due to explicit suicide content.

My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions related to death and dying: ""I think my time on this earth is coming to an end in the next month or two,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" and ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all."" These phrases indicate a personal expectation and acceptance of death, which, in the context of distress about life's pain (""I can't fight anymore,"" ""life and its pain""), constitute explicit death wishes. The metaphor of a cat going to die reinforces this. Although the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the references to personal death are direct and contextualized by hopelessness, meeting the criteria for explicit mention.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The timeframe ""in the next month or two"" suggests future-oriented intent but is not immediate (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). There are no past events (e.g., ""I tried"") or interrupted actions described. The tone conveys ongoing distress (""I can't fight anymore,"" ""so tired""), but the key indicator is the anticipation of death within a specific period.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or research are mentioned. The cat metaphor implies a desire to die alone but does not detail a concrete plan or method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on future expectations and current feelings, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present, so it is not INDICATOR.
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - No past suicide attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die or end life without specific plans or methods.

**Critical Rules Application:**
- Explicit death wishes in distress context are sufficient for IDEATION (per Explicit vs. Implicit rule).
- No method/plan means not BEHAVIOR (per When in Doubt rule: IDEATION if no method).
- Focus is on the author's current/future state, not past actions.
- Risk is for the author only.

352,Even when the 'fog' has lifted I still have no interest in modern life. I get windows of relief which is nice.but yet suicidal thoughts constantly round and round. I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day. What's really worrying is I'm 26 now and each year has got worse yes there's lots of factors but there's levels of depression I didn't think we're possible. As you all well know,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round,"" which directly references suicide and wanting to die. This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide content, as it includes phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" indicating a desire to end life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language describes ongoing, persistent thoughts (""constantly,"" ""round and round,"" ""over 100 times a day""), but there are no immediate or time-bound indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The focus is on chronic, recurring experiences rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The user states they ""contemplate method over 100 times a day."" The word ""method"" explicitly refers to considering specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), which falls under plan/method assessment. This is not just general ideation but involves active contemplation of how to carry out suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses current thoughts and contemplation, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal thoughts"").  
   - A plan/method is mentioned (""contemplate method""), indicating specific consideration of suicide methods.  
   - According to the rules, explicit thoughts plus any method/plan reference should be classified as BEHAVIOR.  
   - This is not ATTEMPT because no past completed actions are described.  
   - Critical rule application: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because a method is mentioned.

353,"Please help, I'm at my rope's end. Basically,. I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me). I was loyal and did that. &amp;#x200B;. And suffered through all of this hell because of that decision",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I jsut want to die."" This directly expresses a desire to die/end life.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate timing words (""tonight,"" ""now"") linked to suicidal intent. Distress is ongoing (""feel like I'll be here for a long timer""), but no urgency tied to suicide.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of methods (pills, weapons), locations (bridge), preparations (notes), or research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No references to past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wish (""I want to die"") is present → Cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Cannot be BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.  
   - Classification: **IDEATION** (explicit wish to die without specific plan/action).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""I want to die"" is explicit, overriding general distress.  
- No method/plan shifts it away from BEHAVIOR.  
- Past trauma/family issues don’t change classification.

354,I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm a fuck up who can never get anything right. I feel like my mom thinks I'm a genuinely stupid human being who can't think for herself. I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree. I want to tell a suicide hotline but I don't want to be locked up in a mental facility and never be able to get out. I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent through the phrase ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree,"" which directly relates to ending life. This is an expression of wanting to die, as it describes a method to cause death. Additionally, the reference to contacting a suicide hotline confirms the context of suicide risk.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""right now"" indicates current and immediate timing, as the person is actively considering the action while sitting in their car. There are no past events described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is mentioned: ""driving 100 mph into a tree."" This qualifies as a concrete plan involving a method (high-speed collision) and implies a location (wherever the car is positioned). No explicit preparations or research are described, but the method is clearly specified.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current thoughts and feelings.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (wanting to die via driving into a tree).  
   - A specific method is included (driving into a tree), which moves this beyond general ideation.  
   - According to the rules: Explicit suicide thoughts + specific method → BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - The ambivalence (e.g., not wanting to be locked up) does not change the classification, as the explicit suicidal thought with a plan takes precedence.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The phrase ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" is explicit and includes a method, satisfying the BEHAVIOR criteria.  
- Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR: The specific method mentioned requires classification as BEHAVIOR.  
- The risk pertains only to the author, and no other individuals are mentioned.

355,"I did a horrible thing to the woman I love. We started off a bit complicated, my mum is dying from cancer and at the start I told her that I cant commit to a relationship because I wasn't in the right headspace. That was fine at first but she wanted more and so did i. But I was weak and looked for comfort in an ex. I put a stop to it again and again but everytime something got hard with my family I kept running to the other woman for support. I knew it was wrong and I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much. We were together for two years. But she found out about the previous incident and left. I am fully responsible for everything that happened. Im so regretful and sorry for hurting her. My mum is in her final couple of weeks, im her primary carer and I dont know how to process any of it. She will be leaving my little brother who is autistic in my care. I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously. I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes:  
   - ""I've struggled with suicide before."" (direct reference to suicide)  
   - ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well."" (""joining her"" implies a desire to die, contextualized with suicide history)  
   - ""im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing"" (""passing"" means death, expressing anticipation of self-inflicted death).  
   This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Past events: ""I was hospitalised for it previously"" indicates a historical suicide-related incident.  
   - Future intent: ""I will be joining her as well"" suggests a contingent plan tied to the mother's passing (in ""final couple of weeks""), but lacks immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").  
   - General hopelessness: ""I dont see any future ahead for me"" indicates ongoing distress but no specific timeline.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are described for current suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""I will be joining her"" is vague and lacks actionable details.  
   - Past hospitalization implies a method was involved historically, but it is not specified in the post.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Explicit description of a past suicide attempt: ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" Hospitalization typically follows a concrete action with intent to die, qualifying as a completed past suicide attempt under the framework (regardless of outcome).  
   - No current or interrupted actions described (e.g., no mention of recent self-harm or preparations).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from Step 1), but no current plan/method is identified (Step 3). This would typically suggest IDEATION.  
   - However, the post describes a past suicide attempt (""I was hospitalised for it previously""), which directly maps to the ATTEMPT category per the classification rules: ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT"".  
   - Critical rules clarify that if a past attempt is mentioned (even alongside current ideation), classify as ATTEMPT. Here, the past attempt is the clearest and highest-risk element.

**Final Classification Rationale:**  
The presence of a described past suicide attempt (hospitalization) overrides current suicidal ideation without a plan. Per the framework, ATTEMPT is the correct category.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains expressions of extreme distress (""My mind is hell,"" ""tired of living,"" ""hopeless"") and despair (""Nothing makes it go away"").  
   - **No explicit mentions** of suicide, death wishes, or phrases like ""want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life."" The closest phrase is ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it,"" but ""stop it"" is vague and not explicitly tied to suicide/death.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - General/ongoing distress (""last few months,"" ""every night,"" ""cycling over and over"") but **no immediate timing cues** (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - **No references** to methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Describes efforts to cope (therapy, Prozac, new activities) but **no past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions**.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - **No explicit suicide/death wishes** → Falls under INDICATOR. Distress and hopelessness are present, but all expressions are about emotional pain, not ending life.  
   - Critical rules applied: ""Stop it"" is ambiguous and not explicit; no plan/attempt references. When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION **only** if suicide is explicit (here, it is not).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""constantly contemplate suicide"" and expresses a death wish with ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all."" These phrases directly reference suicide and not wanting to be alive, fulfilling the criteria for explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The contemplation of suicide is described as ""constantly,"" indicating an ongoing or general state rather than immediate urgency (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). The post focuses on persistent feelings of depression and hopelessness without time-sensitive plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The content remains at the level of thoughts and desires without actionable details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post references past life events (e.g., ""I tried making some art"") but no history of suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions. The phrase ""constantly contemplate suicide"" refers to thoughts, not actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""contemplate suicide"" and death wishes), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. This fits the IDEATION category. No past suicide attempt is mentioned, ruling out ATTEMPT. The distress and hopelessness are severe but include explicit suicide content, so INDICATOR does not apply. There is no evidence for BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- ""Contemplate suicide"" is an explicit expression, so IDEATION applies even without intent to act.  
- No ambiguity: Explicit suicide content with no plan/method confirms IDEATION over other categories.  
- Focus is solely on the author's experiences.

I'm not looking for sympathy or compassion really I'm just looking to know if anyone else feels like the release is better as their life is a bust. To say hey jesus or whatever I had an impossible situation can I go back?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the phrase ""When to know if suicide is better."" It also references ""the release"" as a euphemism for death or ending life, and phrases like ""life is a bust"" and ""can I go back?"" imply a desire to escape or undo existence. This constitutes explicit suicide-related content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no immediate urgency indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The language is reflective and general, focusing on long-term suffering (e.g., ""lived for years with trauma,"" ""since I was 12 or 13"") rather than current plans. The question ""When to know if suicide is better"" suggests contemplation, not imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post asks if others feel ""the release is better,"" but this is a philosophical query, not a practical plan or method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses life circumstances (e.g., trauma, abuse) but no actions taken toward suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicide"" and related concepts), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die or considering suicide without specific plans or methods.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions a desire to die through the phrase ""I wanna go sleep forever,"" which is a euphemism for ending one's life. This aligns with expressions like ""want to be gone"" or ""don't want to survive"" in the framework. Additionally, the person states ""can't take this shit no more"" and ""sick and tired of my shitty life,"" indicating severe distress, but the key is the explicit death wish.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""I wanna go sleep"" suggests a current desire, but there are no specific urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The timing is general/ongoing, focusing on the present state of distress rather than an immediate timeline.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post includes specific methods and preparations: the person lists exact quantities and types of medication (""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg""). This indicates possession of means for a potential overdose, which qualifies as a specific suicide method and preparation under the BEHAVIOR category.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The post describes current intentions and possessions, not historical events.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I wanna go sleep forever"").  
   - A specific plan/method is also mentioned (pills with quantities).  
   - Therefore, based on the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.""  
   - No past attempt is described, so ATTEMPT does not apply.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- ""I wanna go sleep forever"" is explicit in context, so INDICATOR is ruled out.  
- Method (pills) is specified, so IDEATION is insufficient; BEHAVIOR applies.  
- No completed past action, so not ATTEMPT.  
- The risk is for the person posting, and no ambiguity exists between categories.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes: ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive."" These phrases directly indicate a desire to not be alive, which falls under explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language is general and ongoing (e.g., ""I'm depressed,"" ""I'm miserable,"" ""I'm tired of being alive"") with no immediate time references (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past actions described. The distress is present but not urgent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or research are mentioned. The focus is on emotional pain and life circumstances.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses feelings (e.g., depression, misery) but no concrete actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**

   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit death wishes but no plan or action, it must be classified as IDEATION.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide-related actions and desires: ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times,"" ""I tried with a knife,"" ""I have a rope,"" ""I have to do it,"" ""I want this to end."" Phrases like ""tried with a knife"" and ""have a rope"" directly reference suicide methods, and ""I want this to end"" implies a desire for life to end in context.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current intent is indicated by ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have to do it,"" and ""I should've done it a long time ago,"" showing present desire. Past events are clear: ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times"" and ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods are mentioned: knife (past) and rope (current). A location is referenced (""There's a building""), and preparations are implied by ""I have a rope."" However, the person hasn't acted on the current plan (""I never checked out the place"").

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Past suicide attempts are explicitly described: ""I tried with a knife"" (a completed action with intent, despite failure) and ""bailed out multiple times"" (interrupted actions). ""Tried with a knife"" qualifies as a past completed attempt regardless of outcome.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present, so not INDICATOR.  
   - Specific methods and plans are mentioned, so not IDEATION.  
   - Past suicide attempts are described (""tried with a knife""), which fits the ATTEMPT category. The rule states: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" Current elements like ""I have a rope"" do not override this, as ATTEMPT takes precedence for past completed actions.  
   - Interrupted actions (""bailed out"") are BEHAVIOR, but the explicit past attempt (""tried with a knife"") is ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains the phrase ""i just want to end it,"" which is an explicit expression of wanting to end life or die. This fits the criteria for explicit suicide/death wishes, as ""end it"" is a common euphemism for suicide in contexts of distress, similar to ""want it to be over"" or ""want to be gone."" Other content (e.g., ""No point to anything in life,"" ""I feel pain,"" ""useless"") indicates hopelessness and depression but does not negate the explicit mention of wanting to end life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no indicators of immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past events (e.g., ""I tried""). The phrase ""want to"" suggests a general or ongoing desire rather than a specific timeline.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**

   The phrase ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" explicitly expresses a wish for death (not waking up = being dead). This qualifies as a suicide/death mention.

   - Explicit suicide/death wish present → Not INDICATOR.  
   - Past attempt described (""attempt properly again"") → Triggers ATTEMPT classification per rules (regardless of current plans).  
   - Critical Rule 4: Past attempts override current ideation/behavior.

364,Can someone harvest my organs?. Hi i am looking for someone to kill me and hide my body so that my family will never find out. I am happy for u to chop me up as long as i never get found again,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill me"", ""hide my body"", ""chop me up"", ""i never get found again"".  
   - Directly expresses desire for death and body disposal.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Present-tense intent: ""I am looking for someone"", ""I am happy for u to"".  
   - Indicates active, current desire.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: Hiring someone to kill and dismember them.  
   - Preparations: Soliciting assistance, planning body concealment.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past attempts or actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide intent + specific method/preparation → **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - *Critical Rule Application*: ""Looking for someone to kill me"" constitutes a plan with method (proxy killing + dismemberment), overriding IDEATION.

365,"I'm fed up with it. It's now going on 10 years that I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts. Circumstances have changed, I've had great highs and rock bottom lows, but none of it matters. Every fucking day, something just snaps on in my head and then I'm fantasizing about my death. I fight to suppress them; some days are easier than others. Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here. I have no desire to die. But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death,"" and ""consider it"" (referring to suicide). Phrases like ""fighting down suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death"" directly reference death/suicide wishes.  
   - Even though the person states ""I have no desire to die,"" the explicit mentions of suicide-related content still count according to the framework rules (e.g., intrusive thoughts like ""my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to"" are classified as IDEATION).

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The timing is general/ongoing, with phrases like ""going on 10 years,"" ""every fucking day,"" and ""some days."" There are no immediate indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The content focuses on thoughts and fantasies without concrete plans (e.g., no references to pills, jumping, or other methods).

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The statement ""I'm still here"" implies no prior attempts, but it does not detail any actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death""), but there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, based on the rules:  
     - This is not INDICATOR because there are explicit suicide/death mentions.  
     - This is not BEHAVIOR because no plan/method is indicated.  
     - This is not ATTEMPT because no past completed actions are described.  
     - The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts without plans aligns with IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules reinforce this: Intrusive thoughts (e.g., fighting thoughts but still having them) are IDEATION, and when in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, the absence of a method means IDEATION is chosen.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses ongoing suicidal ideation without evidence of plans, methods, or past attempts, fitting the IDEATION category.

366,"My problems are getting worse, and I just really wish to end my life, but I just can't. Every day, I'm struggling more and more with my problems. I was emotionally neglected by my parents, and searching for the love and attention I never got is the only thing keeping my alive. Every thing I do is controlled by this. It usually starts by seeing someone getting praised for something, which leads to me thinking that I need to be able to do/ have these things to be loved. Every time I see things as simple as a drawing, just gets me more and more depressed. I can't go to a therapist or something like that, because my mom's mad at me for being even sad in the slightest. I can't talk a single word about mental health at all, without being scared that she will scream at me another time. I feel like I'm unimportant. Other people have problems much worse than mine. They deserve being cared for, unlike me. Hearing other people's problems just makes me feel sad, and envious, because these people are getting all this love that I never got, and I never will get. I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this. The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest. I don't know why, but I just. can't.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I just really wish to end my life"", ""to just end all this""  
   - Clear expressions of death wishes: ""I want to be gone"" (implied by context)  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Ongoing distress (""Every day"", ""struggling more"") but **no immediate timeframe** (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"")  
   - Focus on chronic emotional pain and hopelessness  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - **No specific method** mentioned (e.g., pills, weapons)  
   - Explicitly states inability to act: ""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest""  
   - **No preparations**, locations, or research described  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions  
   - References emotional neglect and current suffering only  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide wish (""wish to end my life"") → Requires at least IDEATION  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** → Rules out BEHAVIOR

367,I lost control. I've lost control of my head I just want to cry I can't breathe I want to scream help please I don't want to live this again,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains phrases expressing distress (""I lost control,"" ""want to cry,"" ""can't breathe,"" ""want to scream"") and the statement ""I don't want to live this again."" While this expresses anguish and a desire to escape suffering, it **does NOT explicitly mention** suicide, death wishes (e.g., ""want to die,"" ""kill myself""), or ending life. ""Don’t want to live this"" refers to enduring a painful experience, not ending life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The distress is described in the present (""I just want to cry,"" ""I can’t breathe""), but there are no time-bound indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") tied to suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No references to past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. ""I don’t want to live this again"" implies reliving trauma, not a prior suicide attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   Since there is **no explicit mention of suicide or death wishes**, the post falls under **INDICATOR**. It expresses severe distress and hopelessness but lacks direct references to suicide, meeting the INDICATOR definition of ""expressing distress... WITHOUT explicit mention of suicide.""

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Don’t want to live this"" is interpreted as distress about circumstances, not a death wish (Rule 1: Explicit vs. Implicit).  
- No ambiguity requiring escalation to IDEATION (Rule 5: When in Doubt).

368,It's too hard. This is too hard I want to tell them everything not in writing but on the phone so they can hear the sincerity of my voice. My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex. It's this fucking sickness god it's horrible it's so goddamn horrible and I don't why this is happening to me. Of course I get my ex doesn't care about me and didn't care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isn't just my problem my trauma it's this sickness I've been carrying from before I even met her. And I'm tired because I'm a good person I know it's wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesn't listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship. I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it. And my mom didn't even tell my brother the whole truth. They can't keep hiding it and brushing it off. It's not helping!,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The phrase ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it"" explicitly references a suicide note, which directly implies intent to die. ""This is it"" strongly suggests a final decision to end life.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The note is described in the past tense (""I left""), indicating a completed preparatory action. No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight"") are used for current plans.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Leaving a suicide note is explicitly listed under **BEHAVIOR** as a ""preparation"" (writing notes). While no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned, the note itself qualifies as a concrete preparatory step.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The act of writing and leaving the note is a past completed action with suicidal intent. No prior attempts (e.g., overdosing) are described.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide intent is confirmed via the note.  
   - Preparations (note-writing) are present, meeting **BEHAVIOR** criteria.  
   - Not **ATTEMPT** because no description of a physical self-harm action (e.g., ingesting pills, jumping).  
   - **Critical Rules**: Note-writing = preparation → **BEHAVIOR**. ""When in doubt"" rule: Any plan/preparation overrides IDEATION.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""screamed that I wanted to die"", ""I just. Want. To die."", ""How do I kill myself""  
   - All express direct suicidal intent or death wishes.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Ongoing ideation: ""never been far away from my mind since"" (middle school)  
   - Current distress: ""I can't keep doing this anymore""  
   - No immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but active contemplation present.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Explicitly asks: ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?""  
   - This shows research/seeking for a specific method (minimizing impact on parents).  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Mentions past suicidal ideation (""screamed I wanted to die"") but no described past attempts.  
   - References being fired for ""being suicidal"" but no details of actions taken.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""want to die,"" ""kill myself"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - Specific method inquiry (""how do I kill myself"") → Elevates to BEHAVIOR (plan/research).  
   - No description of past completed suicide attempt → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - **Critical Rule**: Seeking methods = BEHAVIOR, even without immediate timeline.  

**Classification Reasoning**:  
- The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""want to die,"" ""kill myself"") AND active planning/research (""How do I kill myself...""), meeting BEHAVIOR criteria.  
- Falls under BEHAVIOR due to method-focused question despite lack of preparation details.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains phrases like ""push me over the edge,"" ""I'll be free from it all,"" ""eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" These imply a desire for release from suffering but **do not explicitly mention suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die** (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die"").  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - General/ongoing distress is present (""A lot of times,"" ""growing more and more dim""), but no immediate timing (""tonight,"" ""now"") or past attempts are described.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The phrase ""one last push"" is metaphorical and lacks concrete suicide planning.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - **No explicit suicide/death wishes** → Falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses severe hopelessness, worthlessness, and disillusionment with life (e.g., ""no point in it all,"" ""no future for myself""), but all references to escape remain abstract and lack direct suicide terminology.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Push me over the edge"" and ""eternal void"" are **implicit**, not explicit, expressions of distress (Rule 1).  
- No methods/plans → Cannot be BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT.  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION **only** if explicit suicide mention exists (none here).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post discusses suicide in a general context (""People who commit suicide"") and describes emotional distress (""bottled everything up,"" ""painful emotions,"" ""snap and break down""). However, there is no explicit mention of the author personally wanting to die, commit suicide, end their life, or express death wishes. The language is observational and third-person, focusing on why others might reach that point, not the author's own desires.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - No indicators of current/immediate risk (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past personal actions (e.g., ""I tried""). The post uses general terms like ""most of the time"" and ""one day,"" describing a hypothetical or collective experience without personal urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research by the author. The post is about emotional buildup in a broad sense, not planning or methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm by the author. References to ""people who commit suicide"" are about others, not the author's personal history.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit personal mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die by the author (only general discussion of others), this falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses distress and hopelessness but lacks any direct suicidal expression from the writer. Critical rules reinforce this: when no explicit suicide/death wish is present, choose INDICATOR, and the risk must correspond to the author, not others mentioned.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever,"" which are direct references to suicide and death. Phrases like ""I'd be dead"" also express a desire to be dead. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language uses conditional phrasing (""If I kill myself"") and general intent (""I just wanna leave""), but there are no specific time indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It expresses a desire but lacks immediacy.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The reference to leaving a ""giant middle finger"" is metaphorical and not a concrete plan or method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current thoughts and hypothetical future actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself,"" ""leave this world forever""), but no plan, method, or preparation is indicated. Therefore, based on the rules, this falls under IDEATION.  
   - Rules applied:  
     - Explicit mention of suicide → not INDICATOR.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains an explicit mention of death: ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" This is a direct expression of a death wish. Phrases like ""I am so tired of having to live"" and ""I can't fucking function in this world"" convey hopelessness but are not explicit on their own; however, the word ""Dead"" in context is an explicit reference to wanting to be dead.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The death wish (""Dead"") is framed in the future (""in five years""), not as an immediate or current plan (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). The post describes ongoing distress (e.g., ""constant state of anxiety and/or depression,"" ""I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread""), but no immediate suicidal timing.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The reference to death is vague and lacks concrete details about how it might occur.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors related to suicide. The post details personal struggles (e.g., failing college, poor hygiene) but these are not suicide-related actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wish is present (""Dead""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die or be dead without specific plans or methods.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Dead"" is explicit, so IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
- No method/plan, so not BEHAVIOR.  
- No past action, so not ATTEMPT.  
- Focus is solely on the author's own statements.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill their self"" and ""end their pain"" in the context of suicidal intent. This qualifies as explicit suicide content under the framework.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrasing is hypothetical/question-based (""If someone wants..."") with no current/immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight""). It references a general scenario, not the poster's present state.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The focus is on questioning motivations for intervention.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No descriptions of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""kill their self"") → Rules out **INDICATOR**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Rules out **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - No past attempt described → Rules out **ATTEMPT**.  
   - Explicit suicidal thought without plans → Matches **IDEATION** definition (e.g., questioning ""why shouldn’t I kill myself"" without method).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- The hypothetical phrasing still contains explicit suicide language.  
- ""Asking for a personal reason"" doesn’t negate the explicit mention.  
- Per rules: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention exists without plans.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide-related content: ""I been suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind,"" and ""will it instantly kill me."" Phrases like ""jumping in and drowning"" and ""put neck on the train tracks"" directly reference death and suicide methods.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current/ongoing indicators: ""Now I'm 16 depressed... suicide by a train is on my mind"" and ""every hour... suicide by a train is on my mind"" show persistent, ongoing thoughts.
   - Future timing: ""I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" indicates a specific future plan.
   - Past event: ""when I was 10 or 11... I thought jumping in and drowning... she convince me not to"" describes an interrupted past action (not a completed attempt).

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific method: ""suicide by a train"" and ""put neck on the train tracks"" explicitly describe a method.
   - Specific location: ""train tracks"" is identified.
   - Research/seeking: ""I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"" involves inquiry about method effectiveness.
   - Preparations: ""I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" indicates intention and planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Past interrupted attempt: ""I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning... she convince me not to"" is an interrupted action (initiated but stopped), which falls under BEHAVIOR per the rules. However, this is historical and not the focus for current classification.
   - No mention of a completed past attempt (e.g., no description of actual harm with intent to die that was carried out).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - There is a specific plan (""on my 18th birthday""), method (""train tracks""), and research (""will it instantly kill me""), so it meets criteria for BEHAVIOR.
   - The past event is an interrupted attempt (BEHAVIOR), but the current content (planning and method details) is the primary focus and also aligns with BEHAVIOR.
   - No completed past attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.
   - Per critical rules: Explicit death/suicide mention (rule 1) and method/plan presence (rule 5) confirm BEHAVIOR over IDEATION.

376,"Triggered by an attempt of someone else. I´ve had some suicidal thoughts through my life,  but most of them are behind me. I had a few rougher weeks lately and heard that someone who I know tried to end his life. Since then I keep thinking about it. It used to be something that wasn´t that ""real"" something I would think about, but it seemed more unattainable. It´s like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try. I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and phrases like ""end his life"" (referencing another person) and ""try it"" (referencing suicide). The author states they ""keep thinking about it"" (suicide) currently.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Thoughts are described as recurring (""keep thinking about it"") but lack immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight""). Past thoughts are noted as ""behind me,"" while current thoughts are triggered by an external event.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The author only references abstract consideration (""opens a window... it’s now ok to try"") without concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past personal attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. The only action mentioned is by another person (""someone who I know tried"").

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""thinking about it"" suicide).  
   - No plan/method/preparation is described.  
   - No past personal attempt is indicated.  
   - Classification aligns with **IDEATION** per rules: explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans/methods.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Suicidal thoughts"" is explicit suicide content, overriding INDICATOR.  
- ""Try it"" refers to the other person’s attempt, not the author’s actions.  
- The author’s ambivalence (""don’t want to think like this"") doesn’t negate explicit ideation.

377,"Stop please. I can't even do work, be productive, stay hydrated without having intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions, rage outbursts, followed by depressive episodes just want my life to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""just want my life to end"" explicitly expresses a desire for death, falling under ""wanting to die"" or ""not wanting to be alive"" per the framework.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past attempt references. The thoughts are described as ""constantly"" occurring, indicating ongoing/general distress.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wish (""want my life to end"") is present → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Confirms IDEATION (explicit desire without actionable details).  
   - Intrusive thoughts alone (""intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY"") still qualify as IDEATION per critical rules.

378,"not sure what to call this-. i don't know how to describe it, but it feels like i disassociate sometimes. granted, it could just be adhd stuff along with a part of my extreme dysphoria and never feeling like i'm the person i appear as; but, it doesn't feel like i'm in my body. like i'm simply watching someone work and live while i only watch. when others call for me or start conversations, it's like i'm not a part of it. i can't fully think when i talk or write, like i act without my own permission. i feel so disconnected from life in itself already, to the point where my emotions never act how i want. even when it came to serious topics such as my dog's passing or nearly killing myself one night, i don't feel really anything for it. i just sit there and watch people express themselves, not knowing what to do. when i see others sad or stressed, i can't feel the same or help. everything seems so far out of my touch, like it's not even real at some times. i can write things down or do something earlier that day, only to feel as if it were fake or like i wasn't actually doing it/there. this doesn't held that i lucid dream so often that, when i wake back up, real life feels more as a dream than my actual dreams. i zone out fairly often to the point of not realizing where i am or what i was doing prior. i want to talk to a therapist about it, but i have no money nor insurance to talk to one. not like i'd even trust a therapist fully with how trashy past ones have treated me. and i've already caused enough trouble for my parents. all i can do is watch days pass by without me even realizing it. dealing with constant bad moods from my dad, to the point where he throws things at times, and barely seeing my mom as she works. it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""nearly killing myself one night"" (direct suicide reference) and ""step off a building or over a bridge"" (death wish).  
   - Additional indicators: ""I want to be in control of myself"" contextualizes suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - Past event: ""nearly killing myself one night"" (confirmed past action).  
   - Future possibility: ""it'll only take one day"" (hypothetical/impulsive timing).

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Specific methods/locations: ""step off a building"" and ""over a bridge"" (clear methods and locations).  
   - No active preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) described.

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - Past action: ""nearly killing myself one night"" qualifies as an **interrupted attempt** (action initiated but stopped).

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""killing myself"") + specific methods (""building/bridge"") → **BEHAVIOR** for the future scenario.  
   - **However, the critical factor is the past ""nearly killing myself""**, which is an interrupted attempt (action initiated but not completed). Per Critical Rule 3, interrupted attempts are **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - The future hypothetical (""step off a building..."") reinforces BEHAVIOR but is secondary to the confirmed past action.

**Classification Rules Application**:  
- Interrupted attempt = BEHAVIOR (not ATTEMPT, as ATTEMPT requires a completed past action).  
- Future plan mention supports but doesn’t override past behavior classification.  
- *No ambiguity*: Explicit suicide content + past interrupted action = BEHAVIOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""i want to take myself out"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent (""take myself out"" is a common euphemism for suicide/death).  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   ""I want to"" indicates current desire (present tense), but no immediate time-bound words like ""tonight"" or ""now.""  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparation, or research mentioned. The person only expresses fear of pain (""scared it'll be painful"").  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thought is present (""take myself out"").  
   - No plan/method/preparation described.  
   - No past attempt mentioned.  
   → Classification aligns with **IDEATION** (explicit desire to die without specific plans/methods).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Take myself out"" is explicit suicide content (overrides general distress like ""not worth it anymore"").  
- Fear of pain doesn’t negate the explicit ideation.  
- No method/preparation → not BEHAVIOR.  
- No past action → not ATTEMPT.

380,Screw this. The more I live the more I want to die. Can't be fucked with anything anymore,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""want to die,"" which directly expresses a death wish. This falls under explicit suicide/death content as per the framework (e.g., ""wanting to die"" or ""not wanting to be alive"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrasing ""the more I live"" suggests a general/ongoing feeling rather than immediate urgency (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). It indicates a persistent desire but not tied to a specific time frame.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research. The post is vague about how the desire to die would be acted upon.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors (e.g., no references like ""I tried"" or specific actions taken).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""want to die"") are present, so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on the rules, this is classified as IDEATION (explicit desire to die without specifics).  
   - The ""when in doubt"" rule supports IDEATION over INDICATOR due to explicit mention, and no escalation to BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""thinking on how to die painlessly"" and ""I want to die."" These phrases directly express a desire to die.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timeline (""past 6+ months"") indicates ongoing contemplation, not immediate plans. No words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" are used.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The user describes researching methods (""thinking on how to die painlessly"") but explicitly states no method was found (""I have yet to find a way""). No specific methods, locations, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**

I have nothing and am on Reddit constantly. I have nothing to do and nothing I want to look at. I hate everything and everyone. I fucking hate.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it"" (where ""it"" contextually implies suicide), and ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years.""  
   - ""Must end this shit show"" and ""I'm very OVER this shit"" imply a desire to escape life but lack explicit death/suicide wording, so they alone wouldn't qualify.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").  
   - Suicide thoughts are described as chronic (""for 5 years pretty much nonstop""), indicating ongoing ideation without current urgency.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Mentions preparation: ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This shows concrete planning (drafting final communications).  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or locations referenced.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No past suicide attempts described (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or actions taken).  
   - Only references persistent thoughts, not actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""killing myself"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - Preparation (emails) is mentioned → This elevates it beyond IDEATION to BEHAVIOR per rules (""describing preparations"").  
   - No completed past attempt → Rules out ATTEMPT.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Emails to send... before I do it"" counts as preparation (BEHAVIOR category).  
- Intrusive thoughts (""thought about killing myself"") + preparation = BEHAVIOR.  
- No ambiguity between categories: Preparation explicitly moves it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""Ending it soon,"" which is a direct reference to suicide or ending one's life. This phrase, in the context of distress (""I'm so fucking depressed""), clearly indicates a wish to die.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""soon"" implies immediacy, and the action is tied to a specific event (""as soon as it gets here""), indicating a near-future timeline.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The person describes ordering ""14 grams of dextromethorphan"" (a specific method for overdose) and states they will take it all upon arrival. This shows clear planning, preparation, and acquisition of means.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of a past completed suicide attempt. The ""bad trip"" referenced appears to be a distressing experience but not a suicide action.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""Ending it soon"").  
   - A specific method (dextromethorphan overdose) and preparation (ordering it) are detailed.  
   - This fits the BEHAVIOR category, as it involves suicidal ideation with a concrete plan and preparatory actions.  
   - It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Ending it"" is an explicit death wish.

   - No explicit mentions of suicide, death wishes (e.g., ""want to die,"" ""kill myself""), or equivalent phrases.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - General timeframe (""60 years more"") with no immediate/imminent language (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").

   - No references to methods, locations, preparations, or research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past/current self-harm, attempts, or interrupted actions.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   The post mentions ""passive suicidal"" and ""suicide by cop"". These are explicit references to suicide concepts. However, the context is a general discussion about others' behavior (""someone who's passive suicidal""), not the author's personal experience.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   No current/personal urgency indicators (e.g., ""I feel suicidal now""). The language is hypothetical (""they may think"") and observational.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   ""Suicide by cop"" implies a method, but it's attributed to hypothetical others, not the author. No personal plans/preparations are described.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   No mention of the author's past attempts or self-harm actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide terms are used (""suicidal"", ""suicide by cop""), but **only in reference to other people**, not the author.  
   - The author expresses no personal desire to die, plans, or history of attempts.  
   - Per critical rules: Risk classification **only applies to the person writing the post**.  
   - Since the author mentions suicide concepts but **not in relation to themselves**, this meets the definition of **INDICATOR** (discussing distress/suicide abstractly without personal expression of intent).  

**Key Clarification**:  
- Phrases like ""passive suicidal"" describe a general state, not the author’s current feelings.  
- ""Suicide by cop"" is a method, but the author isn’t claiming it for themselves.  
- No personal suicidal ideation/behavior/attempt is expressed.

Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life and never told anyone because I hate being a burden. My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens and I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens. Getting the pens is too much of a hassle though. Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump if my condition goes south quick and, with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go. Had a couple ideas for how to do it, but getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible. Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit expressions related to suicide or death. Phrases like ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" and ""do it"" (in context, referring to suicide) indicate a direct mention of wanting to die or end life. ""Choose to go"" is a euphemism for suicide, and ""ideas for how to do it"" confirms the intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timing is future-oriented and conditional, not immediate. Words like ""might be"" and ""if it gets bad"" suggest planning for a potential future scenario (if the diabetes condition worsens). There are no indicators of current/imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). Past tense is used for thoughts (""Had a couple ideas,"" ""Thought about doing it""), but no immediate urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is described: using an insulin pump to administer a lethal overdose (""with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button""). The person also references accessibility and ease (""easiest and most accessible"") and mentions having ""a couple ideas"" for methods, indicating concrete planning. Preparation is implied through considering the pump as a means if their health declines.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of a past suicide attempt. The phrase ""almost went into shock"" refers to a medical incident, not an intentional act of self-harm or suicide. ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't"" confirms thoughts without action, so no attempt or interrupted attempt occurred.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from step 1).  
   - A specific plan/method is identified (from step 3), including preparation (considering the pump for suicide).  
   - No past attempt is described (from step 4).  
   Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR, as it involves suicidal ideation combined with a plan and method.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit phrases like ""choose to go"" count as suicide mentions.  
- The insulin pump method is specific, so BEHAVIOR over IDEATION applies.  
- No past attempt, so not ATTEMPT.  
- Focus is on the author's own risk.  
- When in doubt: Explicit mention and method favor BEHAVIOR.

### Step-by-Step Analysis Using the Framework

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" in the question ""ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday?"", and the user responds with ""well I do and I have a chance right now."" This directly expresses a desire to die by suicide. Phrases like ""kill yourself"" and ""I do"" (referring to wanting to kill oneself) are explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""right now"" indicates current/immediate timing, showing urgency. The context of it being the user's birthday today (""Worst birthday ever"") reinforces this as a present situation.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping), location (e.g., bridge), preparation (e.g., writing a note), or research. ""I have a chance right now"" suggests an opportunity but is vague and does not describe a concrete plan or method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post does not describe any past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried"") or self-harm behaviors. It focuses solely on current thoughts and feelings.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to kill yourself"" and ""I do""), but there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. Therefore, based on the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

### Applying Critical Classification Rules
- **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Kill yourself"" and ""I do"" are explicit, so it cannot be INDICATOR.
- **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable here, as the user is expressing personal desire, not attributing it to external thoughts.
- **Interrupted Actions:** No actions described, only thoughts and opportunity.
- **Past vs. Present:** Focus is on current desires (""right now""), with no past attempts mentioned.
- **When in Doubt:**  
  - Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR: No specific method/plan is mentioned (""have a chance"" is ambiguous but not detailed enough for BEHAVIOR), so IDEATION is chosen.  
  - No indication of ATTEMPT, as no completed past actions are described.

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal ideation without specific plans or methods, fitting the IDEATION category.

I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore.

This is a direct reference to suicidal thoughts. Phrases like ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit"" relate to death but are not explicit suicide mentions on their own; however, the ""considering suicide"" statement qualifies as an explicit expression.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The timing is current (""I'm finally considering suicide"") but not immediate or specific (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). It describes a recent development without a stated timeline for action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific suicide plan, method, location, preparation, or research is mentioned. The post focuses on distress and hopelessness but lacks details like pills, jumping, or any concrete steps toward suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The user states they never thought about suicide before, indicating no history of attempts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:** 
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""considering suicide""), but there is no plan or method described.
   - According to the rules, explicit thoughts without a plan/method fall under IDEATION.
   - Rules applied: 
     - Explicit mention requires classification as at least IDEATION (not INDICATOR).
     - No evidence for BEHAVIOR (no plan/method) or ATTEMPT (no past action).
     - Intrusive thoughts rule: ""Considering suicide"" is explicit, so IDEATION even if conflicted (e.g., ""I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents"" implies ambivalence, but the thought is still explicit).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicide and death wishes multiple times, including phrases like ""I just attempted to end my life,"" ""I almost committed,"" and ""I cant even kill myself."" This confirms explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language indicates a recent past event: ""I just attempted,"" ""I was right there about to do,"" and ""I almost committed"" all point to an action that occurred in the immediate past but was not ongoing at the time of posting.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is described: using a knife to cause bleeding in the wrists and thighs. The post details the action with the knife and the physical evidence (""bleeding already""), indicating a concrete plan and method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes an interrupted suicide attempt: the person initiated the action (causing bleeding with a knife) but stopped (""I put down my knife""). This is not a completed past attempt because the action was halted before completion. According to the framework, interrupted actions like this fall under BEHAVIOR.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""end my life,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - A specific plan/method (knife, cutting) and action initiation (bleeding) are described, but the attempt was interrupted.  
   - Per the classification rules, this fits BEHAVIOR: ""Interrupted attempts where action was initiated"" are explicitly categorized under BEHAVIOR. It does not qualify as ATTEMPT because ATTEMPT requires a completed past action (e.g., a full overdose or jump), regardless of outcome.  
   - Critical Classification Rule 3 reinforces that interrupted actions are BEHAVIOR, not ATTEMPT.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I feel like killing myself"" when interacting with parents, and ""I know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't."" These are direct expressions of suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The suicidal thoughts are described in present tense (""I feel like killing myself"") and framed as an ongoing reaction (""when I do [talk to them]""). No immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") or past attempt is indicated.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The user only references a general desire (""if I had the guts"") without concrete details.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Explicitly denies attempts: ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to."" No interrupted actions or self-harm descriptions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"").  
   - No plan/method/preparation is described.  
   - No past attempt occurred (user confirms this).  
   → Classification is **IDEATION** per rules: explicit death wishes without plans/methods.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""I feel like killing myself"" is explicitly suicidal, overriding INDICATOR.  
- Lack of methods/rules out BEHAVIOR.  
- Self-reported no attempts rules out ATTEMPT.  
- ""If I had the guts"" implies intent without action, aligning with IDEATION.

My fat ass of a guidance councillor was too busy eating chips to check her email and pull me out of the college level class early on. What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail?

I've already written my suicide note and put it on my notes app. I'm gonna just delete everything and just slit my wrists with some scissors when everyone is going to bed. So goodbye everyone. Kinda sad I never got to do anything. Not that I could've anyways.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape,"" and ""slit my wrists with some scissors."" It also references a ""suicide note."" These are clear expressions of suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Immediate timing is indicated with ""tonight"" and ""when everyone is going to bed,"" showing current and planned action. There are no past attempt descriptions (e.g., ""I tried""), only future-oriented statements.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is described: ""slit my wrists with some scissors.""  
   - Preparations are detailed: ""I've already written my suicide note and put it on my notes app"" and ""I'm gonna just delete everything.""  
   - No specific location is mentioned beyond the implied home setting, but the method and preparations are concrete.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No past suicide attempts or interrupted actions are described. The note writing is a preparation, not a past attempt. Self-harm isn't mentioned.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are present (e.g., ""ending my life""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific plan and preparations exist (method: wrist-slitting with scissors; preparation: written note), so it cannot be IDEATION.  
   - The actions described (e.g., writing the note) are preparations for a future event, not a completed past attempt, so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on explicit thoughts + plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit suicide content is confirmed (e.g., ""killing myself"").  
- No intrusive thoughts ambiguity; direct intent is expressed.  
- Preparations (note writing) are not interrupted actions or past attempts.  
- Past vs. present: Focus is on imminent plans, not historical actions.  
- When in doubt: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, method/preparation details confirm BEHAVIOR.

392,"""friend"" snitched on me and told family my plan to kill myself. now they're keeping their heads up and watching me. this is like preventing someone to get euthanized. what the fuck.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""my plan to kill myself,"" which directly references suicide and a desire to end life. This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide content, as it includes phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""plan to die"" (implied).

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post discusses a past event (""snitched on me and told family my plan"") and current prevention (""now they're keeping their heads up and watching me""). There is no immediate urgency indicated for the suicidal plan itself (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" for acting on the plan), but the reference to a ""plan"" suggests it was formulated prior to the disclosure.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The phrase ""my plan to kill myself"" explicitly indicates the existence of a suicide plan, even though specific methods or preparations are not detailed. According to the classification rules, ANY mention of a plan (without requiring specifics) qualifies for BEHAVIOR. The analogy to euthanasia (""preventing someone to get euthanized"") reinforces the intent but does not add new plan details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of a past suicide attempt, interrupted attempt, or self-harm action. The post only references the existence of a plan that was revealed, not any actions taken toward suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""plan to kill myself"").  
   - A plan is mentioned, so this cannot be IDEATION (which requires no plan/method).  
   - Since no past completed suicide attempt is described (only a plan, not an action), this is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicide thoughts and a plan mentioned, the classification is BEHAVIOR.  
   - Critical rule applied: Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if ANY plan is mentioned.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly states ""im gonna kill myself,"" which directly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to end life. Phrases like ""I hope my baby ends up safe"" also imply an expectation of death, reinforcing the suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post specifies a future timeline: ""3 weeks from now."" This indicates a planned timing for the suicidal act, not immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight"") or past events.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific plan is described: The person will ""minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks"" and then ""kill myself."" This behavioral preparation (isolating socially) constitutes a ""specific setup"" as defined in the framework, even though the method of suicide (e.g., pills, hanging) is not explicitly stated.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions. The content focuses solely on future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""im gonna kill myself""), and there is a specific plan/preparation (3-week timeline and social isolation). According to the framework, this meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR: ""explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations, or research.""  
   - Critical Rule #5 applies: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if any plan is mentioned. Here, the timeline and preparatory actions qualify.  
   - Not ATTEMPT, as no past completed action is described.  
   - Not INDICATOR, due to explicit suicide mentions.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions death with the phrase ""Would this kill me,"" which directly references the possibility of dying. This is in the context of listing substances (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, alcohol) that could be used for self-harm, indicating a focus on suicide or ending life. The wording ""kill me"" is an explicit expression of death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no specific time indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The post is framed as a question about potential lethality, which suggests consideration or preparation rather than immediate action. However, the detailed listing of substances implies current contemplation.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post describes specific methods and quantities: ""Midol 3 bottles,"" ""Prozac 30 20mg pills,"" ""Tylenol bottle,"" and ""Water bottle full of alcohol."" This constitutes a clear plan involving ingestion of multiple substances. Additionally, asking ""Would this kill me"" indicates research or seeking information about suicide methods, which falls under preparatory behavior.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past actions, attempts, or self-harm. The post is focused on a hypothetical or planned future action, not something that has already occurred.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death content is present (""Would this kill me""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - The post includes specific methods (substances and quantities) and research about lethality, so it goes beyond IDEATION.  
   - Since no past completed action is described (e.g., ""I took these""), it does not qualify as ATTEMPT.  
   - With explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific methods/preparations, the classification is BEHAVIOR according to the rules: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" The critical rule also states: ""Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned.""

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""preventing me from suicide"") and uses phrases like ""end it"" (a common euphemism for suicide) and ""doing it"" (referring to suicide). It also expresses a desire to die (""I'll get what I want""). This confirms explicit suicidal content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post uses present/future-oriented language like ""planning to end it,"" ""recently I've been thinking,"" and ""I'll get what I want,"" indicating current or ongoing suicidal thoughts, but no immediate time frame (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods are mentioned: ""doing it in a way that doesn't look like suicide. Like a car accident or something."" This shows consideration of a concrete method (staged accident) to achieve suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried"" or completed actions). The focus is on prevention due to loved ones and future planning, not past actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are present (suicide/death wishes), AND a specific method/plan is described (car accident). This fits the BEHAVIOR category. There is no indication of a past completed attempt, so ATTEMPT does not apply.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit suicide/death wishes are present, ruling out INDICATOR.  
- A method (car accident) is mentioned, elevating it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR (per rule: choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned).  
- No past completed actions, so not ATTEMPT.  
- Focus is on the writer's current plans, not others.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post expresses deep distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden (e.g., ""I'm a complete lost cause,"" ""I'm a constant burden,"" ""I'll never be able to help my mum""). However, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die. Phrases like ""I'm always going to fail"" or ""lost cause"" imply despair but do not directly reference ending life or suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language focuses on ongoing/general struggles (e.g., ""constantly stuck,"" ""never had any skills,"" ""always going to fail"") with no immediate or time-specific indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). Past events mentioned (e.g., failed jobs, driving lessons) relate to life failures, not suicide.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The ""attempts"" referenced are about fixing life situations (e.g., jobs, driving lessons), not suicide plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm. The phrase ""any attempts I've made"" refers to efforts to improve life, not self-harm or suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide/death wish mentioned, the classification falls under INDICATOR. The content involves severe distress and hopelessness but lacks any direct expression of suicidal intent, ideation, behavior, or attempt.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: The distress is implicit (e.g., ""lost cause"") but not explicit suicide/death language.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains expressions of severe distress, hopelessness, and feeling unable to continue (e.g., ""I am at the end of my rope,"" ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""I cant keep going like this"").
   - There is a reference to death: ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more."" However, this is not an explicit expression of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end life; it describes a lack of deterrence from death, but not a direct wish for death or suicide.
   - No phrases like ""I want to kill myself,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" or other explicit suicide/death wishes are present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - Current/immediate indicators: ""today"" (regarding writing a note), ""last night"" (regarding reaching out for help and hospital visit), ""lately"" (regarding worsening feelings).
   - Past events: Hospitalization described (""I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital""), but this is framed as a result of seeking help, not as a suicide attempt.
   - General/ongoing: Struggles described as lasting ""my whole life"" and ""for the last 20 some years.""

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - ""I wrote a note today"" could imply preparation (e.g., a suicide note), but the post does not specify the note's content or link it explicitly to suicide. Without explicit suicidal thoughts or context confirming it as a suicide note, this alone does not indicate a plan/method.
   - No mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, or research about suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - The hospitalization (""end up in the ER... transport to a different type of hospital"") is described as an outcome of reaching out for help, not as a suicide attempt. There is no description of actions like self-harm, interrupted attempts, or past suicide attempts (e.g., no statements like ""I tried to overdose"").
   - The event is in the past, but it lacks details confirming it was a suicide attempt; it appears to be a crisis response.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - No explicit suicide/death wishes are identified (e.g., no direct statements about wanting to die or commit suicide). Phrases like ""can't keep going"" and ""end of my rope"" convey hopelessness but are not explicit under the framework's definitions.
   - The mention of ""non existence after death"" refers to fear and lack of deterrence, not an active wish for death, so it does not qualify as explicit ideation.
   - ""I wrote a note today"" is ambiguous and could be a preparation, but without explicit suicidal thoughts, it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.
   - The hospitalization is not described as a past suicide attempt, so ATTEMPT does not apply.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language is in the past tense (""Tried,"" ""Didn't work""), indicating a description of past events rather than current or immediate plans. Words like ""again"" suggest a history of attempts but do not convey urgency about future actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method, plan, preparation, or location is mentioned (e.g., pills, jumping, or research). The post is vague about how the attempt was carried out, focusing only on the outcome.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes concrete past actions: ""Tried to end my life again"" and ""Didn't work."" This indicates a completed suicide attempt where the person took action with the intent to die, but it was unsuccessful. The phrase ""Tried didn't work"" reinforces that this was an actual attempt, not just a thought or plan.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (ending life), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - It describes a past completed action (attempt) with intent, regardless of outcome, so it meets the criteria for ATTEMPT.  
   - This is not IDEATION because it involves action, not just thoughts.  
   - This is not BEHAVIOR because BEHAVIOR covers plans, preparations, or interrupted actions, but here the action was completed (though unsuccessful).  
   - Critical rules: ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT."" Also, ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions.""

Final classification is ATTEMPT based on the description of a past suicide attempt.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post describes ongoing physical symptoms, medical consultations, and feelings of hopelessness (""I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me""). There are **no explicit mentions** of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to end life (e.g., no phrases like ""want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent).  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate or past timelines related to self-harm/suicide. The distress is framed as ongoing (""so far nothing has helped""), but not tied to active suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   **No references** to suicide methods, plans, preparations, or research. All actions described (e.g., medical treatments, CBD oil) relate to seeking symptom relief.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   **No mention** of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted suicide actions. The user describes medical interventions, not self-injurious behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - No explicit suicide/death wishes → **INDICATOR**  
   - Hopelessness and distress are present, but without suicidal expressions → **INDICATOR**  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- ""I feel hopeless"" and frustration with treatments fall under distress without explicit suicide intent.  
- No ambiguity requiring escalation to IDEATION (no death/suicide mentions).

I know I suck, everyone who cares to see it knows that I suck, I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes and suicide, such as ""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve to be dead,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" and ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot."" These phrases directly mention wanting to die or be killed, which qualifies as explicit suicide content under the framework (e.g., ""wanting to die,"" ""being dead,"" and specific violent methods).

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language is present-focused (e.g., ""I deserve,"" ""I wish,"" ""I'm tired""), indicating ongoing distress, but there are no immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" No past attempts or actions are described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods are mentioned: ""a fucking bullet in my head"" and ""slit my fucking throat."" These references to firearms and cutting/throat-slitting constitute specific suicide methods under the BEHAVIOR criteria. Although the post states ""I have no plans,"" the explicit mention of methods still triggers BEHAVIOR classification per the framework rules (any method mention, even without active planning, qualifies).

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm actions (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried to"" or descriptions of actions taken). The content focuses on current thoughts and wishes.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., wanting to die), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Specific methods are mentioned (bullet, throat-slitting), so it cannot be IDEATION (which requires no method).  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with specific methods qualifies as BEHAVIOR.  
   - Critical Rule 5 applies: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because any method is mentioned. The statement ""I have no plans"" does not override this, as the framework prioritizes method mention over lack of stated intent.

And who wants to be with a sad man? Noone. So that's my company, forever. Noone. I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I will die alone"" (future death reference), ""so am I"" (directly implies death after parents' passing), and ""I'm only alive by obligation"" (expresses life continuation solely due to external pressure).  
   - Context: ""the second they're gone, so am I"" explicitly links parental death to the user's intended death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Future-oriented: ""the second they're gone"" indicates conditional timing (after parents die), not immediate. No words like ""tonight"" or ""now.""  
   - No past attempts mentioned.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (pills, weapons), locations (bridges), preparations (notes), or research mentioned. Death intention is tied to a life event (parents' death) but lacks concrete logistical details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No descriptions of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. Focus is on emotional state and future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit death wishes (""so am I,"" ""I will die alone"") are present → **Rules out INDICATOR**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → **Rules out BEHAVIOR**.  
   - No past suicide actions described → **Rules out ATTEMPT**.  
   - Falls into IDEATION: Explicit desire to die tied to future conditions without actionable plans.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""I will die alone"" and ""so am I"" are explicit death wishes (Rule 1).  
- No ambiguity between categories: Explicit ideation without plans = IDEATION (Rule 5).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""suicidal ones"" (referring to urges), ""thinking about killing myself"", ""what it'd do to them"" (in context of suicide), ""I have a plan"".  
   - Death wishes: ""this might be our last conversation"", ""it could be my last"" (implying anticipation of death).  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current urgency: ""urges tonight"", ""happening again for a while now"" (ongoing), ""right now"" (immediate spiral).  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**

I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" in the context of the user lying about them to avoid therapy stress. This is a direct reference to suicide-related ideation. Metaphorical language like ""get out of this grave I dug myself"" implies distress but is not an explicit death wish; however, the explicit phrase ""suicidal thoughts"" triggers suicide content identification per the framework rules.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No current/immediate indicators (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"") are present. The user references ongoing issues (""more and more frequently"") but no specific timing for acting on thoughts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research about suicide are mentioned. The focus is on avoiding discussion of thoughts, not planning or acting on them.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""grave I dug myself"" is metaphorical and does not indicate a concrete past action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal thoughts""), but there is no mention of plans, methods, preparations, or actions. Per the framework, this falls under IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit mention of suicide thoughts overrides implicit distress (e.g., ""grave"" metaphor), so it is not INDICATOR.  
     - No plan/method, so not BEHAVIOR.  
     - No past attempt described, so not ATTEMPT.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""nearly killing myself"" and ""I fucking hate living"". ""nearly killing myself"" directly references suicide, and ""I fucking hate living"" is an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive, similar to ""don't want to survive"" or ""want to be gone"". This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - ""nearly killing myself"" refers to a past event (indicated by ""nearly"" and the context of being bullied), with no current/immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now"". ""I fucking hate living"" expresses ongoing distress but lacks urgency indicators.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - The phrase ""shooting up the school"" could imply a method, but it is part of the past context (""bullied me into nearly killing myself/shooting up the school"") and is not a current plan or preparation. There is no mention of specific methods, locations, preparations, or research related to current suicidal thoughts.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - ""nearly killing myself"" describes a past interrupted or aborted action (not completed). According to the rules, interrupted attempts are classified under BEHAVIOR only for current plans, but this is a past reference. There is no description of a completed past suicide attempt (e.g., no details of an actual action taken with intent to die).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I fucking hate living"" and ""nearly killing myself""), but there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for current suicidal ideation. The past event ""nearly killing myself"" is not a completed attempt (due to ""nearly""), so it does not qualify as ATTEMPT. Applying the critical rules:
     - Between INDICATOR and IDEATION: Choose IDEATION because of explicit death/suicide mentions (""I fucking hate living"").
     - Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR: No method/plan is mentioned for current thoughts, so not BEHAVIOR.
     - Between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT: No completed past action is described, so not ATTEMPT.
   - Therefore, the classification is IDEATION based on current explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan.

Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide-related content: ""Survived OD"" (OD meaning overdose), ""you can't kill yourself with ibuprofen"", ""I could've died"", and ""I wanted to [die]"". This confirms explicit expressions of death wishes and suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post describes a past event: ""When I sat there and swallowed 120+ pills..."" and ""I held off going to the hospital..."" indicate this happened in the past. There is no current/immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") for suicidal action, though ongoing thoughts are mentioned (""Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is described: taking 120+ ibuprofen pills combined with drinking hard liquor. This shows a concrete plan and preparation for suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post details a completed past suicide attempt: The person intentionally swallowed pills and alcohol to die, survived, and recounts the event as an overdose they ""wanted to"" happen. This is a completed action with intent, regardless of outcome.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (IDEATION level), but the post goes further by describing a specific method and a completed past action. According to the rules:  
     - ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT""  
     - Past attempts take precedence over current thoughts or plans (e.g., ""Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up"" is current ideation, but the attempt is the key event).  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - This is not an interrupted attempt (like putting a noose on but stopping); it was carried out and survived.  
     - Between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT, choose ATTEMPT for completed past actions.

**Conclusion:** The post describes a past completed suicide attempt with intent, method, and action, fitting the ATTEMPT category. Current thoughts are secondary and do not override the classification of the past event.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicide with the phrase: ""Suicide has become my quick solution."" This is a direct reference to suicide, fulfilling the criteria for explicit suicide/death content. Other phrases like ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all"" are implicit but not explicit on their own; however, the explicit mention of suicide overrides this.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   There are no immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The phrase ""has become"" suggests an ongoing or general state, not a specific timeline. No past events related to suicide actions are described.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The reference to suicide as a ""quick solution"" is vague and does not indicate a plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post discusses feelings and interactions but no concrete actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""Suicide has become my quick solution"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide confirms IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
- No method/plan means it cannot be BEHAVIOR.  
- No past attempt means it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
- The focus is solely on the author's current thoughts.

   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""want to die,"" or equivalent expressions appear.  
   - The phrase ""*keep on keeping on*"" references a video game mantra (Death Stranding) about perseverance, not death wishes.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I get suicidal thoughts,"" which directly references the person's own desire to die or end their life. This is an explicit expression of suicide, even though they add that they might not act on it.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The suicidal thoughts are described as ongoing (""I get suicidal thoughts"") with no immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""today."" The context is general distress (""felt like shit for years,"" ""reliving the same day everyday""), but the thoughts are current and persistent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), preparation, or research. The person explicitly states they are unlikely to act (""probably too much of a pussy to ever do it"").

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors by the person writing the post. References to the father's suicide are about someone else and do not count for classification.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I get suicidal thoughts""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described. According to the framework, this fits IDEATION. The person's doubt about acting does not change the classification, as explicit thoughts alone qualify as IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit mention of suicidal thoughts confirms IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
- No plan/method, so not BEHAVIOR.  
- No past actions by the person, so not ATTEMPT.  
- Focus is solely on the writer, not the father.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicide: ""i wanna off myself"" (a direct euphemism for suicide) and ""if i killed myself."" This qualifies as an explicit mention of wanting to die or end one's life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The language indicates a current desire (""i wanna off myself"") but shows ambivalence and fear (""i'm scared,"" ""i just wanna hang onto that string of hope""). There are no immediate time indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" and it reflects ongoing, general thoughts rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The references to suicide are vague and lack concrete details about how or when it might happen.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - The post describes depression, therapy, and life dissatisfaction, but there is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The focus is on thoughts and feelings, not actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""i wanna off myself""), but there is no evidence of a plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. Following the rules:
     - Explicit suicide thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION
   - Critical rules applied:
     - Explicit vs. Implicit: ""Off myself"" is explicit, even with ambivalence.
     - When in doubt: Between indicator and ideation, choose ideation due to explicit mention; between ideation and behavior, no method justifies ideation.

HI i'm a 15 year old girl and all my entire life i have been dreaming of becoming a high fashion model when i grow up but there's a problem only tall people can walk the ramp short people are not allowed. Ik that i can be a commercial model if i want to because there is no height requirements but i really2 want to be a high fashion one because that's what i've always wanted ,my whole entire life. If i don't choose the carreer that i want i know that i will never be happy with my life. I haven't grow since last year and to make it worse im only 4'11 feet and the height requirements for runway models are 5'7 to 5'8 or 9. I feel so hopeless with myself that's why i want to give up my life and just die. And that's not the only reason, all my friends are getting taller then me and i am losing my self esteem very fast. I REALLY WANT TO DIE but i can't leave my parents too,im their only child and if they lose me i don't even want to know what will happen to them. I FEEL TRAPED. THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR ME. IF I LIVE I KNOW I WLL NEVER BE HAPPY WITH MYSELF AND IF I DIE I KNOW MY PARENTS WOULD BE DEVASTATED. I hate myself, i really hate myself. i'm so hopeless and such an idiot, why did i want to choose such a career where i know there is no future for me. As i'm writing this my mind is becoming more worse and the suicidal thoughts are like eating me up. There is no one that i can share my problems with.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, including: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""i want to give up my life and just die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE,"" and ""the suicidal thoughts are like eating me up."" These phrases clearly indicate a desire to die or end one's life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The suicidal thoughts are described in the present tense (e.g., ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE,"" ""as I'm writing this""), indicating current and ongoing distress. However, there are no specific indicators of immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") or past suicide-related events.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide plans, methods, preparations, or locations are mentioned. The post expresses a general desire to die but lacks details like pills, jumping, or any other concrete means.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The focus is on thoughts and feelings, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present, so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicidal thoughts but no plan or method, the classification is IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit phrases like ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"" qualify as suicide content, even with ambivalence (e.g., not acting due to parents).  
- No method or plan shifts it away from BEHAVIOR.  
- No past attempt rules out ATTEMPT.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, IDEATION is chosen due to the absence of method details.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""I've been contemplating suicide,"" ""I didn't want to live,"" ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together,"" and ""I'm ending it."" These phrases clearly express a desire to die or commit suicide, so suicide content is present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The suicidal thoughts are described as ongoing (""for the past month I've been contemplating suicide"") but not immediate. The plan to act is conditional (""if she should want to kill her self,"" ""if she gone""), with no specific timing like ""now"" or ""tonight."" This suggests low urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - There is a specific plan described: the agreement to commit suicide together with the girl if she decides to do so (""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together""). Additionally, the user states a personal plan to act if the girl is gone (""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it""). While no specific method (e.g., pills, cutting) is detailed for the user's own actions, the agreement and declaration of intent constitute a plan under the BEHAVIOR category, which includes ""describing preparations.""

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - The user describes a history of self-harm (""cutting my self"") but clarifies it is for emotional regulation (""to subvert the pain to a physical one""), not as a suicide attempt. There is no mention of past suicide attempts by the user. The girl's failed attempt is noted, but this pertains to her, not the user.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., contemplating suicide, not wanting to live), so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - A plan is mentioned (the suicide pact and conditional intent to act), so it meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR",indicator,True

I'm a dependent person. I need her and she needs to be alone. So that means I need to die because it's better than living in pain. I don't know what to do.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""Why is it frowned upon to kill yourself?"" and ""I need to die because it's better than living in pain.""  
   - Direct mentions of suicide (""kill yourself"") and death wishes (""need to die"") are present.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). Describes ongoing pain (""living in pain"") but lacks urgency.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - References trying to ""move on"" (emotional effort), not past suicide attempts or self-harm.

   - No plan/method/preparation described → **IDEATION** (not BEHAVIOR).  
   - No past suicide attempt described → **Not ATTEMPT**.  
   - *Critical Rule Application*: Explicit death wishes without plans = IDEATION. ""Why is it frowned upon to kill yourself?"" is a rhetorical question about suicide but lacks method details.

   - ""take a gun and kill yourself""  
   - ""shoot yourself already""  
   - ""Did you try to kill yourself again?""  
   - ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?""  
   - References to self-harm (""cut your wrists again"").  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Past attempts are explicitly referenced: ""Did you **try** to kill yourself **again**?"" and similar phrases indicate recurring historical actions.  
   - No immediate/imminent timing words (e.g., ""tonight"") for current plans.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods are mentioned (gun, cutting wrists), but these are referenced by parents in the context of the author’s **past actions**, not current plans.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   **Critical evidence**: The parents repeatedly reference the author’s **past suicide attempts** (e.g., ""try to kill yourself again"") and self-harm (""cut your wrists again""). The dad’s statement ""You are too coward to actually do it"" confirms past attempts occurred.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content is present (IDEATION/BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT threshold met).  
   - **Past completed actions are described** (attempts to kill oneself, self-harm), fitting the ATTEMPT category.  
   - No current plans/preparations are stated by the author, but historical actions dominate the narrative.  

**Classification Rules Application:**  
- ""Try to kill yourself again"" qualifies as a **completed past action** (ATTEMPT).  
- Parental quotes describe the author’s actions, not hypotheticals.  
- Rule 4: Focus on past actions (ATTEMPT) over current ideation.

415,What's the least painful way to kill yourself?. I know I shouldn't be asking this but I just need a way to Kim's. I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit someone just give me a straight up answer.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and includes phrases like ""least painful way to kill yourself"" and ""a way to Kim's"" (which appears to be a typo for ""kill myself"" given the context). This directly expresses a desire to die or commit suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language indicates current intent, such as ""I just need"" and the demand for a ""straight up answer,"" but no specific time frame (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned. The focus is on immediate inquiry.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The user is actively seeking information about suicide methods by asking for the ""least painful way"" and insisting on a direct answer. This constitutes research into methods, which aligns with the BEHAVIOR category (specifically, ""seeking information about suicide methods"").

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions are described. The content is solely about current thoughts and inquiries.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill yourself""), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation beyond seeking information, so it is not fully IDEATION.  
   - The act of seeking method information qualifies as BEHAVIOR under the framework (""seeking information about suicide methods"").  
   - No past suicide attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit suicide content is present.  
- Seeking method information pushes this to BEHAVIOR (as per ""plan/method"" inclusion).  
- No doubt between categories: BEHAVIOR is clear due to method-focused inquiry.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""write a suicidal note"" explicitly references suicide preparation. ""Suicidal note"" directly indicates thoughts about ending one's life.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   ""Again"" implies recurrence but lacks immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight""). The focus is on current distress (""stomach convulsing""), not past actions.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Writing a suicide note is a specific preparation step, falling under ""describing preparations"" in the BEHAVIOR category.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   ""Again"" suggests past similar behavior but doesn't describe a completed suicide attempt (e.g., no overdose/cutting).  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (note) → Not INDICATOR  
   - Specific preparation (writing note) → BEHAVIOR  
   - No description of completed past action → Not ATTEMPT

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""slaying myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide, equivalent to ""killing myself"" or ""ending life."" This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content, as it directly expresses a desire for self-inflicted death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The use of ""I will"" and ""end up"" suggests future intent but lacks immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The word ""maybe"" introduces uncertainty, but the thought is still present.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, locations). ""Slaying myself"" is vague and does not describe a plan. The phrase ""committing a massacre"" relates to harming others, not the poster's suicide risk, so it is irrelevant per the rules.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on potential future actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""slaying myself"").  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.  
   - Therefore, based on the logic: explicit thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Rules clarification: Even with uncertainty (""maybe""), explicit suicide mention triggers IDEATION. No evidence for BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" in the phrase: ""my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" This is a direct reference to thoughts of suicide, even though the person follows it with ""I don't want to die— I want to live."" According to the rules, any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or ideation counts, regardless of stated intent not to act.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate urgency indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") are present. The ideation is described in a general/ongoing context (""stems from shame""), with no specific timing linked to suicide.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide plans, methods, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on personal struggles (laziness, daydreaming, academic issues) but does not reference any actionable steps or details related to suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The ""suicidal ideation"" is framed as a thought process, not an action taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""suicidal ideation"") are present, but no plan, method, or preparation is indicated. There is also no mention of past attempts. Following the decision logic:  
     - Explicit suicide thoughts without a plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules reinforce this:  
     - Intrusive thoughts (e.g., ""my suicidal ideation"") still qualify as IDEATION even if the person denies intent.  
     - No evidence for BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT categories.  
     - When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION due to explicit mention.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide: ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head."" This includes a direct expression of wanting to die by suicide, with phrases like ""shoot myself"" and concerns about death/disability. Even though the person expresses hesitation, the explicit mention of suicide/death is present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language indicates a current desire (""I wanna"") but not immediate urgency (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). The focus is on hypothetical outcomes and hesitation, suggesting ongoing thoughts rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is detailed: ""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head."" This includes acquiring a means (the handgun) and a concrete plan (shooting). Preparations like obtaining the weapon are described, falling under BEHAVIOR criteria.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The post discusses potential future actions and fears, not completed or initiated behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present, AND a specific plan/method (handgun) is described. According to the framework, this qualifies as BEHAVIOR. The hesitation does not negate the presence of a plan; BEHAVIOR includes expressing preparations even if not acted upon. This is not IDEATION because a method is specified, and not ATTEMPT because no past action occurred.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit suicide content is clear, and a method/preparation is mentioned, so BEHAVIOR is appropriate.  
- The classification focuses on the author's expressed thoughts and plans, not their hesitation or refusal to seek help.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, the presence of a method dictates BEHAVIOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains phrases expressing hopelessness and dissatisfaction, such as ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" and ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving."" However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""want to die,"" or equivalent phrases like ""want to be gone""). The expressions used are about the quality of life being poor but do not explicitly state a desire for death or self-harm.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The post describes ongoing distress since March 2020, with no immediate or time-specific indicators related to suicide (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The focus is on enduring the situation (""I just try to get through the day"") rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or research (e.g., pills, locations, or acquiring means). The content is centered on health struggles and life circumstances.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No references to past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The user discusses life events like leaving university and moving home, but no actions related to suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, the classification falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction, but lacks any explicit suicidal content required for IDEATION, BEHAVIOR, or ATTEMPT.

**Critical Rules Application:**
- ""Life isn't worth living"" is implicit distress, not an explicit death wish, so it does not trigger IDEATION.
- No doubt between categories: No explicit suicide content means INDICATOR is appropriate.
- Focus is solely on the user's own experiences.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon"" and ""I think I'll be gone"" (which implies being dead or not wanting to be alive). This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post references future timing (""soon,"" ""by February"") but no immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). It also includes planning around timing (""I don't want to do it on Christmas... I'll wait a bit""), indicating contemplation rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location (e.g., bridge) is mentioned. The discussion of timing (""by February"") relates to when the act might occur but does not describe how, preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or research into methods. This lacks the specificity required for a plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried""), interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The focus is on future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself,"" ""be gone""), but no specific plan, method, or preparation is described. According to the framework, this falls under IDEATION: ""explicit expressions of wanting to die... but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""  
   - Critical Rules:  
     - Explicit mention confirms IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
     - No method or detailed plan (only timing) means it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
     - No past action, so not ATTEMPT.  
     - When in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR only if any method/plan is mentioned; here, timing alone is insufficient for BEHAVIOR.

422,"I just want to die its that plain and simple. Too many problems, im a fucked up person, gonna end my life this month.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I just want to die"" and ""gonna end my life this month,"" which are direct expressions of wanting to die and suicidal intent. This satisfies the criteria for suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""gonna end my life this month"" indicates a future timeframe (""this month"") but lacks immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post expresses intent (""gonna end my life"") but does not specify any method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparations, or research. It is a general statement without concrete details.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content focuses on current thoughts and future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to die,"" ""end my life""), ruling out INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is described, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post falls under IDEATION, as it expresses suicidal thoughts without specifics on plans or methods.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Rule 1: ""I want to die"" and ""end my life"" are explicit.  
- Rule 2: Intrusive thoughts or general expressions count as IDEATION.  
- Rule 5: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, since no method is mentioned, IDEATION is chosen.

If you are mental ill or suicidal and still want kids go for it I won't judge, you may be a good parent",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" (""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughs""). This directly references suicide/death wishes, satisfying the criterion for explicit mention. Phrases like ""I'm suffering"" or ""pessimistic"" indicate distress but are not standalone suicide references; however, the explicit ""suicidal thoughts"" triggers this step.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No current/immediate indicators (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"") are present. The reference to suicidal thoughts is general/ongoing (e.g., ""helped me to understood""), with no specific timing or urgency implied.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research about suicide are mentioned. The post discusses suicidal thoughts abstractly in the context of mental illness and realism, without details on how, where, or when.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post refers only to thoughts (""suicidal thoughts"") and does not describe any actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""suicidal thoughts"") are present, but no plan/method/preparation is indicated. According to the rules, this falls under IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit mention of suicide (""suicidal thoughts"") overrides implicit distress, confirming IDEATION over INDICATOR.  
     - No plan/method means it is not BEHAVIOR.  
     - No past attempt described, so not ATTEMPT.

424,"As much as I hate it, suicide genuinely seems like the only solution. I feel like I've tried everything at this point. It just feels like nothings gonna work. And it's getting to the point where I consider checking myself into a hospital multiple times a day. Honestly, maybe I wasn't cut out for life. That's what it feels like at least. I'm done being this sad fucked up person. If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out. It feels like only viable solution",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"") and ""kill myself"" (""If I kill myself""). Phrases like ""I'm done being this sad fucked up person"" and ""only viable solution"" further reinforce explicit expressions of death wishes in the context of distress.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post references a future timeframe (""it'll be on my birthday"") with ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out,"" indicating non-immediate intent. There are no indicators of current/immediate action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). Mentions of ""consider checking myself into a hospital multiple times a day"" reflect ongoing distress but not suicide urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post includes planning elements: ""it'll be on my birthday"" specifies a timing, and ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out"" explicitly describes preparation. However, no specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or locations (e.g., bridges) are mentioned.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. Phrases like ""I've tried everything"" refer to general problem-solving, not suicide-related actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (suicide and killing self mentioned).  
   - Planning is mentioned (""plan it out"" and specific timing ""on my birthday""), which constitutes preparation under the BEHAVIOR category.  
   - Since there is no description of a completed past action, ATTEMPT does not apply.  
   - Applying the critical rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if ANY plan/method is mentioned. Here, the explicit reference to planning moves this to BEHAVIOR.

Now I'm just fighting this battle alone. So what is the point anymore I've failed",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The phrase ""I've been thinking of ending it all"" explicitly refers to suicide. ""Ending it all"" is a direct euphemism for suicide/death wishes.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Uses ""now"" (""now I've been thinking"") indicating current thoughts, but no immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No mention of specific methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thought (""ending it all"") is present → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Rules out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of a past completed suicide action → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   → Falls under IDEATION (explicit wish to die without specifics).  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""Ending it all"" is explicit suicide content per framework.  
- No method/plan → IDEATION, not BEHAVIOR.  
- Intrusive thoughts rule: Even passive expression (""thinking of"") counts as IDEATION.

426,"I want to do this once and for all. I want to get it over with. I'll most likely attempt this weekend.

I feel kind of sorry for my mom though, her dad died a few days ago and now my death will be following very soon too. I hope she learns to cope well",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions death and suicide-related intentions. Key phrases include:  
   - ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" – ""attempt"" strongly implies a suicide attempt in this context.  
   - ""my death will be following very soon too"" – direct reference to the user's impending death.  
   These indicate explicit expressions of wanting to die or end life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post includes specific timing:  
   - ""this weekend"" – indicates a near-future plan.  
   - ""very soon"" – reinforces urgency.  
   This suggests imminent risk, though not immediate (e.g., not ""today"" or ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The user describes concrete preparations:  
   - ""get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents"" – this is a specific action to arrange affairs before death, which qualifies as preparation under BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   No explicit method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned, but the will preparation is sufficient for BEHAVIOR.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. The post focuses on future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death content is present (from Step 1), ruling out INDICATOR.  
   - Preparation (will) is mentioned, so this is not IDEATION (which requires no plan/method).  
   - The post describes future plans/preparations, not a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on explicit thoughts AND preparation, classify as BEHAVIOR.  
   - Critical rule applied: Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if ANY plan/method/preparation is mentioned.

427,"I don't want to. The final test that will decide whether or not I'll live till October is coming up.

I don't know how much I'll have to wait before i finally get some antidepressants but I'm feeling better nonetheless and i don't even know how I'll do it",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains explicit mentions of death and suicide-related concepts:
     - ""I'll live till October"" implies a conditional survival tied to the test outcome.
     - ""i really cannot live if i fail"" directly expresses that failure could lead to death.
     - References to methods: ""no access to my meds"" (suggests overdose as a potential method), ""no place to jump from"" (specific method: jumping), and ""the blades i used to cut"" (specific method: cutting, with discussion of lethality).
   - Even though the person states ""I don't want to die"" and describes current positive feelings, the explicit mentions of death, suicide, and methods qualify as suicidal content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The test is framed as a decisive future event (""will decide whether or not I'll live till October""), indicating that suicidal thoughts are conditional on failing, but tied to a specific timeline (October).
   - No immediate urgency words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" for current plans; the person is focused on the future test and current barriers (e.g., ""no access to my meds"").
   - Past events are mentioned (""blades I used to cut""), but this is historical self-harm, not a current action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - Specific suicide methods are explicitly referenced: jumping (from a height), cutting with blades, and medication overdose (implied by ""no access to my meds"").
   - The person assesses the feasibility of these methods (e.g., ""no place to jump from,"" ""blades... won't go that deep""), indicating detailed consideration of how to carry out suicide.
   - No current preparations (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes) are described, but the identification of methods and barriers shows active planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - Past self-harm is mentioned (""blades I used to cut""), but this is described as non-lethal (""won't go that deep"") and not framed as a suicide attempt. There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt (e.g., no mention of actions taken with intent to die).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""i really cannot live if i fail"" and implied conditional death wish tied to the test).
   - Specific methods are mentioned (jumping, cutting, medication overdose), which elevates it beyond general ideation.
   - No interrupted or completed suicide attempt is described in the past; the cutting is self-harm, not an attempt.
   - Classification rules:
     - Explicit death/suicide mentions and methods → BEHAVIOR (per rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR"").
     - ""When in doubt"" rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because methods are specified.

**Final Classification:** BEHAVIOR (due to explicit suicidal thoughts with specific methods, despite current positive feelings and lack of immediate means).

And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time. I believe we're stuck in a system and forced to be milked out of work labor until we're exhausted and thrown out. This neverending process only helps the things I hate the most, and I don't know what to do anymore with my life.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post expresses feelings of hopelessness, exhaustion, and lack of purpose (e.g., ""drained me the fuck out of all my motivation,"" ""taken my will to strive,"" ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"").  
   - However, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (e.g., no phrases like ""want to kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""be dead"").  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language describes ongoing distress (e.g., ""neverending process,"" ""I feel,"" ""I believe"") but no immediate or urgent terms related to suicide (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""going to"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide/death content, the classification defaults to INDICATOR, as the post focuses on distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction without any suicidal expressions.  
   - Applying critical rules:  
     - Explicit vs. Implicit: The hopelessness is implicit (e.g., ""don't know what to do"") but not explicit suicide.  
     - When in Doubt: No suicide mention, so not IDEATION; no plan or attempt, so not BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.

Im sorry everyone. Im not strong enough.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes. Examples include: ""kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out,"" ""shoot myself with a gun,"" ""Its a net gain for the world if i die,"" ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die,"" and ""I'm just waiting for the end."" These phrases directly reference suicide or a desire to die, satisfying the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timing is future-oriented and conditional, not immediate. Phrases like ""Once I get a place"" and ""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"" indicate planning for a later time. There is no use of words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" for immediacy, and no mention of past attempts (e.g., no ""I tried"" statements). The urgency is moderate but not current.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific suicide methods are detailed: ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"" and ""shoot myself with a gun."" Additionally, the post references planning elements, such as isolation (""die alone and cold,"" ""if im far enough away,"" ""my body probably wouldn't be found"") and concealment of death. The phrase ""start cutting myself"" is included, but it is presented as part of suicidal options (to ""ease my pain"" in the context of suicidal distress). No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means) or research are mentioned, but the specific methods qualify as a plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no statements like ""I tried to overdose"" or ""I put a belt around my neck""). The references to actions like cutting or killing oneself are future-oriented (""I'll... do what I want to do"") or hypothetical, not completed past events.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from Step 1), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Specific plans/methods are described (from Step 3), so it cannot be IDEATION.  
   - No past completed actions are mentioned (from Step 4), so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR: explicit suicidal thoughts with specific methods (slitting wrists, shooting with a gun) and implicit planning around location/concealment.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Rule 1: Phrases like ""kill myself"" are explicit.  
     - Rule 3: No interrupted actions described.  
     - Rule 4: Focus on present/future plans, not past.  
     - Rule 5: Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to method mentions; between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT, choose BEHAVIOR as no past attempt occurred.

     - ""I just want someone to love me"" reflects loneliness, not suicidal intent.  
     - No ambiguity – absence of suicide keywords confirms INDICATOR.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicide with phrases like ""i shouldn't kill myself"" and ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"" (where ""this"" refers to killing oneself). It also includes expressions of not wanting to be alive, such as ""i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living."" This confirms explicit suicide/death content, ruling out INDICATOR.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post indicates current urgency with phrases like ""the day i chose is very soon"" and ""today i had the urge."" This suggests imminent timing, but it does not specify an exact timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The phrase ""for over a decade"" references an ongoing desire, but the focus is on present intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations (e.g., bridges), or concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). The discussion about calling grandparents or saying goodbye to loved ones could imply emotional preparation, but it is not a direct description of suicide planning or method research. The user explicitly states disinterest in intervention (""i'm not interested in being talked down""), but this does not constitute a plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes a long-standing desire (""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"") but no actual past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. References to potential outcomes (""i might end up in hell"") are speculative, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kill myself""), so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is described (e.g., no details on how, where, or tools), so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past suicide attempts are described, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION, as it expresses a desire to die without actionable plans.  
   - Critical rules applied: Explicit mentions like ""kill myself"" trigger IDEATION even with urgency (""very soon""), and intrusive thoughts are covered under IDEATION. No escalation to BEHAVIOR without method/plan details.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" and ""I Just want to be out of my misery."" These phrases directly reference suicidal thoughts and a desire to escape pain through death, which qualifies as explicit suicide/death wishes.

   - The language indicates current feelings (""most suicidal I've been,"" ""I Just want""), but there are no specific/immediate timeframes like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It references a general increase in suicidal thoughts over recent months.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or research. ""Not going to contact anyone"" suggests isolation but does not describe a concrete suicide plan or method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" implies past ideation but no actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from Step 1), but no plan/method/preparation is identified (from Step 3). According to the classification rules, this fits IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- Explicit suicide content is confirmed; ""suicidal"" and ""want to be out of my misery"" are explicit in context.  
- No ambiguity with higher categories: No plan/method for BEHAVIOR, and no past action for ATTEMPT.  
- Risk applies only to the author.  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen due to explicit mention.

434,I just want to die. Why is it so hard to die. I just want to kill myself but I can't find a suitable way to go,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I just want to die"" and ""I just want to kill myself"" directly express death/suicide wishes.  
   - Additional context: ""Why is it so hard to die"" reinforces desire for death.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Present-tense language (""want to die,"" ""want to kill myself"") indicates current ideation. No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") noted.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - States they ""can't find a suitable way to go,"" explicitly indicating active research/consideration of suicide methods.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (IDEATION threshold met).  
   - Method-seeking (""can't find a suitable way"") qualifies as plan-related behavior → BEHAVIOR.  
   - Rules clarification: Seeking methods explicitly triggers BEHAVIOR classification per framework.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
   - ""When in doubt"" rule: IDEATION vs. BEHAVIOR → BEHAVIOR due to method mention.  
   - ""Intrusive thoughts"" rule: Explicit suicide wishes override ambivalence.

Im worried that how i can devolp a second language by moving there?. Is it worth guys,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains expressions of distress, such as ""in the low point,"" ""zero social skills/low self esteem/lonely,"" and seeking help/advice. However, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, wanting to die, or any related phrases (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" ""want to be dead""). The user discusses life challenges and a potential move to another country but does not reference suicide or death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - No indicators of immediacy (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or past suicide-related events. The user expresses ongoing general concerns (e.g., ""worried"" about language development) but nothing tied to suicidal timing.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No mention of suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research. The post focuses on life decisions (moving countries) without any suicidal context.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is about emotional struggles, not actions taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide/death content, the classification falls under INDICATOR per the rules. The post expresses distress, hopelessness (low self-esteem, loneliness), and life dissatisfaction without crossing into explicit suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt.

**Critical Rules Applied:**
- Explicit vs. Implicit: Distress is implicit (e.g., ""low point,"" ""lonely"") but lacks explicit suicide/death language.
- When in Doubt: No explicit suicide mention, so not IDEATION; INDICATOR is appropriate.
- The risk is solely about the author, and no other people are mentioned.

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post says, ""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,"" which is a death wish directed at another person (the one who reported the post). There is no mention of the poster wanting to die, commit suicide, end their own life, or any similar self-referential phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" or ""I don't want to be alive."" The content focuses on anger and a wish for harm to someone else, not the poster themselves.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""ASAP"" (as soon as possible) indicates urgency, but it applies to the wish for the other person's death, not the poster's own suicidal thoughts or actions. There are no indicators of current, past, or ongoing suicidal intent for the poster.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of any suicide plan, method, preparation, or research by the poster. The post is solely about expressing anger toward another individual.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description or implication of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors by the poster.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - No explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned for the poster (only for someone else), so this does not meet the threshold for IDEATION, BEHAVIOR, or ATTEMPT.  
   - The post expresses distress (anger and frustration over the account ban) but without any explicit suicidal content for the poster.  
   - According to the rules, the classification must focus on the person writing the post, not others.  
   - Therefore, based on the absence of self-referential suicide content, this falls under INDICATOR.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Rule: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned.""  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR and IDEATION: Since there is no explicit suicide mention for the poster, choose INDICATOR.

I tried every possible thing to make her stop, but she is the most jealous person I have ever met in my life, so I will kill her, to finally live my life in peace. Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post mentions ""suicide"" in a general context (""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others""), but this is not a personal expression of wanting to die or kill oneself. The focus is on killing someone else (the bully), with statements like ""I will kill her"" and ""how to murder her."" There is no explicit mention of the poster wanting to end their own life, commit suicide, or express death wishes for themselves. Phrases like ""to finally live my life in peace"" indicate a desire to live after the act, not self-harm.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - Urgency is directed toward harming the bully (""I will kill her""), but there are no indicators of immediate or ongoing suicidal intent for the poster. Timing references like ""I tried every possible thing"" relate to past efforts to stop bullying, not self-harm.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses plans and methods for murder (""how to murder her""), but this is homicidal, not suicidal. There is no mention of suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research related to self-harm.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - The poster references past actions (""I tried every possible thing to make her stop""), but these are about addressing bullying, not suicide attempts or self-harm. No history of suicidal behavior is described.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die in relation to the poster themselves, this falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses distress (bullying, jealousy) and a desire to harm others, but without any suicidal content for the writer.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**
- **Explicit vs. Implicit:** No explicit suicidal expressions for the poster; all harmful intent is directed outward.
- **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION only if suicide is explicitly mentioned—which it is not. Thus, INDICATOR is appropriate.
- **Important Rules:** Classification is solely for the poster's suicide risk; homicidal content does not factor into suicide categories.

438,I'm on the verge of suicide. 19F I seriously cannot do this anymore. My mental health really bad and the stress of college is making. Honestly the stress might kill me before I even kill myself. I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes:  
   - ""I'm on the verge of suicide"" directly states suicide.  
   - ""before I even kill myself"" explicitly references killing oneself.  
   - ""I just want to end it all"" is a clear expression of wanting to die.  
   This meets the threshold for explicit suicide content, ruling out INDICATOR.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""I'm on the verge of suicide"" implies current/immediate intent (e.g., ""verge"" suggests imminent action).  
   - ""I seriously cannot do this anymore"" and ""I just want to end it all"" indicate present distress and desire.  
   No past attempts or events are described, so the focus is on current/ongoing risk.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The statement ""I know exactly what to do"" explicitly indicates a specific plan or method for suicide, even though the method itself isn't detailed. This implies preparation or knowledge of how to act, which aligns with BEHAVIOR criteria (plan/preparation mentioned).

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There are no references to past suicide attempts (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or descriptions of actions taken). Self-harm or interrupted attempts are not mentioned.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (suicide, killing self, ending life).  
   - A plan/method is indicated by ""I know exactly what to do,"" moving this beyond IDEATION.  
   - No past attempt is described, so ATTEMPT is ruled out.  
   - Applying the rules: Explicit thoughts + plan/method → BEHAVIOR.  
   - When in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: The presence of ANY plan/method (here, implied by ""know exactly what to do"") means BEHAVIOR is chosen.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit phrases expressing a desire for death: ""Someone kill me dude"" and ""I just wanna die."" These directly reference wanting to die or be killed, which qualifies as explicit suicide/death content under the framework (e.g., ""wanting to die"" or ""kill me"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - There are no immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" nor references to past events. The language (""wanna die"") suggests a general or ongoing state, not urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The phrase ""Someone kill me"" is vague and does not indicate a concrete plan or method by the person themselves.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current wishes, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""wanna die,"" ""kill me""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on explicit expressions of wanting to die without specifics, it falls under IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- The phrases are explicit death wishes, satisfying IDEATION requirements.  
- ""Someone kill me"" is interpreted as the person's own death wish, not involving others per the rules.  
- No doubt between categories: Explicit mention rules out INDICATOR; lack of method rules out BEHAVIOR; no past action rules out ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post expresses deep distress, including feelings of being ""tired of being unhappy,"" ""lost and alone,"" ""depressed,"" and ""always rejected."" However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, wanting to die, or phrases like ""killing self,"" ""ending life,"" or ""want to be gone."" The closest phrases are ""take all thoughts away from my mind"" and ""take all... depression everything negative out my life,"" which indicate a desire for relief from suffering but not a wish to die. Thus, no suicide content is identified.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post uses words like ""tired"" and ""always"" (e.g., ""always had unhappy life,"" ""tired of being depressed"") to describe ongoing distress, but there are no immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to."" It references past events (e.g., ""molested at 5 years"") but no past or current suicide-related actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., writing notes), or research about suicide. The focus is on pleading for divine intervention to change circumstances, not on planning self-harm.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post describes past life events (e.g., molestation, upbringing) but no history of suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. Statements like ""always had unhappy life"" refer to general suffering, not concrete actions toward suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit suicide/death wish mentioned (Step 1), the classification defaults to INDICATOR. The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, depression, and dissatisfaction with life, which aligns with the INDICATOR category definition: distress without explicit suicidal content.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- No explicit suicide references, so no basis for IDEATION, BEHAVIOR, or ATTEMPT.  
- When in doubt between INDICATOR and IDEATION, the absence of explicit death/suicide mentions confirms INDICATOR.  
- Focus is solely on the author; no other people are mentioned.

441,"Anyone suicidal from knee pain?. Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post asks, ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" which references suicide indirectly but does not include any explicit personal expression of wanting to die, kill oneself, or end one's life by the author. The author describes frustration and hopelessness about chronic knee pain but never states they personally feel suicidal or wish to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post mentions ""It's been 8 months, with no change in sight,"" indicating ongoing distress without any immediate or urgent timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). This suggests a general, persistent issue rather than imminent risk.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or research. The content focuses solely on the physical pain and lack of improvement, with no reference to means or locations for self-harm.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post does not describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. It only discusses the knee injury and its duration.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - There is no explicit suicide/death wish expressed by the author (e.g., ""I want to die"" or ""I am suicidal""). The reference to suicide is general and rhetorical.  
   - Therefore, based on the rules:  
     - No explicit suicide mention → INDICATOR category.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": The phrase ""Anyone suicidal"" is not an explicit personal statement; it's a question about others.  
     - ""When in doubt"": Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, choose IDEATION only if there is an explicit mention—which is absent here.  
     - The suicide risk is only for the person writing, and the author does not claim personal suicidal feelings.

I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions related to death and dying, such as ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"" and ""one last record for me to make and its finally over."" These phrases indicate a clear desire for death, aligning with the framework's examples like ""want to be gone"" or ""give in to death."" Even though the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the context of distress makes this an explicit death wish.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - There are no immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight,"" ""today,"" or ""now."" Phrases such as ""I don't think I can go on much longer"" and ""one last record... and its finally over"" suggest a general or future-oriented timeline without specificity. The phrase ""looking forward to"" implies anticipation but not imminence.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or locations (e.g., bridges) are mentioned. The reference to ""one last record"" could imply a preparatory step, but it is vague and not clearly a suicide-specific preparation like acquiring means or writing a note. Substance abuse is discussed as a coping mechanism (""rooted in the need to be loved""), not as a method for suicide. No research or seeking of methods is present.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts by the author (e.g., ""I tried to"" or descriptions of actions). The reference to someone else's suicide (""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life"") does not pertain to the author's own actions. Substance abuse is noted but is not framed as a suicidal behavior in this context.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit death wishes are present (e.g., ""give in to the nothingness that is death""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations described, ruling out BEHAVIOR.
   - No past suicide attempts are described, ruling out ATTEMPT.
   - Therefore, the post fits IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die or embrace death without specific plans or methods.

**Critical Rules Application:**
- The suicide risk focuses solely on the author, not others mentioned.
- Explicit death wishes are present, so IDEATION is chosen over INDICATOR.
- No method/plan is specified, so IDEATION is chosen over BEHAVIOR.
- No past attempt is described, so ATTEMPT does not apply.
- When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, BEHAVIOR would only apply with any method/plan, which is absent here.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states ""I want to die,"" which is a direct expression of a death wish. This meets the criteria for suicide-related content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The desire is expressed in the present tense (""I want to die""), but there are no specific indicators of immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is, it'll be worth it"" suggests a general intent rather than an immediate plan.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping) or location (e.g., a bridge). The vague reference to ""wherever it is"" does not constitute a concrete plan, preparation, or research into methods.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors is present.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""I want to die"") are present, so this is not INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is described (the vagueness of ""wherever it is"" does not qualify as a plan), so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on explicit thoughts without a plan, this falls under IDEATION.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Explicit mentions include: ""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck,"" ""suicidale all my life,"" ""tried to cut my wrists,"" ""laid on a road... hoping a car would run me over,"" ""jumped in front of a train,"" and ""I just can't pull myself togehter and just do it.""  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - Past events dominate: References to attempts at ages 4, 11, 19, and 24.  
   - Current context: ""Today I failed"" (interrupted recent attempt) and ""Today was a Fwb visiting me,"" but the core suicide references are historical.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Specific methods described for past attempts: rope/chair (interrupted), wrist-cutting, lying on a road, train-jumping.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - **Multiple completed past attempts**: Cutting wrists (age 11), lying on a road (age 19), jumping in front of a train (age 24). These are concrete actions with intent to die.  
   - One interrupted recent action (standing on chair with rope), but this is outweighed by documented past attempts.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide content + descriptions of **completed past actions** (wrist-cutting, road, train) → **ATTEMPT** per classification rules.  
   - Rule 4: Focus on past actions takes precedence. Rule 5: Past attempts override concurrent behaviors/ideations.

As of right now I don't have any plans to end it, but I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come. Even if that means I die at 50 or earlier. I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be. Especially when I see that the future is really grim.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains phrases like ""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" and ""die at 50 or earlier."" However, there is **no explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, ending life, or wanting to die. The user explicitly states: ""I don't have any plans to end it.""  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). References to timing are vague (""when my time has come,"" ""at 50 or earlier"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Mentions stopping doctor visits but frames it as passive acceptance of natural death rather than a suicide method. No specific plans, preparations, or methods (e.g., pills, weapons) are described.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Stopping medical care is noted, but this is not a suicide attempt or self-harm action. No past attempts or interrupted actions are mentioned.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - **No explicit suicide/death wishes** are present (only acceptance of potential early natural death).  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""future is really grim"") and disengagement from healthcare, but **without suicidal intent**.  
   - Falls under **INDICATOR**: Distress and life dissatisfaction without explicit suicide ideation.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Acceptance of death ≠ explicit suicide wish (e.g., ""I want to be dead"").  
- Passive neglect (e.g., avoiding doctors) without suicidal intent is not a plan/method.  
- ""When in doubt"" rule: No explicit suicide mention → INDICATOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" in the phrase: ""too much of a coward to kill myself."" This is a direct reference to suicide, satisfying the explicit mention criterion regardless of the context (e.g., claiming reluctance to act).

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate timing words (""tonight,"" ""now"") or past attempt descriptions. The tone is general/ongoing (""I'm too much,"" ""too depressed"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned. The phrase ""starve myself"" is contextualized as a weight-loss action, not a suicide plan.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No references to past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""kill myself"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → IDEATION (explicit suicidal thought without actionable details).  
   - ""Starve myself"" is not tied to suicide intent → Does not elevate to BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempt described → Rules out ATTEMPT.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
   - Explicit mention of suicide (Rule 1) mandates classification beyond INDICATOR.  
   - No method/plan (Rule 5: IDEATION > BEHAVIOR threshold not met).  
   - Reluctance (""coward"") does not negate explicit ideation (Rule 2).

Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   The post mentions ""thinking about suicide"" in the context of helping a friend. However, the author does NOT express personal suicidal thoughts, death wishes, or desires to end their own life. The suicide reference is purely hypothetical/descriptive about others.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   No personal timelines (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""I want to"") or past actions (""I tried"") from the author. All references are general advice about supporting others.

   No methods, locations, preparations, or research related to the author. The discussion focuses on emotional support strategies.

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   No description of past personal suicide attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions by the author.

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""driving me further to killing myself,"" ""nature is just telling me it's time to die.""  
   - Context: All express active suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""becoming content"" with suicide as a purpose).  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current/ongoing: ""I feel like I am finally becoming content,"" ""driving me further"" (implies progressive intent).  
   - No immediate time markers (e.g., ""tonight""), but distress is acute (""last Ativan today,"" ""end to me"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research mentioned.  
   - Stopping medication/drinking indicates self-harm but not suicide planning.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No past attempts described (e.g., ""I tried""). Mentions lying to avoid commitment, but no prior suicide actions.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""killing myself,"" ""time to die"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → Rules out BEHAVIOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicide through phrases like ""drowning yourself,"" ""guaranteed death,"" and ""transition to death."" The statement ""I think I might go and do that"" directly links drowning to a personal action.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The plan is conditional (""If I get kicked out""), indicating future intent rather than immediate action. No past attempts or urgent timing words (e.g., ""tonight"") are present.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method (drowning) and location (ocean) are detailed. The user evaluates its effectiveness (""guaranteed death"") and describes the process (""slowly sinking to the bottom"").  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. Focus is on potential future behavior.

We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""surely, suicide is appropriate now?"", ""Death seems a better option"", ""I don't want to live... and I want out"".  
   - Clear expressions of death wishes and rejection of life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Uses ""now"" and present-tense despair (""I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this""), indicating current distress but no immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" which directly references suicide and death wishes. Even though it's phrased as ""not to kill myself"" and ""postpone any suicide attempts,"" the explicit mention of suicide still counts according to the rules (e.g., ""wanting to die"" or ""suicide attempts"" are explicit, regardless of negation or postponement).

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The timing is future-oriented with no immediacy (e.g., ""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so""). There are no indicators of current/imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") or past events (e.g., ""I tried""). It suggests general/ongoing thoughts but delayed by external factors.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned (e.g., no details like pills, jumping, or acquiring means). The references to suicide are general and lack concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" implies future intent, not completed actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself,"" ""suicide attempts""), but no plan/method is indicated. According to the classification rules, this falls under IDEATION (explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods). The critical rules reinforce this: any explicit suicide mention triggers IDEATION over INDICATOR, and there is no evidence for BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post includes explicit expressions of death wishes: ""I have absolutely no will to live anymore"" and ""I just want to end it all."" These phrases directly indicate a desire not to be alive and to end life, aligning with the framework's inclusion of euphemisms like ""end it all"" in the context of distress.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language reflects ongoing distress (e.g., ""tired of living like this every day,"" ""trudge on like this for another 50-60 years"") but lacks immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The focus is on persistent feelings rather than imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The phrase ""end it all"" is vague and does not describe a plan or means.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content centers on current thoughts and emotions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""no will to live,"" ""end it all""), but no plan, method, or preparation is described. This matches the IDEATION category per the rules: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specifics on how.  
   - Critical rules reinforce this:  
     - ""End it all"" is explicit, so not INDICATOR.  
     - No method or plan, so not BEHAVIOR.  
     - No past actions, so not ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly states: ""I'm going to kill myself."" This is a direct mention of suicide, falling under phrases like ""going to die"" or ""kill myself"" as defined. Even amidst expressions of self-loathing and worthlessness, this clear reference to suicide must be flagged.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""I'm going to kill myself"" uses ""going to,"" indicating current or imminent intent, but it lacks specific timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It conveys a present desire rather than a past event or general thought.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location (e.g., bridge) is mentioned. There is no description of preparations, research, or acquisition of means. The statement is general, without details on how the suicide would be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on current feelings and future intent, not historical actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm going to kill myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Since there is no plan, method, or preparation described, it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past completed suicide attempt is mentioned, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicidal thoughts but no specific plan or method, it falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit mention of suicide (""I'm going to kill myself"") overrides any implicit distress, confirming IDEATION.  
- No ambiguity between categories: The presence of explicit suicide thoughts without method/plan solidifies IDEATION.  
- Focus is solely on the author's current state; no external references alter the classification.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of death wishes: ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me."" These phrases indicate a desire to die or end life, falling under explicit expressions like ""wanting to die"" or ""don't want to survive."" Even though the tone is distressed, the suicide/death content is clear and direct.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""again"" suggests recurring feelings, but there are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The distress is described as current (""Until now,"" ""I'm back to feeling like shit""), but it lacks specificity about acting on suicidal thoughts imminently. This points to general/ongoing feelings rather than urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations (e.g., bridges), preparations (e.g., writing notes), or research are mentioned. The post focuses on emotional state and life stressors, not concrete plans for suicide.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to...""), interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The word ""again"" implies previous feelings but not actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""Feel like dying again,"" ""Just kill me""), but there is no plan/method or preparation described. There is also no mention of a past attempt. According to the rules, this fits IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.  
   - Critical rules applied:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post describes distress from insomnia, harassment by neighbors and landlord, a recent MS diagnosis, and feelings of paranoia and hopelessness (e.g., ""I'm so tired,"" ""My heads messing with me,"" ""I cant take this torture,"" ""this is hell"").  
   - There are no explicit mentions of suicide, killing oneself, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive. Phrases like ""I just wanna leave this place"" and ""I want to leave"" refer to escaping the living situation, not death or suicide.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The distress is ongoing (e.g., ""slept an hour every night,"" ""It never fails""), but there are no immediate or past suicide-related timelines mentioned.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are discussed. The content focuses on external stressors.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- No explicit suicide content; phrases about ""leaving"" are contextual and not death-related.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""Possible suicide date is in July,"" which directly references suicide and a desire to die. Phrases like ""suicide date"" fall under ""ending life"" or ""wanting to die,"" making this an explicit expression of suicide.  
   
2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The mention of ""July"" as a ""possible suicide date"" indicates a future-specific timing, not immediate (e.g., not ""tonight"" or ""now""). ""Debating it"" suggests ongoing consideration but lacks urgency.  
   
3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Setting a ""suicide date"" is a specific plan element, indicating preparation. Although no method (e.g., pills, jumping) is described, the date itself constitutes a plan under the framework (as ""specific plans"" include timing).  
   
4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No references to past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried""). The focus is on future intent.  
   
5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicide date""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific plan (the date) is mentioned, so it meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR (explicit thoughts + plan/preparation).  
   - Not ATTEMPT, as no past completed action is described.  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The phrase ""Possible suicide date"" is explicit, and a date qualifies as a plan, even with ""possible"" indicating uncertainty.  
- Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR: The date is a plan element, so BEHAVIOR is chosen.

   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts,"" as well as ""kill myself."" Even though the person states they ""probably never kill myself"" due to religious reasons, the explicit reference to suicide and death wishes is present, which meets the criteria for suicide-related content.

   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is about thoughts, not actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present, so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - There are no plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - No past attempts are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, based on the rule that explicit suicide thoughts without a plan/method classify as IDEATION, this post fits IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- The explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" qualifies as IDEATION, even with the caveat that the person may not act on them (per the Intrusive Thoughts rule).  
- No doubt between categories: explicit content rules out INDICATOR, and no plan/action rules out BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.

Fucked it up. I sent my (ex) boyfriend creepy messages because i'm a fucking idiot and of course no one wanted to be friends with me anymore. I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic. No one from my real life, no classmates or family, none of them. just some random woman who lives on an entire different continent. I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve. I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one. this year has been such a beautiful downward spiral it would be an amazing way to end it, no?. i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit mentions: ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" and ""suicide notes"" (x3). ""Ending it all"" is a direct suicide reference, and suicide notes confirm intent.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Specific timing: ""on new year's eve"" (future but planned). Also references past actions: ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year"".  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Mentions concrete preparations: creating suicide notes (x4 total). While no method is specified, notes are explicit preparations.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Describes past preparatory actions (writing notes) but no physical attempt (e.g., no overdose, cutting).  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide wish (""ending it all"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - Preparations (multiple notes) → Elevates beyond IDEATION.  
   - No description of a *completed* suicide attempt → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   → Classification: **BEHAVIOR** (thoughts + preparations).

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post mentions ""I tried to cut myself,"" which is a self-harm behavior. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (e.g., no phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""want to be dead""). The context (""wanted to feel something real"") suggests self-harm for emotional regulation, not suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The event occurred ""last night,"" indicating a past action. There are no current/immediate time references (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") expressing ongoing suicidal thoughts or plans.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Cutting is mentioned as a method, but it is framed as self-harm (""to feel something real"") rather than part of a suicide plan. No specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research are described.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The person describes a past self-harm action (""tried to cut myself"") during a breakdown. While this is a concerning behavior, it is not presented as a suicide attempt (no intent to die indicated; instead, the reason is to ""feel something real"").

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide or death wishes (only self-harm), this falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses distress and a life problem (breakdown) but lacks any suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt. Self-harm alone, without suicidal intent, is categorized under INDICATOR per the framework (which includes severe distress without explicit suicide content).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""plan to kill myself"" and ""Why shouldn't i?"" directly mention suicide and questioning reasons against it.  
   - Additional context: ""no purpose to live"" implies hopelessness but isn't explicit suicide content.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - ""Plan to"" indicates current contemplation but lacks immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""plan to kill myself"").  
   - Absence of methods/preparations → **IDEATION**.  
   - Critical Rule 5: ""Why shouldn't I?"" is rhetorical without method → still IDEATION.

Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killing yourself soon"" and uses phrases like ""surprise em with it,"" which directly refer to suicide and death wishes. This is not implicit; it is an explicit expression of wanting to die or end one's life.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The word ""soon"" indicates a general future timing, but there are no immediate indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The phrase ""I have no worries of being stopped"" suggests consideration of potential intervention, but it doesn't specify urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or locations (e.g., bridges). The post discusses informing others (""let folks know"") or not (""surprise em""), which relates to communication about the act, but this is not a plan, method, or preparation for suicide itself. It is about the aftermath or disclosure, not the means.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I did""). The content is focused on future intentions and hypothetical scenarios.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""killing yourself soon""), but no specific plan, method, or preparation is described. The query about informing others does not constitute a method or behavioral step toward suicide. According to the framework, this falls under IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans or methods.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The explicit mention of suicide rules out INDICATOR.  
- No method or plan details (e.g., only general discussion of disclosure) means it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
- No past actions described, so ATTEMPT is not applicable.  
- When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, the absence of a method leans toward IDEATION.  
- The focus is solely on the writer's own suicidal thoughts.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""I think I'll kill myself tonight"" and ""I want to kill myself so bad."" Phrases like ""hang myself"" directly reference suicide methods. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The word ""tonight"" indicates immediate timing, suggesting current intent. There are no references to past events, only present/future actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   A specific method is mentioned: ""hang myself."" A location is specified: ""at the woods."" Preparations are described: ""I'll play my favorite music ever,"" which indicates planning the act. This shows a clear plan and method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post focuses on future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present, so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific plan and method are mentioned (hanging in the woods with music), so it cannot be IDEATION.  
   - No past completed action is described, so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - With explicit thoughts AND a plan/method, this classifies as BEHAVIOR.  

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- Explicit content is clear (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself"").  
- No intrusive thoughts or past attempts; focus is on current plan.  
- ""When in doubt"" rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to method/plan mention.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I want to kill myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal intent. This satisfies the requirement for explicit suicide/death content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The phrase ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching"" indicates a specific, imminent timeline (current/planned action), and ""already started to cancel friendships"" shows ongoing preparatory steps.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - While no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned, the post describes concrete preparations: setting a date and canceling friendships. These actions align with ""describing preparations"" under the BEHAVIOR category.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself"" or actions like an overdose). The focus is on future intent with current preparations, not a completed past action.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""I want to kill myself"") are present.  
   - Specific plans/preparations are mentioned (setting a date and canceling friendships).  
   - This matches the BEHAVIOR classification: explicit suicidal thoughts with plans/preparations, but no past attempt.  
   - Not IDEATION because plans/preparations exist; not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described; not INDICATOR due to explicit suicide mention.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit suicide mention triggers IDEATION or higher; preparations elevate it to BEHAVIOR.  
- ""Setting a date"" and ""canceling friendships"" are preparatory actions, falling under BEHAVIOR.  
- No past attempt, so not ATTEMPT.  
- Rule 5: Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to plan/preparation.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" (""i have to so i dont kill myself"") and directly discusses suicide (""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death""). This qualifies as explicit expressions of death wishes or suicidal thoughts.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Phrases like ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" suggest an ongoing, general struggle rather than immediate urgency (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). The tone is contemplative and persistent, not time-bound.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The question about suicide is philosophical (""Is suicide really as bad..."") and not focused on methods or planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""i dont kill myself"" implies prevention of action, not a history of attempts.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (from Step 1), but no plan, method, or preparation is identified (Step 3). No past attempt is described (Step 4). Therefore, based on the logic: explicit thoughts without plan/method → IDEATION.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - Explicit mentions like ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" trigger IDEATION, even with resistance (""i have to so i dont"").  
     - No ambiguity with BEHAVIOR (no method) or ATTEMPT (no past action).  
     - When in doubt, choose IDEATION over INDICATOR due to explicit suicide content.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" twice. This matches the framework's examples for explicit expressions of death wishes (e.g., ""I want to die"", ""I don't want to be alive"").  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate timing words (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"") or past attempts are mentioned. The tone is general/ongoing (""I want to die but I'm too much of a coward"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are described. The user explicitly states they feel unable to act (""too much of a coward to do it"").  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No mention of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""want to die"") are present → **Not INDICATOR**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation mentioned → **IDEATION** (per rules: explicit thoughts without plan/method).

But now i am at peace, no longer in pain, locked in the bathroom while my friends text me endlessly about how im ""ignoring"" them, but in reality i dont have the confidence to even say a word to them knowing it might as well be my last. Ive planned it all out, this is just a way of dying, knowing somebody noticed, and i feel cared about and worth it for the last few seconds i can ever memorize.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""throw myself off a bridge,"" ""i've been suicidal since i was 9,"" ""i dont want to be here,"" ""way of dying,"" and ""last few seconds i can ever memorize."" These phrases directly reference ending life or wanting to die.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Current/immediate indicators are present: ""Goodbye"" implies imminent action, ""before i littitimatly decide to throw myself off a bridge"" suggests decision-making is underway, and ""locked in the bathroom"" indicates a real-time situation. Phrases like ""last few seconds"" convey high urgency.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method and plan are described: ""throw myself off a bridge"" identifies a method (jumping) and implies a location (bridge). Additionally, ""Ive planned it all out"" explicitly states preparation, and ""this is just a way of dying"" reinforces the method. The context of being ""locked in the bathroom"" while ignoring friends may indicate preparatory isolation.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - Past self-harm is mentioned (""i self-harmed""), but it is not explicitly described as a suicide attempt (e.g., no details of intent to die from the action). The focus is on current planning, not a past completed attempt. The phrase ""i fifnt want to be here"" (likely a typo for ""didn't want to be here"") links to distress but does not specify a past suicide attempt.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""suicidal,"" ""throw myself off a bridge"").  
   - A specific plan and method are also mentioned (""throw myself off a bridge,"" ""planned it all out"").  
   - No completed past suicide attempt is described; self-harm is noted but not classified as an attempt under the rules.  
   - Applying the logic: Explicit thoughts + plan/method → BEHAVIOR.  
   - ""When in Doubt"" rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to the method/plan mention.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""I'm gonna commit suicide"" and ""die of blood loss,"" which are direct expressions of suicidal intent and death wishes. Phrases like ""I'm gonna twist my dick off"" also imply a desire for self-inflicted death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The repeated use of ""I'm gonna"" (e.g., ""I'm gonna twist my dick off,"" ""I'm gonna commit suicide,"" ""I'm gonna wait it off"") indicates immediate intent and current planning, with no reference to past events.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method is described: ""twist my dick off"" to cause fatal ""blood loss."" The phrase ""I sure am gonna try here"" suggests active preparation or intent to carry out the method.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or actions. The language is future-oriented (e.g., ""gonna""), focusing on planned behavior rather than completed events.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""commit suicide"") AND a specific method/preparation (""twist my dick off"" to ""die of blood loss""). According to the rules, this combination falls under BEHAVIOR. It does not describe a past completed action, so it is not ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post mentions ""I will eventually die in a much painful way"" and ""I have no reason to live,"" but these are not explicit expressions of suicide or death wishes. The death is framed as a consequence of the disease (""My disease are getting worse""), not as a self-initiated action. There is no direct mention of suicide, killing oneself, ending life, or wanting to die (e.g., no phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""want to die""). ""Sayonara"" (meaning goodbye) is ambiguous but not an explicit suicide reference in this context of illness.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - ""Will eventually die"" suggests a future event tied to disease progression, not immediate or current suicidal intent (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). The phrase ""for years"" indicates ongoing suffering, but no timing related to suicidal actions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research mentioned. The focus is on the disease causing death.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or actions taken).

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die (only distress and hopelessness due to illness), this falls under INDICATOR according to the rule: ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR.""
   - The expressions of loneliness, physical pain, mental depression, and having ""no reason to live"" align with INDICATOR, which covers severe distress without explicit suicidal intent.

**Critical Rules Applied:**
- Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I will eventually die"" is implicit and disease-related, not an explicit suicide wish. ""I have no reason to live"" indicates hopelessness but not a desire for self-harm.
- When in Doubt: Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, choose IDEATION only if explicit suicide mention exists; here, none is present, so INDICATOR is appropriate.
- Suicide risk is only for the person writing; no other people are mentioned.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I'll still be suicidal lol"" directly references suicidal state.  
   - Additional expressions: ""Why can't that be me?"" (envying death), ""killing yourself"" (direct phrasing), and ""I wish I was dead"" implied in comparisons.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate time references (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").  
   - Uses ongoing/general terms: ""still be suicidal,"" ""couldn't help but think,"" indicating persistent thoughts without imminent intent.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No specific methods (pills, weapons), locations, or preparations described.  
   - Rhetorical question (""Surely killing yourself isn’t so hard right?"") discusses difficulty but lacks actionable plans or research.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No mention of past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions. Focus is on thoughts and envy, not actions taken.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide references (""suicidal,"" ""killing yourself"") confirm suicide content.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of past attempts rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - Classification falls under IDEATION due to expressed suicidal thoughts without plans.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- ""I'll still be suicidal"" is explicit per Rule 1, overriding contextual tone.  
- No method/plan triggers IDEATION per Rule 5 (IDEATION > BEHAVIOR threshold).  
- Focus remains solely on the author’s stated feelings (Rule 1).

Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   The post explicitly mentions ""wants to die"" (""Am I the only one who wants to die..."") and references death-related concepts like ""going to hell"" and ""keeping me alive."" This qualifies as an explicit expression of death wishes or not wanting to be alive, even though the person is conflicted about acting on it.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   The language is general and ongoing, with phrases like ""wants to die"" (present tense), ""I keep worrying about it,"" and ""I've been feeling really isolated recently."" There are no immediate timing indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") or references to past suicide attempts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on abstract fears (e.g., going to hell) and emotional struggles, not concrete plans.

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""I am and have done some bad shit"" is vague and does not refer to suicide-related actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""wants to die""), but there is no plan, method, or preparation described.  
   - This fits the IDEATION category, as defined by explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans.  
   - Critical rules applied:  
     - The explicit mention of death wishes triggers IDEATION, even if the person expresses conflict (e.g., fear keeping them alive).  
     - No evidence of behavior or attempt, so no escalation.  
     - When in doubt between INDICATOR and IDEATION, IDEATION is chosen due to explicit content.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""I thought of killing myself multiple times."" This is a direct reference to suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The suicidal thoughts are described in the past (""thought of,"" ""multiple times"") with no current/immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""). Current distress is emphasized, but suicide is framed as a past consideration.

   There are no specific urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The language is general, focusing on a desire to die without immediate timing.

   There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. The content is about current intentions and research.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to definitely die"").  
   - A plan/method component is also present through the seeking of information on how to die.  
   - According to the rules: Explicit thoughts + plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.  
   - The critical rule ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned"" applies here, as seeking information qualifies as part of the plan/method assessment.

475,"It Never Quite Goes Away. I stick around for other people, but not because I want to be alive. It's not just that I don't see a future for myself, I just don't really want one either. It does get better, and then it gets worse, and then it gets better, and then worse, etc. I'm tired of buying time from myself over and over again. I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly? Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore. Maybe that's shitty. Maybe it's that 'indifference toward other people' that they were talking about when I got diagnosed with PTSD (still reeling from that one, it never seemed bad enough to me. Turns out not everyone lives in constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation). I just don't care. I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail. And in the meantime, I guess I'm still trying. I'm always trying.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step-by-Step Analysis Using the Framework

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes:  
     - ""the same familiar will to die"" directly expresses a desire for death.  
     - ""If I do it"" refers to suicide (implied by context of ""attempt"").  
     - ""if I do attempt again"" explicitly mentions a suicide attempt.  
     - ""I'm not going to fail"" in the context of attempting suicide indicates intent.  
   - Phrases like ""not because I want to be alive"" and ""I don't see a future for myself"" reinforce hopelessness but are not standalone explicit suicide mentions; however, the explicit terms above qualify.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - The post states ""I'm not in immediate danger,"" indicating no current urgency.  
   - Timing is future-oriented: ""it'll be at least a few months out"" for any potential action.  
   - References to past are indirect via ""attempt again,"" implying a history.  
   - General/ongoing themes: ""Sometimes I just don't care,"" ""I'm always trying,"" and cyclical descriptions of distress.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned.  
   - ""I've made enough plans to look forward to"" refers to life-oriented plans (distractions), not suicide plans.  
   - ""I'm not going to fail"" implies confidence but lacks detail on method or preparation.  
   - No evidence of current plans, methods, or interrupted actions (e.g., no descriptions of initiated but stopped attempts).

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - A past suicide attempt is explicitly referenced: ""if I do attempt again"" confirms a history of at least one completed attempt.  
   - No details about the past attempt (e.g., method or outcome) are provided, but the word ""again"" confirms it occurred.

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (e.g., ""will to die,"" ""attempt""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described for current suicidal thoughts, so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - A past completed suicide attempt is mentioned (""attempt again""), which directly qualifies for ATTEMPT classification per the rules: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" Here, past attempt is mentioned, and there is implied current ideation (e.g., ""if I do it""), but the key trigger is the reference to past action.  
   - Per critical rules: Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT, choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions, which applies here.

**Conclusion**: The mention of a past suicide attempt (""attempt again"") mandates ATTEMPT classification, as per the framework's rules, regardless of current details.

476,"My temptations will soon get the better of me. Every day the pain gets worse. For the past week, I haven't thought about anything other than how and when I'm going to take my life. It's peaceful to think about, to imagine myself free from everything. I can't see myself going on to live a normal life, or much of a life at all. I've fucked my education up, I've fucked my relationships with other people up, I've fucked up everything in my life. I simply won't live a comfortable life in the slightest, it'll only continue to get worse as it always has. At the stage I'm at, I don't even want to live a comfortable life anymore, I don't want any more chances. I just want the pain to stop. I'm only 16 and I've gone through enough of it to last multiple lifetimes. I'm too afraid to use any method aside from a gun to the head, though. Going by my plan, I still need to wait another 480 days until I'm able to. But I can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there. Where the fuck did everything go so wrong?",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicide with phrases like ""how and when I'm going to take my life"" and ""I don't want to live a comfortable life anymore."" These are direct expressions of wanting to die or end one's life, satisfying the criterion for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Urgency is evident through terms like ""soon"" (in ""My temptations will soon get the better of me""), ""can't wait any more,"" and ""Each day I've been more tempted,"" indicating current and escalating impulses. The reference to ""another 480 days"" shows future timing, but the immediate temptation to act (e.g., ""grab a kitchen knife and do it there"") highlights present risk.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific suicide methods are detailed, including ""a gun to the head"" and ""grab a kitchen knife and do it there."" The phrase ""Going by my plan"" explicitly confirms the existence of a plan, with preparations implied (e.g., waiting for access to a gun or considering immediate use of a knife). This constitutes clear evidence of planning and method specification.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No descriptions of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors are present. The post focuses on thoughts, temptations, and plans, not completed or initiated actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""take my life""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - Specific plans and methods (gun, knife) are mentioned, so it exceeds IDEATION.  
   - No past completed actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - With explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/methods, this qualifies as BEHAVIOR.  
   - Applying critical rules: The explicit mention of methods and planning triggers BEHAVIOR, and there is no doubt given the clarity of the plan references.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" when asking if inpatient care helps people with such thoughts. This is a direct reference to suicide.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate timing words (""tonight,"" ""now"") or past actions (""I tried"") are present. The context is general/ongoing (""having thoughts of suicide"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The focus is on seeking treatment (""inpatient care,"" ""medication"").  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (""thoughts of suicide"") are present.  
   - **NO plan/method/preparation** is described.  
   - **NO past attempt** is mentioned.  
   - Classification aligns with **IDEATION** (explicit suicidal thoughts without plans/methods).  

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- ""Thoughts of suicide"" is an explicit mention, overriding distress themes (like ""convincing myself I deserve to live"").  
- Seeking help doesn’t downgrade the classification; explicit ideation remains.  
- No ambiguity: Explicit mention without plan → IDEATION.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday,"" which includes direct phrases like ""kill myself"" indicating suicide or death wishes.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - The phrase ""on Monday"" specifies a future time frame, indicating a planned action rather than immediate urgency. Words like ""going to"" also signal intent.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The word ""Bridge"" clearly indicates a specific method and location (implying jumping from a bridge), which falls under suicide planning.

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - There is no description of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions. The post focuses on future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"").  
   - A specific plan/method is mentioned (""Bridge"").  
   - According to the rules: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.""  
   - There is no description of a completed past action, so it does not qualify as ATTEMPT.  
   - The presence of a method (""Bridge"") means it cannot be IDEATION or INDICATOR.

**Critical Rules Check**:  
- Explicit suicide mention confirmed (""kill myself"").  
- ""Bridge"" is a specific location/method, satisfying BEHAVIOR criteria.  
- No past attempt described; focus is on future.  
- Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, BEHAVIOR is chosen due to method mention.  
- Risk is solely for the author (no other people involved).

Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it. And it's just can't get this girl out of my head. Good fore to stay away though. Not cool to start something and then  just kms. Gah but it's so hard. One of the hardest decisions I've taken iny life. Wish I have more sex before I go though lol. Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide or death wishes:
     - ""kms"" (abbreviation for ""kill myself"") appears twice: ""overcame a big hurdle to kms"" and ""just kms"".
     - ""when I do it"" refers to the act of killing oneself, based on context.
     - ""before I go"" implies dying or suicide, as it follows suicidal themes.
   - Even though some phrases are casual or include humor (""lol""), explicit references to suicide are present.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" suggests a past event related to suicide planning.
   - ""when I do it"" and ""before I go"" indicate future-oriented planning, but no immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" are used.
   - General distress is expressed (""it's so hard"", ""hardest decisions""), but the suicidal intent is not described as impulsive or immediate.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""hangman's noose"" as a wallpaper, which directly references hanging as a suicide method.
   - Setting the wallpaper is a form of preparation or reminder, as it is used to ""stay on track"" with suicidal thoughts.
   - No other specific locations, research, or detailed preparations are described, but the noose imagery constitutes a method reference.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - ""overcame a big hurdle to kms"" could imply past actions related to suicide (e.g., resolving obstacles), but it is vague and does not describe a concrete suicide attempt (e.g., no mention of actions like overdosing or self-harm).
   - Changing the wallpaper (""tried to sleep but then changed the wallpaper"") is not a suicide-related action; it reflects internal conflict but not an attempt.
   - No descriptions of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are present.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., ""kms"", ""do it"", ""go""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - A specific method (""hangman's noose"") is mentioned, and the wallpaper setting acts as a preparation, moving this beyond IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.
   - No past completed suicide attempt is described (e.g., ""overcame a big hurdle"" is not an attempt; it is preparatory), so it is not ATTEMPT.
   - Critical rules applied:
     - Explicit mentions are clear, so IDEATION is ruled out.
     - Method/preparation exists, so BEHAVIOR is chosen over IDEATION.
     - No completed past action, so ATTEMPT is not applicable.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts with a specific method (hanging via noose imagery) and preparation (setting wallpaper as a reminder), fitting the BEHAVIOR category.

I don't know how to undo the mess i've done with my life. I haven't been happy in 2 years now. it just seems like my adulthood is all downhill from here.

I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore. i'm only 19 and I feel like i've seen enough of my future to want to continue. someone please help me,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""I want to die,"" which is a direct expression of a death wish. Phrases like ""I feel like I wasn't supposed to be born"" and ""i've seen enough of my future to want to continue"" (interpreted as not wanting to continue living) also imply a desire to not exist, but the explicit statement ""I want to die"" is clear and qualifies as a suicide-related expression. The later phrase ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore"" shows ambivalence but does not negate the initial explicit mention, as per the rules (explicit mention still counts even if the person disclaims intent).

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language indicates ongoing distress (e.g., ""my mind always feels like clutter,"" ""I haven't been happy in 2 years now""), but there are no specific, immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now."" The feelings are described as persistent and general, not time-bound to the immediate future.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The post focuses on emotional pain, depression, anxiety, and feelings of failure, but lacks any concrete details about how suicide might be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post references life difficulties (e.g., quitting a job due to anxiety) but no actions related to suicide.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to die""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - There are no plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past suicide attempts are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, with explicit suicidal thoughts but no plan or method, it fits IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- The explicit mention of ""I want to die"" triggers IDEATION, regardless of the person's ambivalence or disclaimers.  
- No doubt between categories: explicit thought is present, but no plan or past attempt.  
- Classification is based solely on the author's expressions, not others.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The phrase ""getting it over with"" is an explicit reference to suicide. The framework includes ""want it to be over"" as a suicide-related expression.  
   - Context reinforces this: ""I feel like he'll be better off without me"" implies death would improve others' lives.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Uses present-tense language (""I've been thinking""), indicating ongoing ideation without immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now.""

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""getting it over with"") → Requires IDEATION or higher.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Rules out BEHAVIOR.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die,"" ""exit bag,"" ""purchased a gun,"" ""purchased rope,"" ""partial suspension hanging.""  
   - Death-focused language: ""I'll just be 100% honest"" (contextualized with suicide attempts), ""I want to be gone"" (implied in actions).  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - Past events dominate: Details attempts at ages 15 (aspirin overdose) and 21 (gun incident), plus recent hanging attempt.  
   - Current setup: References ""today"" with the exit bag preparation but no active/imminent action.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Specific methods: Aspirin overdose, gunshot to the head, partial suspension hanging, exit bag (helium suffocation).  
   - Preparations: Research on methods (WebMD, gunshot accuracy), acquiring means (pills, gun, rope, gas), testing setups.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - **Past completed attempts:**  
     - Age 15: Took 120 aspirin pills (resulted in hospitalization).  
     - Age 21: Pulled trigger on gun (misfire prevented death).  
     - Recent: Attempted partial hanging (resulted in physical injury).  
   - Current exit bag setup is a preparation, but no action taken beyond testing.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide content and multiple methods → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - Detailed plans/preparations for current exit bag → Rules out IDEATION.  
   - **Key factor: Past completed actions** (overdose, gun trigger pull, hanging attempt) with intent to die → Matches ATTEMPT definition.  
   - Critical Rule 4: Focus on past actions (completed attempts) over current plans.  
   - Critical Rule 5: Between BEHAVIOR (current prep) and ATTEMPT (past actions), prioritize ATTEMPT due to concrete past actions.

   The phrase ""should just end my life"" is an explicit mention of suicide/death wishes.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   No immediate time references (""tonight,"" ""now"") or past attempt descriptions. The language (""should"") suggests contemplation rather than immediacy.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations, or research mentioned.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   No references to past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""end my life"") → Rules out INDICATOR.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Rules out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No description of past completed actions → Rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - Falls under IDEATION per framework: explicit wish to die without plans/methods.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states ""I'm about to kill myself"" – a direct mention of suicide. Phrases like ""I don't see a reason to live"" and ""Life sucks"" reinforce distress but are secondary to the explicit suicide statement.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   ""I'm about to"" indicates imminent intent (current/immediate timeframe).  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparation described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit references to death and dying: ""face death,"" ""until i die,"" ""if i survived,"" and ""if not, well, you know what happened."" These phrases indicate a direct expression of willingness to confront or risk death, which aligns with suicide-related content (e.g., ""wanting to die"" or ""being dead"").

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The language shows immediacy: ""I'm now gonna start"" and the 12-hour timeframe (""I'll be back in 12 hours if i survived"") indicate current action and urgency. The phrase ""gonna embrace the pain and face death"" suggests an ongoing, intentional engagement with self-destructive behavior.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is described: ""working out until i die or pass out."" This is a concrete plan involving excessive physical exertion with the stated goal of risking death. It qualifies as a method because it outlines a deliberate action intended to cause harm or death.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No past suicide attempts are mentioned (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I did""). The post focuses on current and future actions (""I'm now gonna start""), so this does not describe a completed past event.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (e.g., ""face death,"" ""until i die""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific plan/method (""working out until i die or pass out"") is included, so it cannot be IDEATION.  
   - The behavior is current and involves initiation of a plan (starting to work out with the intent to risk death), making it BEHAVIOR. Since there is no description of a completed past action (e.g., ""I tried to work out until I passed out""), it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Applying critical rules:  
     - Explicit death references confirm suicide content.  
     - The method (working out to death) and immediacy align with BEHAVIOR.  
     - ""When in doubt"" rule: Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because a method is mentioned.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses explicit suicidal intent with a specific plan and immediate action, fitting the BEHAVIOR category.

I'm sorry for the question but I was hoping someone would be able to talk and help me figure it out.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions ""contemplated suicide for years,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" and ""if I plan to be dead long before I retire."" These phrases directly reference suicide, death wishes, and intent to die, satisfying the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The timing is not immediate; the post references a future timeframe (""maybe in my 20's or 30's"") and general/ongoing contemplation (""for years""). There are no indicators of current/immediate action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The discussion focuses on life planning (retirement) and vague future intent (""I know I am going to do it""), but lacks concrete details about how suicide would be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post only refers to contemplation (""contemplated suicide"") and future intent, not past actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""contemplated suicide,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" ""plan to be dead"").  
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, so it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempts are mentioned, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
   - Therefore, the classification is IDEATION, as per the rule: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes rule out INDICATOR.  
- The absence of methods or plans means it cannot be BEHAVIOR.  
- No past actions are described, so it is not ATTEMPT.  
- Per the ""When in Doubt"" rule: With explicit suicide thoughts but no method, IDEATION is chosen.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions death with the phrase ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" This is a direct reference to causing death, even though it is phrased as a question. The context of distress is implied by the statement ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later,"" which connects the inquiry about lethality to personal possession of the means. This constitutes an explicit expression related to suicide/death.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The phrase ""saving for later"" indicates future intent rather than immediate action (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now""). There are no references to past attempts or events. The timing is general/ongoing, suggesting preparation rather than imminent risk.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post specifies a method (duloxetine pills) and describes preparations (""saving for later""). This shows acquisition and retention of means for potential use. Additionally, asking ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" constitutes seeking information about suicide methods, which aligns with BEHAVIOR criteria.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The focus is on current possession and future intent.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide/death content is present (""kill you"").  
   - A specific method (pills) and preparation (saving them) are mentioned.  
   - According to the rules, explicit thoughts with method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.  
   - This is not a past attempt, so ATTEMPT does not apply.  
   - When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if any method/plan is mentioned (as here).

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- The suicide risk pertains to the author (use of ""I"").  
- ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" is explicit in context, and saving pills indicates preparation.  
- Seeking information about methods (e.g., lethality of pills) qualifies as BEHAVIOR.  
- No past actions described, so not ATTEMPT.

If anyone or anything truely cared about my life I know it isn't me. Not anymore. I feel so empire. So out of place with everyone I'm around. I just want to end but haven't yet.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - The phrase ""I just want to end but haven't yet"" explicitly expresses a desire to end one's life. ""Want to end"" is equivalent to ""want it to be over"" or ""don't want to survive"" in the context of distress (e.g., ""It's hell,"" ""I feel so empty""). This qualifies as an explicit death wish, even if not using the word ""suicide.""

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS**:  
   - The post indicates current distress (""Today's a great day. It's hell,"" ""I feel so empty"") but lacks immediate timing words like ""tonight"" or ""now."" ""Haven't yet"" suggests no imminent action.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. The expression is general (""want to end"").

4. **ACTION HISTORY**:  
   - No description of past attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. ""Haven't yet"" confirms no prior action was taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC**:  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to end""), but no plan or method is mentioned. Therefore, based on the rules, this falls under IDEATION.

489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of death and suicide: ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" and ""I cant off myself"" (where ""off myself"" is a colloquial expression for suicide). These phrases directly reference wanting to die or killing oneself.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - There is a current/immediate indicator: ""dead by the end of the day today"" suggests urgency tied to the present day.  
   - General/ongoing elements are present: ""every day I just get too tired"" and procrastination themes, but the immediate timing (""today"") takes precedence for risk assessment.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""go buy the gas"" (likely referring to acquiring materials for suicide by gas asphyxiation or poisoning). This indicates a concrete plan, even though the person states they haven't acted due to not leaving the house.  

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No description of past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm. The post focuses on thoughts and hypothetical actions (e.g., ""if I never leave the house""), not completed past events.  

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""dead by the end of the day,"" ""off myself""), so it cannot be INDICATOR.  
   - A specific method (""buy the gas"") is mentioned, so it cannot be IDEATION (which requires no method).  
   - No evidence of a completed past action (e.g., ""I tried""), so it cannot be ATTEMPT.  
   - With explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method described, this meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit mentions like ""dead"" and ""off myself"" trigger higher classification per Rule 1.  
- Mention of a method (""buy the gas"") moves it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR per Rule 5 (between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR if any method is mentioned).  
- The focus is on the writer's current thoughts and plans, not past actions.

490,"I should stop being a pussy and do it. I post about suicide constantly, I should just suck it up and do it already.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly mentions suicide through the phrase ""I post about suicide constantly,"" and the repeated use of ""do it"" in context clearly refers to acting on suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already""). This indicates an explicit expression of wanting to die or commit suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Words like ""should"" and ""already"" imply a sense of urgency or that acting is overdue, but there are no specific immediate timing indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The focus is on current desire rather than past events.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging), location, preparation, or research. The post urges self-action but lacks concrete details on how suicide would be carried out.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post references frequent posting about suicide but does not describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm behaviors. Statements like ""I post about suicide constantly"" indicate expression of thoughts, not completed actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (via ""do it"" in context of suicide and direct mention of posting about suicide).  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is described, ruling out BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempt is described, ruling out ATTEMPT.  
   - Since there are explicit suicide thoughts without a specific plan or method, this falls under IDEATION.  

**Critical Rules Check:**  
- ""Do it"" is explicit due to the suicide context, satisfying IDEATION criteria.  
- No doubt between categories: Explicit suicide mention excludes INDICATOR; no method excludes BEHAVIOR; no past action excludes ATTEMPT.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   Explicit mentions include: ""planned to kill myself in the forest,"" ""plan to hang myself,"" and ""end it"" (in context of suicide). These are clear expressions of suicidal intent.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   Current/immediate language: ""I plan to hang myself,"" ""Everything is ready,"" and ""it time to stop the lie and end it"" indicate present intent and preparation.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods described: ""hang myself in the highest tree"" and ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" Preparations confirmed: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car.""

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   Mentions past self-harm (""started to cut my rights leg"") and a prior suicide plan (""planned to kill myself in the forest in January""), but no completed attempt is described. The current plan is new and active.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts (IDEATION threshold met).  
   - Specific methods and preparations confirmed (escalates to BEHAVIOR).  
   - No description of a past completed attempt (rules out ATTEMPT).

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post contains phrases like ""going to die anyway"" and ""wish I was never born,"" but explicitly states ""don't really want to die.""  
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, or wanting to die. ""Wish I was never born"" expresses regret about existence but not active death wishes.  

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - No immediate timing words (""tonight,"" ""now""). General existential themes (""what's the point"") without urgency.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - No references to past attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions.

I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The post describes feelings of shame, embarrassment, and anxiety about social judgment related to purchasing a sex toy and starting at a new school. Phrases like ""I am very ashamed,"" ""it's just fucked up,"" ""everyone knows about it and makes fun of me,"" ""I am afraid,"" and ""I am disgusting"" indicate distress but do not include any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die. Terms like ""disgusting"" refer to self-perception and social stigma, not death or suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   - The post references a future event (""about to start in a new school"") but focuses on fear of judgment, not imminent self-harm. There are no words indicating urgency for suicide (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""going to"" in a suicidal context). The distress is ongoing but not time-sensitive to suicide.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No mention of suicide methods, plans, locations, preparations, or research. The content revolves around past actions (buying the item, starting nofap) and future concerns about social interactions, not self-harm.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   - The post describes non-suicidal past actions (buying a sex toy and engaging in nofap). There is no reference to suicide attempts, self-harm behaviors, or interrupted suicide-related actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - No explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned, so the classification is INDICATOR. The post expresses distress, hopelessness, and life problems (shame, fear of judgment) without any suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt.

**Critical Rules Applied:**  
- Explicit vs. Implicit: Distress is implicit (e.g., ""I messed up big time"") but lacks suicide-related language.  
- When in Doubt: No explicit suicide mention, so INDICATOR is chosen over IDEATION.  
- Focus: Risk assessment is solely on the author, with no suicide content detected.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post explicitly states: ""they dont let you kill yourself."" The phrase ""kill yourself"" is a direct reference to suicide/death wishes.

**1. SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
The post contains explicit expressions of death wishes:  
- ""pls fucking end me"" directly requests death.  
- ""im going to do it"" (in context of ""nobody cares till I say..."") implies suicidal intent (""it"" = suicide).  

**2. URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
- ""before the day"" suggests immediacy (within the current day).  
- No past attempts described.  

**3. PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
- No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations mentioned.  
- ""End me"" is a general plea, not a plan.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide: ""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family with a suicide.""
   - It also expresses a desire to die through the statement ""I hope it'll be me next"" (referring to being a victim of stabbing), which is an explicit death wish in the context of distress.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
   - The phrase ""I hope it'll be me next"" suggests a current or ongoing desire for death but lacks specific immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). It indicates a general wish rather than an immediate plan.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
   - The method of death discussed is stabbing, but it is framed as a passive hope for external violence (""I hope it'll be me next"") rather than an active plan or preparation by the person. There is no description of the person seeking, researching, or preparing for self-inflicted harm. The contrast with suicide (""it'll be just another stabbing"") implies a preference for accidental or external death over self-directed action, but no specific suicide method or plan is detailed.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**
   - No mention of past suicide attempts, self-harm actions, or interrupted attempts. The content focuses solely on current thoughts and wishes.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**
   - Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (suicide is directly mentioned, and the person expresses a desire to die), so it cannot be INDICATOR.
   - There is no specific plan, method, preparation, or research described for suicide (e.g., the stabbing is hoped for but not planned or initiated by the person). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.
   - No past completed suicide attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.
   - Based on the logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION,"" this falls under IDEATION. The person explicitly wants to die but has not outlined a personal plan or method for suicide.

**Critical Rules Applied:**
- Explicit mention of suicide and death wishes triggers IDEATION or higher, but no plan/method means it stays at IDEATION.
- Wishing for death through external means (e.g., stabbing) does not constitute a personal plan or behavior for suicide.
- No doubt between categories: Explicit content rules out INDICATOR; lack of plan rules out BEHAVIOR; no past action rules out ATTEMPT.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""killmyself"" (which is ""kill myself""), ""i want to put an end to it all"", ""so i can just kill myself"", and ""disappear"" in the context of dying (e.g., ""how can i just disappear?""). This satisfies the criteria for explicit suicide content.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The language indicates current and ongoing suicidal thoughts, with phrases like ""i want to"" and ""how can i"", but no specific immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). There are no references to past suicide attempts.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   The post describes specific plans and preparations for suicide: the user discusses changing identity, moving to another country to kill themselves ""with peace and with no one knowing it"", and suggests making it look like an accident. This shows concrete planning and method consideration, including seeking information with ""how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?"".

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions. The user states ""something blocking me to do that"", implying no prior action was taken.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present, so it is not INDICATOR.  
   - Specific plans and preparations are described (method, location, and setup), so it meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR.  
   - No past attempt is mentioned, so it is not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Rules Application:**  
- The explicit suicide content rules apply (e.g., ""kill myself"" is direct).  
- Planning elements (changing identity, moving countries to die secretly) qualify as BEHAVIOR.  
- No doubt between categories: explicit thoughts + plan = BEHAVIOR.

1. **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**  
   The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes, such as ""I tried to kill myself last night,"" ""I ALMOST KILL MYSELF,"" ""I FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL,"" and ""killing theirselves."" These phrases clearly indicate a desire to die or commit suicide.

2. **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**  
   The post references immediate timing with ""last night"" (past event) and ""tonight"" (future plan), along with urgent language like ""THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!"" This shows high urgency for both past and present suicidal intentions.

3. **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**  
   Specific methods are described: ""suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag"" for the past action, and a stated intent to ""try again tonight"" with the same or similar method. Additionally, a backup ""Plan B"" is mentioned, which is implied to be more painful, indicating preparation and consideration of alternatives.

4. **ACTION HISTORY:**  
   The post describes a past action: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation,"" but it was interrupted (""EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF, I FUCKING BREATHE""). This is an interrupted attempt, not a completed action, as the outcome was not death and the action was halted involuntarily.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Explicit suicide thoughts are present (e.g., wanting to die), and specific plans/methods are mentioned (suffocation, Plan B), so it is not IDEATION.  
   - The described past event is an interrupted attempt (action initiated but stopped), which falls under BEHAVIOR according to the rules (Interrupted Actions are BEHAVIOR, not ATTEMPT).  
   - ATTEMPT is reserved for completed past actions, which is not the case here (e.g., ""ALMOST KILL MYSELF"" indicates it was not completed).  
   - Current plans (""I'm gonna try again tonight"") reinforce the BEHAVIOR classification for ongoing risk.  
   - Critical rules: ""Interrupted Actions: ... this is BEHAVIOR"" and ""When in doubt between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions."" Here, the action was interrupted, so BEHAVIOR is appropriate.

   - There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The mention of a depressive episode is not linked to any suicidal actions.

5. **DECISION LOGIC:**  
   - Since there is NO explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die, this falls under INDICATOR. The post expresses distress (emptiness, tiredness, fear of ruining friendships) and general dissatisfaction with life, but without any suicidal elements.  
   - Rules clarification: Phrases like ""don't want to get out of bed"" or ""want to sleep 24/7"" indicate depression but are not explicit suicide content. Even with distress, the absence of death-related language means it cannot be classified as IDEATION, BEHAVIOR, or ATTEMPT.
